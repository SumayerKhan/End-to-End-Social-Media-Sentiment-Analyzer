    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I‚Äôd like to share the app I‚Äôve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI‚Äôve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn‚Äôt an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn‚Äôt have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies.¬†\n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I‚Äôm also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I‚Äôm actively looking for ideas to improve it.¬†\n\nThank you!¬†",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

For now it is essentially cosmetic. There is a tiny impact point on the corner with two hairline cracks. \nFrom what I have read of AppleCare One, it is required to have a new device to enroll in the plan initially ($20 monthly), then I would be able to add my 15 Pro Max for an additional $5.99 a month. What I have also read is that enrolling an older device into this service requires a remote diagnostic, which I am certain my phone would pass as I have already had it diagnosed at my local AASP. \nSo:\nSay I buy a new pair of AirPods and initiate AppleCare One coverage for them. Would it be reasonable to assume this could cover my phone as well? Say I have it submitted for a screen replacement at my AASP as soon as the quality of the display degrades. Would I be able to cancel my AppleCare One after this repair? Say this all happens in the span of two weeks and I return the AirPods to Best Buy. ",

    "selftext": "im having this weirdly specific problem where my phone is struggling to receive input when i touch it. when i tap things like letters on the keyboard or the keys on my passcode it will play the tapping animation as if it is working, but nothing will actually happen. i am so frustrated. it is lagging horribly, it'll tap things that i don't tap and this is making it borderline impossible to troubleshoot. but weirdly it'll work better if i use it really slowly?\n\ni have force reset, i have tried adjusting the touch settings, i can't exactly update in its unusable state\n\nit was working completely fine not even a minute before this started happening. am i doomed?\n\nso far i have only been able to find 2 other people with the same issue as me and none of the advice has worked so if anyone has a clue on what to do please help :(\n\n  \nUPDATE: i have found a way to momentarily fix it, WHEN I AM IN SETTINGS AND THE TOUCH BEHAVES FOR A SECOND I WILL HOLD AND KEEP SWIPING UP AND DOWN. THIS FIXES IT, HOWEVER THE FIRST TIME I FIXED IT I SWITCHED MY PHONE OFF TO SEE IF IT WOULD STILL WOKR BUT IT WOULDNT AND I HAD TO FIX IT ALL OVER AGAIN. WHAT ISGOING ON",

Right after I take the pic, if I immediately open it, I can see it literally change from how I saw it in the camera, to whatever green tinged, faded BS Apple decides to turn it into. The difference may be small to some of you but it literally drives me insane and it's worse with some photos than others. Some I can edit it out, others it's literally impossible. \n\nHave any of y'all noticed this?? How can I make this stop happening?? I've tweaked all the settings, tried with RAW on/off, all of it. ",

I purchased the screen protector and a case directly from the Flolab website. The case still hasn‚Äôt shipped from china, but I‚Äôm optimistic that it‚Äôll arrive within the next 5 days. \n\nAnyways, after worrying about the fitment, quality, light bleed reviews I‚Äôve read from posts, I finally applied the glass and must say I‚Äôm genially impressed and even shocked a little. The quality is next to none. The AR coating does wonders, and the clarity is insane compared to my DBrand & Torras glass. I will say the Torras quality is as good as Flolab, but the reflections are more noticeable on the Torras. \n\nthe fitment with the Flolab and everything is amazing as well. In the pictures you can see the light not being as pronounced as you would with another brand protector, as well as the non-existent light bleed. I just hope my case doesn‚Äôt get lost or stuck in customs like I‚Äôve read from other posts with Flolab. ",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n‚Äã\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "selftext": "Hello, I'm new here and I hope this is following post rules. After recent developments with the future of Android as an OS, I'm considering switching to iPhone when the time to upgrade comes. I'm already on Mac, so I guess entering the ecosystem makes sense. \n\nAs the tag specifies, I'm hoping moreso to start a discussion than just ask a question. Sure, yes. I love how open the Android OS has been. I love being in control of my files, doing whatever I want with it, and not having to deal with iOS's walled garden. I have never had an iPhone, but I did have an iPod Touch fourth generation a decade ago, and I set up my grandma's iPad for her. My experience with it is limited, but I think I get the gist.\n\nThe main reason I'm even considering this decision stems from just not needing the capabilities of a computer in my pocket as much, anymore. I realize iPhones are very solid and do what they do well. Regardless of my opinions on Apple the company, they typically seem to deliver on their products. What do you do with your iPhone, just running apps and web browsing? Do you still put your own music files on yours and sync it from the Apple Music Mac app, or do you just use the subscription? Artists, do you use yours for art, or did you shell out for an iPad and the Apple Pencil? \n\nHopefully we can just have a civil discussion without tearing down one platform or another.\n\nTLDR: I may upgrade to iPhone in the future, hoping for discussions on why you prefer your iPhone to Android, if you've used it previously.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I'm new here and I hope this is following post rules. After recent developments with the future of Android as an OS, I'm considering switching to iPhone when the time to upgrade comes. I'm already on Mac, so I guess entering the ecosystem makes sense. \n\nAs the tag specifies, I'm hoping moreso to start a discussion than just ask a question. Sure, yes. I love how open the Android OS has been. I love being in control of my files, doing whatever I want with it, and not having to deal with iOS's walled garden. I have never had an iPhone, but I did have an iPod Touch fourth generation a decade ago, and I set up my grandma's iPad for her. My experience with it is limited, but I think I get the gist.\n\nThe main reason I'm even considering this decision stems from just not needing the capabilities of a computer in my pocket as much, anymore. I realize iPhones are very solid and do what they do well. Regardless of my opinions on Apple the company, they typically seem to deliver on their products. What do you do with your iPhone, just running apps and web browsing? Do you still put your own music files on yours and sync it from the Apple Music Mac app, or do you just use the subscription? Artists, do you use yours for art, or did you shell out for an iPad and the Apple Pencil? \n\nHopefully we can just have a civil discussion without tearing down one platform or another.\n\nTLDR: I may upgrade to iPhone in the future, hoping for discussions on why you prefer your iPhone to Android, if you've used it previously.",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Alert: Feature creates Severe Vulnerability",
    "selftext": "Recently, I received a text from Android that during an update a new feature was automatically enabled. This feature is called Smart Wi-Fi and on the surface it seems like a great idea that will ensure you are always connected to Wi-Fi instead of using your Mobile Data. However, this feature is also enabled automatically (and this is important), which is one of the roots of the problem.\n\nBefore continuing, I should point out that I've been in IT for over 23 years, 12 of which were specializing in Cybersecurity and I currently hold both the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker through EC Council) as well as my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional through Offensive Security which is also an Ethical Hacker certification). With that out of the way, please allow me to explain what the vulnerability is and how it affects everyone that uses it.\n\nThe Smart Wi-Fi feature attempts to work much like Mesh Networking which is to say, you stay connected to a Wi-Fi network internet enabled device without interruption so the switch is seamless and instant, and it stays connected to the most powerful network detected, ensuring the strongest connection. This feature operates much like how Cisco and Ubiquity Unifi's Mesh networking works.\n\nThe big difference however is with Cisco and Unifi Mesh networking (and other similar mesh networking) you rely on multiple devices connected to the SAME network, thus you don't change networks but rather you stay connected to the closes device on the network you're attached to ensuring the best connection signal even when roaming around.\n\nWith me so far? Great! Now let's discuss the vulnerability.\n\nUnlike Mesh Networking as mentioned above, Smart Wi-Fi attempts to remain connected to Wi-Fi devices. It does state Known networks but in testing, I was able to connect to my rogue Wi-Fi network automatically despite not being in my known network list and the why is simple.\n\nThere's a technique known as Man-In-The-Middle or MITM for short, which is used by both Red Team (Penetration Testers/Ethical Hackers) as well as Threat Actors. In this process what I would do is set up my rogue Wi-Fi network provider and mimic the SSID of the network I want to compromise. I then leave the password option off and then broadcast the Wi-Fi signal at a stronger strength than what the devices inside the network I want to compromise is. Because of this Smart Wi-Fi feature, those with this SSID saved have a good chance of automatically connecting to my rogue Wi-Fi device and since I provide internet through it, they aren't the wiser. This happens as soon as the device they're connected to becomes weaker than mine. Once this happens, I may push a prompt that asks the user to reenter their Wi-Fi credentials, and if successful I just compromised the target networks security, bypassing it completely.\n\nHome owners will likely not have much to worry about as Threat Actors don't typically attempt to attack home networks - it's really a waste of time and effort with little to gain. However, government and businesses are prime targets.\n\nThe solution is to disable the option that is automatically enabled which allows your Android phone to connect to the strongest Known network. The risk isn't in connecting to known networks, but rather the automatic switching of networks which enables the use of SSID Spoofing and MITM attacks.\n\nI hope this does some of you good and hopefully Android's team will also see this and have this feature disabled by default instead of enabled. That way if people want to take the risk they can instead of being unaware of the risk in the first place.",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line.

The authorized service centre‚Äôs report clearly mentioned ‚ÄúDisplay ‚Äì step mark on display.‚Äù\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called ‚Äúflagship quality‚Äù completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care ‚Äî never dropped, always in Samsung‚Äôs original case and protector ‚Äî yet the display failed twice.

    "title": "Cybersecurity Alert: Feature creates Severe Vulnerability",
    "selftext": "Recently, I received a text from Android that during an update a new feature was automatically enabled. This feature is called Smart Wi-Fi and on the surface it seems like a great idea that will ensure you are always connected to Wi-Fi instead of using your Mobile Data. However, this feature is also enabled automatically (and this is important), which is one of the roots of the problem.\n\nBefore continuing, I should point out that I've been in IT for over 23 years, 12 of which were specializing in Cybersecurity and I currently hold both the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker through EC Council) as well as my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional through Offensive Security which is also an Ethical Hacker certification). With that out of the way, please allow me to explain what the vulnerability is and how it affects everyone that uses it.\n\nThe Smart Wi-Fi feature attempts to work much like Mesh Networking which is to say, you stay connected to a Wi-Fi network internet enabled device without interruption so the switch is seamless and instant, and it stays connected to the most powerful network detected, ensuring the strongest connection. This feature operates much like how Cisco and Ubiquity Unifi's Mesh networking works.\n\nThe big difference however is with Cisco and Unifi Mesh networking (and other similar mesh networking) you rely on multiple devices connected to the SAME network, thus you don't change networks but rather you stay connected to the closes device on the network you're attached to ensuring the best connection signal even when roaming around.\n\nWith me so far? Great! Now let's discuss the vulnerability.\n\nUnlike Mesh Networking as mentioned above, Smart Wi-Fi attempts to remain connected to Wi-Fi devices. It does state Known networks but in testing, I was able to connect to my rogue Wi-Fi network automatically despite not being in my known network list and the why is simple.\n\nThere's a technique known as Man-In-The-Middle or MITM for short, which is used by both Red Team (Penetration Testers/Ethical Hackers) as well as Threat Actors. In this process what I would do is set up my rogue Wi-Fi network provider and mimic the SSID of the network I want to compromise. I then leave the password option off and then broadcast the Wi-Fi signal at a stronger strength than what the devices inside the network I want to compromise is. Because of this Smart Wi-Fi feature, those with this SSID saved have a good chance of automatically connecting to my rogue Wi-Fi device and since I provide internet through it, they aren't the wiser. This happens as soon as the device they're connected to becomes weaker than mine. Once this happens, I may push a prompt that asks the user to reenter their Wi-Fi credentials, and if successful I just compromised the target networks security, bypassing it completely.\n\nHome owners will likely not have much to worry about as Threat Actors don't typically attempt to attack home networks - it's really a waste of time and effort with little to gain. However, government and businesses are prime targets.\n\nThe solution is to disable the option that is automatically enabled which allows your Android phone to connect to the strongest Known network. The risk isn't in connecting to known networks, but rather the automatic switching of networks which enables the use of SSID Spoofing and MITM attacks.\n\nI hope this does some of you good and hopefully Android's team will also see this and have this feature disabled by default instead of enabled. That way if people want to take the risk they can instead of being unaware of the risk in the first place.",

The lifted pattern is exactly the same everytime and I can't see it being anything else.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/z5ZM4S7Dd3EqmGiH9\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue?\n\n\n",

Instead it's using what it refers to as \"Aurora\" which is a \"default British female\" the issue is, it sounds condescending and rude constantly and the cadence and tone it uses is practically sarcastic and abrasive. The voice (Ursa in my case) still works when you just ask a normal question by holding the power button on the Pixel phone, but in \"Live\" mode it's this new voice and I couldn't hate it any more than do now. Switching to a male voice doesn't fix the issue either, you end up with whoever you pick in the version of Gemini you summon with a button, but the live version is \"default British male\" same abrasive tone and same condescending speech. I don't know if this is a big, or Google us doing some social experiment, but can someone please help me fix this, genuinely finding it completely unusable currently and I've searched online for an answer already but I haven't found any solution or even an acknowledgement from Google that they're aware of the issue, but others do seem to have this issue too.",

It will charge your phone once but then you will need to unplug it from the wall to make it work again. So if you charge your phone overnight it'll hit full battery (or 80%) and then start depleting from them because it won't turn on again. It is a real pity because it's competitively priced and really reanic nice.\nSo yeah, if you have a Pixel 10 buy something else.",

I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced the same issue.\n\nI've been a Pixel user since the good old days of the Pixel 3 XL, and the phone was working fine most of the time. The next Pixel I got was the Pixel 8 Pro, then the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and now I've got my shiny new Pixel 10 Pro XL.\n\nI will have to go on business trips to Chinese Mainland from time to time. Actually I am here for the Canton Fair right now.\n\n\nHere's the problem:\n\nThe phone has VoLTE and VoNR support in Hong Kong SAR with a local SIM from 3HK or roaming with my TWM SIM.\n\nPixels can connect to LTE for Internet access, but without VoLTE and VoNR support in Chinese Mainland with both my local SIMs from China Mobile and China Telecom.\n\nInterestingly, my Galaxy works well here and has NR SA connected with VoNR support when a local SIM was inserted.\n\n\nI reached Google Support in November last year and kept sending them bug reports until February this year, only to get an answer that was kind of like \"thanks for notifying us.\"\n\nAlso, I have posted to the Pixel Community about this frustrating issue, and they said that they can offer nothing since Google doesn't monitor the community.\n\nHas anyone else got the same issue? Pixel phones are really nice, and I wish I could use them everywhere rather than swapping my SIMs with my Galaxy frequently on business trips.",

I can use my cameras freely in the camera app itself, but any social media or chat app with a camera freezes if my eye gets too close to the front camera. This doesn't even make sense?? Why the eye? If I try to take a picture of my nose really close, the picture will not freeze. It will also not freeze if I try to put any other object near the front camera. Only eye or eyes up close make it freeze/crash. I tried this on a picture of a human on a maganize, and it didn't work even though I put the camera really close to the person's face. It only works if it's my face/eye, doesn't work on flat pictures.\n\nI tried updating my phone, the camera app, the social media apps, I restarted my phone many times, cleared cache, everything.

    "title": "Some games aren't working on a brand new P7 Pro. + My weeklong journey with the Pixel so far.",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: Got a brand-new and (until yesterday) factory sealed Pixel 7 Pro, three games either hang or crash immediately, despite working fine on my previous Pixel. Everything else on the phone runs perfectly afaik.\n\nEdit: I didn't really want to go through the hassle of a factory reset it DID seem to just fix these issues for me. OSRS and NIKKE both launch and run just fine now. Unlike the first time I didn't import any data from my old phone or restore any backups.\n\nThis is mostly me asking for help but I've had a bit of a journey over the last week and I might ramble a little bit before I get to my actual issue. I'm a week and two devices into my journey with the Pixel 7 Pro now, easily the most expensive phone I've ever owned and huge upgrade from my old Galaxy A50.\n\nAlmost two weeks ago I bought an 'acceptable quality' refurbished Pixel 7 Pro on Amazon for ¬£210. It arrived last Wednesday and despite a slight bit of cosmetic damage and a few minor scratches on the screen that weren't even visible when the screen was on was fairly chuffed with it, I'd spent a bit of time playing around with it's camera and all the other little features that came with it, and got to setting everything up until barely 3 hours after swiching it on when it suddenly just switched itself off at around  what should've been 65%-70% battery and refused to turn back on again, only when plugged into the wall would it power on but after barely a second on the splash screen it would immediately shut off again and just keep bootlopping from there i did manage to get into the bootloader/fastboot menu but no further from there.\n\nAbout a day later it just suddenly started working again, and I'd managed (with some power button/volume spamming, I don't even remember how) to get it into some 'no command' screen and then into android itself. I had already contacted the seller yesterday to tell them it had suddenly stopped functioning so I messaged again to update them, of course my issues didn't stop there, at random points it would once again just turn off, though unlike the first time I was able to just turn it back on again. I was incredibly suspicious of the reseller anyway as they included an M360 diagnostic report that [showed 100% battery health despite their own diagnostic report showing it had been through 1050 battery cycle](https://imgur.com/a/czQaFiS)s.\n\nBy Saturday evening I'd had enough after it did it TWICE in the span of 20 minutes at work so I got home, factory wiped it and informed the seller of my intent to return it and went shopping around for another phone, I did 'really' like the Pixel 7 from the bit of time I had with it so I went around looking at the newer Pixels and on Monday I found an Ebay listing for a brand new and sealed Pixel 7 Pro for only ¬£300 so instead I dived on that. \n\n\nIt arrived yesterday and after and after confirming it was indeed brand new and factory sealed, I let it charge to full for a few hours since it was entirely dead before switching it on for the first time, spent a bit of time getting everything setup again and updating the firmware from it's factory version of Android 13 to 16, great, everything working, I'm quite happy until try to launch a couple of the games to get them setup and properly downloaded.\n\n\n\n\n**Now my ACTUAL issue.**\n\nThree of the four games I usually have installed: Old School Runescape, Nikke and Rome Total War, all of which worked on the previous refurbed Pixel refuse to work on the new one. I'm fairly certain it's not the games themselves and I don't have a clue on why it would be the phone itself. The new phone has been fully updated and as far as I'm aware were/are both on the 1st October patch that the one I returned was on.\n\nI don't generally game on mobile so the game I do play are usually just ones I play on PC anyway and have cross-progression. If only one of them was having issues I'd just brush it off but three of the four I tested is a bit more worrisome.\n\n\n**Old School Runescape:** Will either hang on a black screen when launched before popping up a 'not responding' error or it'll simply show the app icon on said black screen and nothing more.\n\n**NIKKE:** Will get to it's load screen but stop loading at step 5/7 at exactly 57% won't progress any further.\n\n**Rome Total War:** Will launch but on the screen where it requires you to acknowledge it needs a periodic internet connection to work, tapping accept will force-close/crash the game back to homescreen.\n\n\n**Umamusume** on the other hand DOES work, I was able to get that working just fine, as far as the game's lobby screen without any issues.\n\n\nAnyone having any similar issues, problems or any possible fixes? I've tried the usual troubleshooting steps, reinstalling the apps, clearing cache/data for both the games and Google Play services, rebooting the phone but zero luck so far. Short of a factory wipe and doing all the setup again I'm not entirely certain where to go from here. I did a bit of Googling and found that last months Android update *might* be causing issues for some people across multiple different Pixel models.",

I thought changing carriers might help, but it made no difference. \n\nAnyway, recently there have been two incidents where I've needed to call 000 and my phone **can't connectivity to emergency services** because of this bug. \n\nIn Australia (and I assume most countries) your phone will select ANY available phone network it can in order to get through.

I could not figure out what to do so I restarted and my phone was working fine after that. \n\nFast forward a few hours and I am using maps again same issue. The screen in my car says couldn't connect to maps or whatever it said maps would not open on my phone and the home screen was not responding to touch although I could swipe down from the top or swipe up from the bottom just fine. I tried force closing maps but that did not work the only thing I can figure out to fix it was a reboot.\n\nPreviously I mentioned that out of nowhere the background would pop up and that was the only thing on screen no icons or nothing. I have the same brand case that I had for the other phone. Google is telling me they may have manufactured the case a little off and the edges of the case are touching the screen. Randomly my background will just pop up out of nowhere out of focus sometimes (blurry) with no icons or nothing else on the screen. I thought it was me pressing something by accident but I can't recreate it it just randomly happens. \n\n",

However, I can't do that anymore?\n\nApparently the reps I have talked to said there's no repair history for my P9P, makes sense, but because I cancelled my first repair request (I forgot to pick prepaid shipping box from google) and made another request, each one was for my 3a. Because of the multiple submissions? (Just the 2) It's causing me to error on any future repair requests somehow? Whenever I have clicked to start a repair for my P9P it just gives me \"A repair order already exists for this device. If you have questions,¬†contact us.\" \n\nWhat's weirder is when you click on the contact us from that quote, any chat sessions you request goes into a \"death loop\" meaning if I were to refresh and try to request a chat session on the computer, it'll say chat session is closed. The workaround is going to the bottom of the page and clicking that \"contact us\" link for a proper chat session to load. \n\nHas anyone ever experience this repair request wall? So far 2 reps who suggested logging out/in didn't work, and their attempts to clear that 3a cancellation repair request has yet to clear off. How is there store page that bad to do even basic repair requests??",

    "selftext": "I have a Pixel 9 Pro XL.  At some point within the last week or two I started having a problem either in my photos or my files apps.  Whenever I screenshot something, it does not appear in my gallery and when I go to my screenshots folder in the Photos app or try to open the images folder in the Files app, the app essentially freezes up.  (Similarly, this happens when I attempt to download pictures as well.)  I first noticed this when I took a screenshot and went to send it on Discord and the picture had a blank thumbnail.  When I clicked the thumbnail, my Discord got to the point where I had to force close it to get it functioning correctly again.  I'm at the point where if I forget and accidentally download or screenshot something, I have to restart my phone to access any pictures on my phone.  I'm kinda stumped and was wondering if anyone's had a similar problem or might have some solution or troubleshooting I can do.  Thanks a lot!",

    "selftext": "The past few months, my Pixel 8 has randomly flickered green. Sometimes it's only a little greenish tint, sometimes it renders my phone unusable because the screen looks like green static. Through Reddit, I discovered that a gentle squeeze on the bottom of the phone would (sometimes) fix the issue, albeit temporarily. I didn't really want to continue this practice and potentially damage the phone.\n\nTwo nights ago, it was flickering, but wouldn't go back with a gentle squeeze. I put it on its charger and in the morning, it was fine, no more green. However, now there is a neon vertical line off-center to the right side of the screen that extends from the top to the bottom and does not go away. \n\nI contacted customer service yesterday and they told me that, if I could send them the invoice for the phone purchase, we could go over potential options (they told me that based on purchase date, it was out of warranty). I was at work and didn't have this proof of purchase on me, but they said I could send them the invoice at any point in the next 24 hours. I went to the local AT&T store and retrieved the invoice for the phone, then sent it along in the support chat. \n\nAt this point, the person (or bot) I was chatting with had changed names. After sending the receipt, I was informed that my only options were to either mail it to them or take it to a UBreakIFix location that was out-of-state and inconvenient for travel. I asked why they had me retrieve the invoice, and got different answers from multiple reps, including a supervisor. I believe that, ultimately, it was not necessary.\n\nHas anyone else had to jump through hoops to have this issue fixed? \n\nI'm kind of annoyed that the onus of repair is put entirely on the customer when Google is aware of this problem, which was created on their end.

I have not seen even cheap Chinese Phones with Sub INR 10k swelling up suddenly within 2 years as with this shit Pixel 7.

So my concerns are :- 1) Will it now expand till the whole screen becomes just white or this is it . 2) will service centre guys let me exercise it's warranty or they'll just claim it happened when the phone fell and that dent was created..It sucks cuz I'm only a student and it's merely 8months old but that's about it .

The lifted pattern is exactly the same everytime and I can't see it being anything else.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/z5ZM4S7Dd3EqmGiH9\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue?\n\n\n",

    "title": "I got the OFFICIAL Camera Update (10.1.076.821848723.18). The Verdict: THE STUTTER IS NOT FIXED.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis has been a wild ride. Today, **I finally received the official Google Camera update (v. 10.1.076.821848723.18) directly from the Play Store**.\n\nTo give you the full context:\n\n* **Oct 11th:** Google Support first told me the fix was in the (then unreleased) Oct 9th build **(10.1.076.816441313.17)**. I told them I'd test it when I received it.\n* **Oct 16th:** I experienced that bizarre \"[miracle fix](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)\" anomaly. I wrote to them again with proof, asking what was going on, and reiterated that I *still* hadn't received the update and that the manual APK *did not* work.\n* **Oct 17th:** Support replied, saying they were escalating this new 'miracle fix' info to the engineers.\n* **Oct 28th (Yesterday):** After 11 days of silence, I wrote to them again for an update. They replied, stating they were *also* still waiting for a follow-up from the engineers.\n* **Oct 29th (Today):** And then, this morning, the update finally, *officially* arrived.\n\nI immediately went to my testing spot, and unfortunately, I have to be the bearer of bad news.\n\n**The verdict: The main EIS stutter bug on the telephoto lens is 100% still there. It is NOT fixed.**\n\nYou can watch the full, new video evidence I just uploaded here: [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s)\n\n# What the Video Proves\n\nThe new test footage confirms the 5X Telephoto is still unusable (you can see the comparison with our benchmark, **OpenCamera**).\n\nIn addition to the obvious OIS/EIS conflict, I still **hypothesize that the root cause is a software limbo**: the telephoto's stabilization seems permanently stuck somewhere between the 'Standard' and 'Lock' modes. It tries to 'stick' to objects even when it shouldn't, which is what causes the 'jump' or 'stutter' when you pan. My [**new video**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s?t=22) clearly demonstrates the broken toggle.\n\n# The (Only) Good News\n\nThe *only* positive thing is that the October updates (both this one and the last one) **unlocked the ProRes 50MP feature**. (A heads-up for those who didn't know!) This now enables **100x zoom** in 50MP mode, up from the old 30x limit, and the quality is noticeably better. This is honestly how it should have worked from the start, but it's a nice find.\n\n*(P.S. This new \"failed fix\" also doesn't explain the bizarre \"miracle fix\" I experienced on* ***October 16th****, which I captured on video here:* [***ProShot and PixeCamera***](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)*. That was a separate anomaly that disappeared after a reboot.)*\n\n# I Need Your Help: A Call for Data\n\nHere's where it gets confusing. I know some users, like u/Unbreakable2k8, [reported that the APK did fix the issue for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nojbce/comment/nl41b16/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This is why I need to ask the community for help so we can gather proper statistics.\n\n**If you have a Pixel Pro/Pro XL (10, 9, 8, 7, 6) and received the OFFICIAL 10.1.076.816441313.17** or **10.1.076.821848723.18 update:**\n\n1. **What phone do you have?**\n2. **Did you get the update from the Play Store?**\n3. **Is the EIS telephoto stutter fixed for YOU?**\n\nPlease let me know in the comments. I will be compiling all of my **7 new logs** from today's failed test, my new video evidence, AND a summary of our community findings into a new, massive report for Google.\n\n**We're not giving up. Thanks, everyone.ü§ù**",

The voice (Ursa in my case) still works when you just ask a normal question by holding the power button on the Pixel phone, but in \"Live\" mode it's this new voice and I couldn't hate it any more than do now. Switching to a male voice doesn't fix the issue either, you end up with whoever you pick in the version of Gemini you summon with a button, but the live version is \"default British male\" same abrasive tone and same condescending speech. I don't know if this is a big, or Google us doing some social experiment, but can someone please help me fix this, genuinely finding it completely unusable currently and I've searched online for an answer already but I haven't found any solution or even an acknowledgement from Google that they're aware of the issue, but others do seem to have this issue too.",

She told me just to hang up and call 911 right now. I did that, the same dispatcher picked up. I told her it's me again, thanks for letting me test it. She said, no problem and hung up. \n\nI think if you're very concerned about this potential issue, just call the non emergency number for your city and explain it to them. The dispatcher is more than happy to help.\n\nYou will get a prompt after you hang up that says your phone is open for emergency callback for 5 minutes.

Nothing else happened so i considered myself fortunate.. but yesterday very randomly I got  a bright white line on my left side of the screen... So my concerns are :- 1) Will it now expand till the whole screen becomes just white or this is it . 2) will service centre guys let me exercise it's warranty or they'll just claim it happened when the phone fell and that dent was created..It sucks cuz I'm only a student and it's merely 8months old but that's about it . Does anyone has a similar experience. \nI'm unable to attach a picture idk why ",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I‚Äôm absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I‚Äôm there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this sound bar isn‚Äôt quite on the same level as my old system was, but it‚Äôs probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "to make a long story short, i work at a computer repair shop, and we often have people come in with cellphones, which we almost always direct over to the local cellphone repair shop. we have an agreement that if we get a cellphone repair request we send them to their shop, and if they get a laptop repair request they send them to our shop\n\nbut with the issues where people are having with samsung galaxy ring batteries swelling, im not sure if i should send them to the cellphone repair shop, or the hospital.\n\nthis isnt a joke meme post, ive just heard that hospitals have a hard time removing the rings because of the nature of the battery in the ring meaning the ring cant just be cut off in the normal way they would a stuck ring, so im really not sure what to do in that situation\n\ni dont have anything much aganst samsung, asside from the annoyance of apps with the appliances my landlord has recently installed in our apartment (im not a fan of needing an app to access all the features of my stove) cause samsung phones are not bad, not the best option in my opinion but if you have the money to spend they are the apple of the android world and so i get it.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I‚Äôve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

BTW you cannot set up kids mode without a Samsung phone... And even then the process sucks. \nThe connectivity has been spotty AF, even outside and we live in Northern Chicago area with excellent coverage. \nThe last straw was when the 8yo accidentally left their watch at school but wasn't sure exactly when/where it might be. And the Find Hub placed it repeatedly at a coffee shop over a mile away. Leading us to believe it has been taken away from school by another child (not necessarily theft per semester). \n\nIt turned out to have stayed at school. \n\nLocation tracking that repeatedly updates to a place over a mile away is not acceptable for something explicitly intended to help parents have a modicum of ability to know where their kids might be in the event of an urgent situation or simply to check  in on their travels on public transit. \n\n[Edit] and it wouldn't be acceptable for an adult away from their phone either.

    "selftext": "Hello guys!   \nI know there's a lot of those topics, but it seems that my case is a bit different.   \n  \nSo this January I bought brand new GW5pro  (manufactured at the end of 2023)  from a local chain - updated it to the latest firmware  at the time and used it happily, getting at least 60h of battery life (72 in better days)  with no restrictions, using it like a smart watch - bunch of notifications, constant pulse tracking, GPS activities like running or bicycle, gym exercise tracking, sleep tracking. I used mostly stock apps and watch faces, aside from Spotify maybe. \n\nThen, at the end of September at some point it died on me unexpectedly - clocking in less than 24h from full charge, and battery never got as good as before ever since. \n\nI did all the obvious stuff - cleared cache, done a reset, updated and reinstalled everything, set it up from scratch without restoring backup.  Since it's still under warranty - I reached to the Samsung service, 3 times in total. First they diagnosed it and done a full reset - issue remained. Then I returned it to the store, they sent it to the same Service Center, for them to do another reset, with no result. \n\nThen I reached out to local Samsung support, and they advised to take it back to the service once more - then, when service diagnosed it yet again ('no issues found') - I pressed with my story, and as a part of keeping me loyal, they changes the watch battery and a back plate, returning it to me with stock firmware (one ui 4.5) - I updated it again, and guess what? The watch barely hangs for 30hours from charge to charge. \n\nNothing has changes in my use patterns, no 3rd party apps (aside from Spotify occasionally) were draining battery. My phone (s24U) is doing perfectly fine while the watch does this BS. \n\n*TLDR: Bought a new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro with great battery life (60-72 hours). In September, it suddenly dropped to under 24 hours. Despite multiple resets and a warranty repair where Samsung replaced the battery, the problem persists, now lasting only about 30 hours. No changes in usage patterns.*\n\nThank you for everyone who got this through.  Any ideas on how to fix this? Maybe someone had similar issues? ",

Like, I cannot spin with one finger like I did my old watch. I HAVE to use 2 or 3 fingers and press down a little (insert joke here). My question is, is that normal? Do I need to just wear it loose or is it a defect with the watch and I need to get a replacement?

But I'm not reading very good things about the battery.\n\nI am mostly interested in health (ecg, sleep) and sports (mainly pool and open water swimming and running, 4-5 times a week) tracking. I already have had several smart watches and never used calling/messaging etc and never used AOD.\n\nMy question is, is there someone out there using the watch like this, more like a Garmin let's say (which I don't consider as an option because I don't like the designs and they're way more expensive here than W8)? What kind of battery life can I expect?\n\nAs I'm using a Huawei, which I charge like every 10 days or so I guess, charging daily would be a nightmare!\n\nThanks in advance..",

However when I did this, I found that I could no longer download any apps onto the watch. Whenever I go into the Galaxy Store on the watch, it just doesn't display any app results whatsoever- I click the recommended tab, 'no results'. I search for a specific app, 'no results'. Watch faces still appear when searched and can be downloaded, but no apps. I looked online, saw a tip to restart both devices, which I did to no help. Then another tip to factory reset the watch and connect it again, which again I did and it didn't help. I understand the watch is old but its worked absolutely fine connected to my old A54, so what changed? If anyone has the solution to this problem it would be appreciated. \n\nP.s. sorry the screenshots are in Polish, but it just essentially says 'no results' as I stated above.",

Now four weeks out I'm above 50%.  Charging times have been correspondingly reduced.  The only change I can think of is being totally dissatisfied with Samsung Health exporting data I've limited what it exports, but it's still exporting heart rate 24/7, and I think that gets sent to the phone even without using Samsung Health at all.\n\nHave others notice similar significant changes in battery drain?\n\nEdit:  I should have knocked wood after posting. Today it was down to 18% which hasn't happened since the first week.  No unusual uses yesterday.",

    "selftext": "I've had my Watch 5 since September 2022, so 3 years which is pretty good, but latrly the battery life just hasn't been working. I am now charging it daily, but I might have to bump that to twice a day.\n\nToday, I charged my watch to 100%, put it on, unlocked it and then went about my day, I dont use my watch that often so imagine my surprise when I get in bed, 8 hours later, after having power saver on all day, that my watch is at 1%, and that only 0.5% of the battery was used by OneUI home, the rest just disappeared.\n\nAny ideas, other than pure watch age, that this might be happening? Its really rather frustrating.",

    "selftext": "The battery on my og galaxy watch has finally given up so looking to upgrade, and unfortunately the 44mm is too big in on my wrist. (Samsung why get rid of the 42mm classic??? Thats exactly what I want.)\n\nI've seen a lot varying opinions on the battery life but its pretty much all from right after release, so hoping to see what its like after some updates and time to optimise. \n\nIdeally I want at least at day of battery whilst using all the bells and whilstles (edit: except LTE), so that in a couple years when the battery degrades I can only need to charge it overnight. Is the 40mm capable of that or do I need to lower my expectations?",

I am a public speaker and use the timer to stick to my time and I have perfected deceptively peaking at my watch without the audience seeing. But if it's damn near microscopic I cannot and it's really annoying on stage. Last time I had to pretend I was checking my steps in order to see what time I'm at. Does anybody know how I can set it to the old way where it takes up the whole screen? It also does this for the timer, which is also annoying when I'm at the gym and it minimizes it when I'm doing 1 minute reps. But that's not as essential. I have googled other reddit posts but they're all old/out dated/have instructions to options that no longer exist. I'd really appreciate some help. Thank you! ",

    "selftext": "Hello guys!   \nI know there's a lot of those topics, but it seems that my case is a bit different.   \n  \nSo this January I bought brand new GW5pro  (manufactured at the end of 2023)  from a local chain - updated it to the latest firmware  at the time and used it happily, getting at least 60h of battery life (72 in better days)  with no restrictions, using it like a smart watch - bunch of notifications, constant pulse tracking, GPS activities like running or bicycle, gym exercise tracking, sleep tracking. I used mostly stock apps and watch faces, aside from Spotify maybe. \n\nThen, at the end of September at some point it died on me unexpectedly - clocking in less than 24h from full charge, and battery never got as good as before ever since. \n\nI did all the obvious stuff - cleared cache, done a reset, updated and reinstalled everything, set it up from scratch without restoring backup.  Since it's still under warranty - I reached to the Samsung service, 3 times in total. First they diagnosed it and done a full reset - issue remained. Then I returned it to the store, they sent it to the same Service Center, for them to do another reset, with no result. \n\nThen I reached out to local Samsung support, and they advised to take it back to the service once more - then, when service diagnosed it yet again ('no issues found') - I pressed with my story, and as a part of keeping me loyal, they changes the watch battery and a back plate, returning it to me with stock firmware (one ui 4.5) - I updated it again, and guess what? The watch barely hangs for 30hours from charge to charge. \n\nNothing has changes in my use patterns, no 3rd party apps (aside from Spotify occasionally) were draining battery. My phone (s24U) is doing perfectly fine while the watch does this BS. \n\n*TLDR: Bought a new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro with great battery life (60-72 hours). In September, it suddenly dropped to under 24 hours. Despite multiple resets and a warranty repair where Samsung replaced the battery, the problem persists, now lasting only about 30 hours. No changes in usage patterns.*\n\nThank you for everyone who got this through.  Any ideas on how to fix this? Maybe someone had similar issues? ",

I had to get a new watch because something shredded under my bezel and everytime I'd spin it, something black or clear would work it's way from under the bezel. I'd had it for like 2ish years so I def got my money's worth and I def put a ton of miles on that little bezel, so I'm not surprised. I ordered a Watch 6 Classic (love that bezel, baby!) refurbished from Amazon, just like I did with my Watch 4. \n\nMy concern: I tried to spin the bezel on the Watch 6 Classic and it is significantly tighter. Like, I cannot spin with one finger like I did my old watch. I HAVE to use 2 or 3 fingers and press down a little (insert joke here). My question is, is that normal? Do I need to just wear it loose or is it a defect with the watch and I need to get a replacement? Is the too-tight a feature or a bug? \n\nTL;DR: Watch 6 Classic bezel is tighter than my wife, do I need a new one? ",

However, upon seeing it in person, I thought it was too bulky for me and my usage profile.\n\nSo even if the design is less attractive (for me obviously), I'm now considering Watch 8 (non LTE version). But I'm not reading very good things about the battery.\n\nI am mostly interested in health (ecg, sleep) and sports (mainly pool and open water swimming and running, 4-5 times a week) tracking. I already have had several smart watches and never used calling/messaging etc and never used AOD.\n\nMy question is, is there someone out there using the watch like this, more like a Garmin let's say (which I don't consider as an option because I don't like the designs and they're way more expensive here than W8)? What kind of battery life can I expect?\n\nAs I'm using a Huawei, which I charge like every 10 days or so I guess, charging daily would be a nightmare!\n\nThanks in advance..",

I have all permissions allowed on both phone and watch. For some reason the Galaxy wearable app has notifications turned off and I'm unable to turn them on. I've tried restarting both phone and watch. Even deleted the app. I've included images of what I'm seeing. I also accidentally removed permission on my one plus 13 phone for the Galaxy wearable app for device app and notification, but I can't find any way to give it permission back. Any help is appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Trying to setup up the Galaxy Watch 7 with my moto razr. The watch is connected, the Galaxy Wearables app is working fine, the Samsung Health app also shows the watch is connected, but just cannot sync data over.  \n\nThe problem appears to be two-way: the Samsung Health app cannot retrieve data from the watch; the watch also cannot open the app on the phone. For example, if I open the heart rate app on the watch and scroll to the bottom and click the ‚Äúshow on phone‚Äù button, it gives an error saying ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt open Samsung health on phone‚Äù with a question mark next to the Bluetooth icon in the middle of watch icon and phone icon- however the Bluetooth is definitely connected. \n\nTried all the different suggestions online, clear  cache / data for the app, reset the watch and reconnect, update all the softwares and firmwares, sync to Samsung account, etc. None of them worked. \n\nAny thoughts what could be wrong and how to fix it? Quite frustrating for not being able to make such a basic function to work. Thanks. ",

This post isn't for you. \nBut if you weren't aware: The Galaxy 8 is marketed to parents as an alternative to the Apple watch for a standalone connected device alternative to a cell phone. \nSearch  \"Galaxy Watch for Kids\" to find their page and the information they are advertising to parents.\n\nEVERY PART of getting Samsung Galaxy watches for our 2 kids as alternatives to cell phones had been one enormous trial after another. \nIt took days to get them set up and working on Verizon. BTW you cannot set up kids mode without a Samsung phone... And even then the process sucks. \nThe connectivity has been spotty AF, even outside and we live in Northern Chicago area with excellent coverage. \nThe last straw was when the 8yo accidentally left their watch at school but wasn't sure exactly when/where it might be. And the Find Hub placed it repeatedly at a coffee shop over a mile away. Leading us to believe it has been taken away from school by another child (not necessarily theft per semester). \n\nIt turned out to have stayed at school. \n\nLocation tracking that repeatedly updates to a place over a mile away is not acceptable for something explicitly intended to help parents have a modicum of ability to know where their kids might be in the event of an urgent situation or simply to check  in on their travels on public transit. \n\n[Edit] and it wouldn't be acceptable for an adult away from their phone either.

    "selftext": "Hello guys!   \nI know there's a lot of those topics, but it seems that my case is a bit different.   \n  \nSo this January I bought brand new GW5pro  (manufactured at the end of 2023)  from a local chain - updated it to the latest firmware  at the time and used it happily, getting at least 60h of battery life (72 in better days)  with no restrictions, using it like a smart watch - bunch of notifications, constant pulse tracking, GPS activities like running or bicycle, gym exercise tracking, sleep tracking. I used mostly stock apps and watch faces, aside from Spotify maybe. \n\nThen, at the end of September at some point it died on me unexpectedly - clocking in less than 24h from full charge, and battery never got as good as before ever since. \n\nI did all the obvious stuff - cleared cache, done a reset, updated and reinstalled everything, set it up from scratch without restoring backup.  Since it's still under warranty - I reached to the Samsung service, 3 times in total. First they diagnosed it and done a full reset - issue remained. Then I returned it to the store, they sent it to the same Service Center, for them to do another reset, with no result. \n\nThen I reached out to local Samsung support, and they advised to take it back to the service once more - then, when service diagnosed it yet again ('no issues found') - I pressed with my story, and as a part of keeping me loyal, they changes the watch battery and a back plate, returning it to me with stock firmware (one ui 4.5) - I updated it again, and guess what? The watch barely hangs for 30hours from charge to charge. \n\nNothing has changes in my use patterns, no 3rd party apps (aside from Spotify occasionally) were draining battery. My phone (s24U) is doing perfectly fine while the watch does this BS. \n\n*TLDR: Bought a new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro with great battery life (60-72 hours). In September, it suddenly dropped to under 24 hours. Despite multiple resets and a warranty repair where Samsung replaced the battery, the problem persists, now lasting only about 30 hours. No changes in usage patterns.*\n\nThank you for everyone who got this through.  Any ideas on how to fix this? Maybe someone had similar issues? ",

Honestly, it feels like someone is mining crypto on it.\n\nAlso, my setup might be part of the problem:\n‚Äì The laptop is connected to a monitor that also charges it.\n‚Äì That monitor is connected to another monitor through RDP.\n‚Äì If I plug my keyboard/mouse dongle into the monitor, the mouse becomes even laggier, so I have to plug it directly into the laptop.\n‚Äì And when the laptop battery is dead and I use it while it‚Äôs charging, everything goes crazy.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm posting this to share what‚Äôs been one of the worst customer experiences I‚Äôve ever had with a so-called ‚Äúpremium brand.‚Äù\nI ordered a customized Lenovo Legion Pro 5 (AMD Ryzen 9 + RTX 5060) for around ‚Çπ1.6 lakh, including 3 years of ADP and extended warranty.\n\n\nüì¶ Timeline of Events:\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 23: Product shipped from overseas and reached India (customs clearance done).\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 26‚Äì27: Tracking on Blue Dart shows ‚ÄúRTO initiated‚Äù (Return to Origin).\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 27: I contacted Blue Dart ‚Äî they said ‚Äúcontact the sender.‚Äù\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 27‚Äì29: I called Lenovo Post-Sales multiple times. They claimed my pincode was not serviceable (funny thing ‚Äî I‚Äôve already received Lenovo mouse & bag to the same address via Blue Dart!).\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 29: Lenovo support said they‚Äôd redirect my laptop to the nearest Blue Dart hub and asked if I could collect it myself. I agreed. They promised it‚Äôll reach in 24‚Äì48 hours.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 30: I visited the hub in person. The staff told me they never received any such shipment ‚Äî it was still stuck in Bangalore.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tI called again ‚Äî new agent said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know where the product is right now.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tThey gave me random excuses like ‚Äútax clearance delay,‚Äù ‚Äúbilling mismatch,‚Äù ‚Äúrisk in high-end product delivery‚Äù, and even told me to ‚Äújust wait.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhen I asked for a clear answer, one Lenovo agent literally said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know if it will be delivered or not.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tAnd when I pressed further, another replied, ‚ÄúWhy are you calling again and again? We‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù\n\n\n\nüò§ The Level of Misinformation:\n\nEvery time I contact Lenovo support, they give a different reason:\n\t‚Ä¢\tPincode not serviceable\n\t‚Ä¢\tHigh-end product, Blue Dart denying delivery\n\t‚Ä¢\tCustoms/billing issues after clearance\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúSystem updates in progress‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúWait 24‚Äì48 hours‚Äù ‚Äî repeated for 4 days straight\n\nIt‚Äôs been over a week since the product landed in India, and Lenovo India still can‚Äôt tell me where my ‚Çπ1.6 lakh laptop actually is.\n\n\n\nüìû Escalation:\n\nI‚Äôve already:\n\t‚Ä¢\tContacted Lenovo Post-Sale team multiple times.\n\t‚Ä¢\tGot a useless case ID from Madhusudhan K10 (Lenovo India) with zero update.\n\t‚Ä¢\tContacted Blue Dart, who confirmed the item was marked for return and asked me to reach Lenovo.\n\t‚Ä¢\tNow Lenovo claims they are ‚Äúchecking with Blue Dart,‚Äù but no timeline or accountability.\n\n\n\nüí¨ My Questions:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow can a premium brand like Lenovo lose track of a laptop worth ‚Çπ1.6L after it reaches the destination country?\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy does Lenovo support sound like they‚Äôre guessing random reasons each time instead of actually investigating?\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy is there no escalation path beyond helpless call center agents?\n\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è What I Expect:\n\nIf I don‚Äôt receive a clear delivery timeline or refund confirmation within 2‚Äì3 days, I‚Äôll be filing a consumer complaint under the Consumer Protection Act & tagging Lenovo India, Blue Dart, and relevant handles publicly.\n\nThis is beyond frustrating ‚Äî it‚Äôs mentally exhausting to keep chasing something I already paid for in full.\n\n\n\nLenovo India ‚Äî please do better.\nWe don‚Äôt deserve this kind of treatment for being loyal, paying customers.\n\n\n\n(Posting this so others thinking of ordering customized Lenovo laptops in India know what kind of delivery and support nightmare they might face.)",

I figured I‚Äôd open it up here and see what the community thinks.\n\nMy current front-runners\n\nOn the Mac side: the MacBook Air (M4) 15-inch, configured with 24 GB RAM + 1 TB SSD.\n\nPros: macOS ecosystem, great battery life, Apple silicon longevity, light/portable and recently got new iPhone.\n\nCons: Less ideal for gaming (though I don‚Äôt game much now), fewer ports, maybe higher cost for the spec.\n\nOn the Windows side: the Gigabyte AERO X16 - 165Hz 2560x1600 WQXGA - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 - AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370-1TB SSD with 32GB DDR5 RAM.\n\nPros: High specs (strong GPU/CPU), great display, more Windows compatibility.\n\nCons: Potentially heavier, less battery than ultra-light MacBooks, maybe more maintenance/driver stuff.\n\nWhat I‚Äôm looking for\n\nA laptop that lasts 5+ years with solid performance.\n\nGreat for productivity, editing, maybe light creative work ‚Äî gaming is not a priority for me right now, but still considering.\n\nGood value for money.\n\nIf I go Windows, I want something not just ‚Äúgood for games‚Äù but also strong for work/creativity.\n\nIf I go Mac, I want to be sure the spec is right (hence 24 GB RAM + 1TB SSD) so it won‚Äôt feel outdated quickly.\n\nMy questions for you:\n\nFor those using MacBooks: did you go for a high-spec version (24 GB RAM + 1TB+)? Do you feel it was worth the extra cost? How‚Äôs real‚Äêworld battery and portability after \\~1-2 years?\n\nFor those on Windows (especially high-end laptops like AERO X16 or similar): how is the build/thermal/battery situation long-term? Did the GPU/CPU hold up well?\n\nCan anyone suggest alternatives to the MacBook Air (M4) 15‚Ä≥ (24/1TB) that I should consider ‚Äî maybe other Windows ultrabooks or Mac models (14\" Macbook pro m5 base model for example) that hit this ‚Äúpremium but portable + long-life‚Äù sweet spot? \n\nIf you were in my shoes (not a heavy gamer, want longevity + productivity), which side would you lean and why?\n\nThanks in advance ‚Äî any real‚Äêworld experiences/input would be super helpful.",

They claimed my pincode was not serviceable (funny thing ‚Äî I‚Äôve already received Lenovo mouse & bag to the same address via Blue Dart!).\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 29: Lenovo support said they‚Äôd redirect my laptop to the nearest Blue Dart hub and asked if I could collect it myself. I agreed. They promised it‚Äôll reach in 24‚Äì48 hours.\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 30: I visited the hub in person. The staff told me they never received any such shipment ‚Äî it was still stuck in Bangalore.\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 31: I called again ‚Äî new agent said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know where the product is right now.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tThey gave me random excuses like ‚Äútax clearance delay,‚Äù ‚Äúbilling mismatch,‚Äù ‚Äúrisk in high-end product delivery‚Äù, and even told me to ‚Äújust wait.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhen I asked for a clear answer, one Lenovo agent literally said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know if it will be delivered or not.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tAnd when I pressed further, another replied, ‚ÄúWhy are you calling again and again? We‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüò§ The Level of Misinformation:\n\nEvery time I contact Lenovo support, they give a different reason:\n\t‚Ä¢\tPincode not serviceable\n\t‚Ä¢\tHigh-end product, Blue Dart denying delivery\n\t‚Ä¢\tCustoms/billing issues after clearance\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúSystem updates in progress‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúWait 24‚Äì48 hours‚Äù ‚Äî repeated for 4 days straight\n\nIt‚Äôs been over a week since the product landed in India, and Lenovo India still can‚Äôt tell me where my ‚Çπ1.6 lakh laptop actually is.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüìû Escalation:\n\nI‚Äôve already:\n\t‚Ä¢\tContacted Lenovo Post-Sale team multiple times.\n\t‚Ä¢\tGot a useless case ID from Madhusudhan K10 (Lenovo India) with zero update.\n\t‚Ä¢\tContacted Blue Dart, who confirmed the item was marked for return and asked me to reach Lenovo.\n\t‚Ä¢\tNow Lenovo claims they are ‚Äúchecking with Blue Dart,‚Äù but no timeline or accountability.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüí¨ My Questions:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow can a premium brand like Lenovo lose track of a laptop worth ‚Çπ1.6L after it reaches the destination country?\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy does Lenovo support sound like they‚Äôre guessing random reasons each time instead of actually investigating?\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy is there no escalation path beyond helpless call center agents?\n\n‚∏ª\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è What I Expect:\n\nIf I don‚Äôt receive a clear delivery timeline or refund confirmation within 2‚Äì3 days, I‚Äôll be filing a consumer complaint under the Consumer Protection Act & tagging Lenovo India, Blue Dart, and relevant handles publicly.\n\nThis is beyond frustrating ‚Äî it‚Äôs mentally exhausting to keep chasing something I already paid for in full.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nLenovo India ‚Äî please do better.\nWe don‚Äôt deserve this kind of treatment for being loyal, paying customers.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n(Posting this so others thinking of ordering customized Lenovo laptops in India know what kind of delivery and support nightmare they might face.)",

I was using i7 8th gen processor , he quoted me around 25k for that, I thought it's better to our in some extra money and buy a new one instead of investing money in an ageing laptop . What do you guys think ? \nFor a new laptop my budget is around 70k that's the max I can stretch , I use laptop for media consumption and do coding, I am not a hardcore gamer, but I would love to play few games once in a while, for my usecase, can you guys suggest any good laptops with decent battery life and portability.

So, altogether I'm super annoyed with this device now. \n\nI would appreciate some unbiased advice on what laptop I should get, or whether to wait it out and just upgrade later?

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm posting this to share what‚Äôs been one of the worst customer experiences I‚Äôve ever had with a so-called ‚Äúpremium brand.‚Äù\nI ordered a customized Lenovo Legion Pro 5 (AMD Ryzen 9 + RTX 5060) for around ‚Çπ1.6 lakh, including 3 years of ADP and extended warranty.\n\n\nüì¶ Timeline of Events:\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 23: Product shipped from overseas and reached India (customs clearance done).\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 26‚Äì27: Tracking on Blue Dart shows ‚ÄúRTO initiated‚Äù (Return to Origin).\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 27: I contacted Blue Dart ‚Äî they said ‚Äúcontact the sender.‚Äù\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 27‚Äì29: I called Lenovo Post-Sales multiple times. They claimed my pincode was not serviceable (funny thing ‚Äî I‚Äôve already received Lenovo mouse & bag to the same address via Blue Dart!).\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 29: Lenovo support said they‚Äôd redirect my laptop to the nearest Blue Dart hub and asked if I could collect it myself. I agreed. They promised it‚Äôll reach in 24‚Äì48 hours.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 30: I visited the hub in person. The staff told me they never received any such shipment ‚Äî it was still stuck in Bangalore.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tI called again ‚Äî new agent said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know where the product is right now.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tThey gave me random excuses like ‚Äútax clearance delay,‚Äù ‚Äúbilling mismatch,‚Äù ‚Äúrisk in high-end product delivery‚Äù, and even told me to ‚Äújust wait.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhen I asked for a clear answer, one Lenovo agent literally said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know if it will be delivered or not.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tAnd when I pressed further, another replied, ‚ÄúWhy are you calling again and again? We‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù\n\n\n\nüò§ The Level of Misinformation:\n\nEvery time I contact Lenovo support, they give a different reason:\n\t‚Ä¢\tPincode not serviceable\n\t‚Ä¢\tHigh-end product, Blue Dart denying delivery\n\t‚Ä¢\tCustoms/billing issues after clearance\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúSystem updates in progress‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúWait 24‚Äì48 hours‚Äù ‚Äî repeated for 4 days straight\n\nIt‚Äôs been over a week since the product landed in India, and Lenovo India still can‚Äôt tell me where my ‚Çπ1.6 lakh laptop actually is.\n\n\n\nüìû Escalation:\n\nI‚Äôve already:\n\t‚Ä¢\tContacted Lenovo Post-Sale team multiple times.\n\t‚Ä¢\tGot a useless case ID from Madhusudhan K10 (Lenovo India) with zero update.\n\t‚Ä¢\tContacted Blue Dart, who confirmed the item was marked for return and asked me to reach Lenovo.\n\t‚Ä¢\tNow Lenovo claims they are ‚Äúchecking with Blue Dart,‚Äù but no timeline or accountability.\n\n\n\nüí¨ My Questions:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow can a premium brand like Lenovo lose track of a laptop worth ‚Çπ1.6L after it reaches the destination country?\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy does Lenovo support sound like they‚Äôre guessing random reasons each time instead of actually investigating?\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy is there no escalation path beyond helpless call center agents?\n\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è What I Expect:\n\nIf I don‚Äôt receive a clear delivery timeline or refund confirmation within 2‚Äì3 days, I‚Äôll be filing a consumer complaint under the Consumer Protection Act & tagging Lenovo India, Blue Dart, and relevant handles publicly.\n\nThis is beyond frustrating ‚Äî it‚Äôs mentally exhausting to keep chasing something I already paid for in full.\n\n\n\nLenovo India ‚Äî please do better.\nWe don‚Äôt deserve this kind of treatment for being loyal, paying customers.\n\n\n\n(Posting this so others thinking of ordering customized Lenovo laptops in India know what kind of delivery and support nightmare they might face.)",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm posting this to share what‚Äôs been one of the worst customer experiences I‚Äôve ever had with a so-called ‚Äúpremium brand.‚Äù\nI ordered a customized Lenovo Legion Pro 5 (AMD Ryzen 9 + RTX 5060) for around ‚Çπ1.6 lakh, including 3 years of ADP and extended warranty.\n\n\nüì¶ Timeline of Events:\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 23: Product shipped from overseas and reached India (customs clearance done).\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 26‚Äì27: Tracking on Blue Dart shows ‚ÄúRTO initiated‚Äù (Return to Origin).\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 27: I contacted Blue Dart ‚Äî they said ‚Äúcontact the sender.‚Äù\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 27‚Äì29: I called Lenovo Post-Sales multiple times. They claimed my pincode was not serviceable (funny thing ‚Äî I‚Äôve already received Lenovo mouse & bag to the same address via Blue Dart!).\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 29: Lenovo support said they‚Äôd redirect my laptop to the nearest Blue Dart hub and asked if I could collect it myself. I agreed. They promised it‚Äôll reach in 24‚Äì48 hours.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tOct 30: I visited the hub in person. The staff told me they never received any such shipment ‚Äî it was still stuck in Bangalore.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tI called again ‚Äî new agent said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know where the product is right now.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tThey gave me random excuses like ‚Äútax clearance delay,‚Äù ‚Äúbilling mismatch,‚Äù ‚Äúrisk in high-end product delivery‚Äù, and even told me to ‚Äújust wait.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhen I asked for a clear answer, one Lenovo agent literally said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know if it will be delivered or not.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tAnd when I pressed further, another replied, ‚ÄúWhy are you calling again and again? We‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù\n\n\n\nüò§ The Level of Misinformation:\n\nEvery time I contact Lenovo support, they give a different reason:\n\t‚Ä¢\tPincode not serviceable\n\t‚Ä¢\tHigh-end product, Blue Dart denying delivery\n\t‚Ä¢\tCustoms/billing issues after clearance\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúSystem updates in progress‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúWait 24‚Äì48 hours‚Äù ‚Äî repeated for 4 days straight\n\nIt‚Äôs been over a week since the product landed in India, and Lenovo India still can‚Äôt tell me where my ‚Çπ1.6 lakh laptop actually is.\n\n\n\nüìû Escalation:\n\nI‚Äôve already:\n\t‚Ä¢\tContacted Lenovo Post-Sale team multiple times.\n\t‚Ä¢\tGot a useless case ID from Madhusudhan K10 (Lenovo India) with zero update.\n\t‚Ä¢\tContacted Blue Dart, who confirmed the item was marked for return and asked me to reach Lenovo.\n\t‚Ä¢\tNow Lenovo claims they are ‚Äúchecking with Blue Dart,‚Äù but no timeline or accountability.\n\n\n\nüí¨ My Questions:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow can a premium brand like Lenovo lose track of a laptop worth ‚Çπ1.6L after it reaches the destination country?\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy does Lenovo support sound like they‚Äôre guessing random reasons each time instead of actually investigating?\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy is there no escalation path beyond helpless call center agents?\n\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è What I Expect:\n\nIf I don‚Äôt receive a clear delivery timeline or refund confirmation within 2‚Äì3 days, I‚Äôll be filing a consumer complaint under the Consumer Protection Act & tagging Lenovo India, Blue Dart, and relevant handles publicly.\n\nThis is beyond frustrating ‚Äî it‚Äôs mentally exhausting to keep chasing something I already paid for in full.\n\n\n\nLenovo India ‚Äî please do better.\nWe don‚Äôt deserve this kind of treatment for being loyal, paying customers.\n\n\n\n(Posting this so others thinking of ordering customized Lenovo laptops in India know what kind of delivery and support nightmare they might face.)",

Multiple docker containers, multiple chrome tabs, and ocassionally compiling code. For Games I usually play GTA 5, RDR2 in story mode just to have some fun, I'm not really a serious gamer.\n \nOther details (existing parts lists, whether any peripherals are needed, what you're upgrading from, when you're going to buy, what resolution and refresh rate you want to play at, etc): \n\nOne of the problems of living in Iraq is that ordering from Amazon, Newegg or other north american store is not a practical option, so we have to build with what components we have locally, I have posted the components along with their prices in IQD just for this post so you can have an idea of what alternatives I have and their prices.\nHere's the list: https://imgur.com/a/jmRatWv\n \nI have been researching and planning for the last couple of days, and here's the build I came up with:\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7900X (480,000 IQD ~ 342 USD)\nHaving a powerful CPU helps me in my development workflows, things like Docker and VMs require a CPU with good performance especially in multi core. Also, I believe my choice is future proof for at least 5+ years.\n \nRAM: G.SKILL Ripjaws M5 RGB DDR5 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz CL36,XMP & EXPO - White (400,000 IQD ~ 285 USD)\nRAM is essential to my workload, I want to run multiple docker containers and vscode instances while developing and debugging at the same time, and I want to have a little bit of room left as well, so 64GB is a safe bet. The problem is, the white color doesn't match my setup, and it's rather expensive, but, I have no other choice.\n \nThis is unavailable in the list I shared with you, so, I am going to custom order it from a different city\n \nMotherboard: MSI X870 GAMING PLUS WIFI (375,000 IQD ~ 267 USD)\nThis is an area I was totally confused with, there are lots of boards to choose from, I randomly chose this as I thought going with an X870 is future proof, has multiple NVMe slots with heat sinks, and good features overall, it is the platform I build on, so again, I don't want to cheap out on this.\n \nCPU Cooler: Liquid Freezer II (or III not sure) 360 A-RGB (235,000 IQD ~ 167 USD)\nI've heard nothing but good reviews about the liquid freezer.\n \nStorage: Samsung 990 Pro 1TB (175,000 IQD ~ 125 USD)\nGreat chip, sufficient storage.\n \nGPU: MSI VENTUS 2X RTX 3060 12GB OC (396,000 IQD ~ 282 USD)\nI know this is an older generation card, but it is more than enough to handle my display output and some ocasional gaming at 1440p or 4K, besides, I went with the cheapest one on my list.\n \nPSU: Segotep 850W Gold PCIe 5.1 (105,000 IQD ~ 75 USD)\nI have no idea about this PSU, I've read a couple of reviews saying to stay away from Segotep, but in all honesty I don't have much of an alternative, besides it is not crazy expensive.\n \nCase: Gamdias Atlas P2 CG Black RGB (140,000 IQD ~ 100 USD)\nThe case was the nicest among my list and priced reasonably.\n \nTOTAL BUILD COST IQD = 2,306,000 IQD\nTOTAL BUILD COST USD = ~1643\n \nI am coming from a Macbook Air M1 (8GB RAM) base model, I was using it for the last 4 years as my main development machine, it was and still is going strong, however, I am RAM limited, that's why I decided on building a custom PC.\n \nI would be happy if you have other opinions on my chosen parts, I love to hear your feedback!",

Except for the part where if I try to push to WiFi 5/6 speeds my router hates that and shuts down the whole network for whatever reason. So as of right now I'm at around 100 mbps down/up (which is more than good enough for most applications, but just for comparison's sake my older PC is able to do easily do 350 mbps down/up.)\n\n  \nThis now had me thinking: should I get a WiFi card if my goal is to get back to those similar speeds and for compatibility's sake? I keep seeing the Intel AX210 WiFi card pop up now and again and it theoretically should be compatible with my system. But what I have zero clue about is whether or not it'll basically nuke my internet for myself and my other devices like this current WiFi card does for some reason.\n\n  \nAny and all advice would be greatly appreciated since I've no idea what to do right now.

It is now time to step back and check what can be improved on the existing features we are proposing. So far, we have identified the following ones: \n\n* Fix some translated words in deutsch here and there; \n* Add a warning when a PSU is not enough powerful for the configuration (mostly GPU) selected; \n* Add more specifics tags to help people choosing between 2 products based on the community feedback (for instance, Ventus GPUs are known to be noisy); \n* Add an in-between way to build gaming PC configuration, maybe with some help from AI or something similar. \n\nPlease leave your very honest feedback here as it would help us a lot to build something better ! \n\nThank you everyone!",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have an older rig -  9600k (6-core) @ 4.7ghz, 3070, 32gb of ram and I play on a 34\" ultrawide at 3440x1440p. With that resolution and specs many new games I want to play are running poorly even at lower settings.\n\nI am seriously considering buying a 5070ti or something around that price range but I'm not sure how much my CPU will be a limiting factor for performance bottlenecks. I generally just build a new rig every 5-6 years but if possible I really just feel like upgrading the GPU and leaving it at that. \n\nWhat are your recommendations? Will I be fine just putting in a new GPU or will I have issues with my CPU being pretty old? New games like BF6, Clair Obscur, ARC raiders, etc are what I want to try and play.\n\nThanks for any input/advice\n",

    "selftext": "During a recent discussion with the person who I work with to prove custom sleeved cables for PSUs not supported by CableMod, I had asked about using 12VHPWR to 3x8/4x8pin cables instead and he was like \"Why?\" To stall off any accusations of him just trying to save on costs, that is not the case as I am the one that would be paying for any extra costs while he is more than willing to build them if instructed to.\n\nHis explanation actually made a lot of sense, so I wanted to ask the rest of you on your thoughts regarding the topic as well. His explanation was as follows:\n\n* 12VHPWR is only capable of providing up to 600W of power delivery\n* Each 8pin connector/cable is only capable of delivering up to 300w of power\n   * Unless PSU is multi-rail where each rail is incapable of providing 300w, more 8pin connectors are pointless\n   * NOTE: This is not 2x8p PCIe cables attaching to an adapter but a custom 12VHPWR cable terminating to 2x8p ports on the PSU side\n* What is important is that the connectors, terminals, and wires are high quality and is able to safely handle 300/600W delivery\n\nThoughts?",

    "title": "I'll upgrade my LGA1700 motherboard. Where should I go from here?",
    "selftext": "Hey, there! I usually don‚Äôt want to bother other people with my problems, but I‚Äôm really stumped with my choices for upgrades right now. Sorry if the post is way too worded.\n\n\n\n*A little context:* I've always been a tech enthusiast, but back in the day, the idea of building my own machine was just a costly dream. With time I ended really losing touch with the desktop scene. Almost a year ago, though, I built my first computer. I pretty much went with what I knew from my teenage years (the last time I was really up to date about tech) and got an Intel processor (i7 12700F) and an Nvidia GPU (3060 12GB), a combination which has worked quite alright, I've run everything I wanted in quite high settings. Having my own machine, I started going down the tech rabbit-hole. After some time I started to get more in depth with my research and discovered that I really dodge the bullet of the 13th and 14th generation of Intel CPUs. The thing is... I committed the cardinal sin of going cheap for my motherboard and (slightly lesser sin) my storage disk, leaving me with just a single M.2 slot and a 512GB SSD. \n\nNow... I found myself with some money to make upgrades. The first thing I would like to do, regardless of my choice in CPU socket, is to upgrade my motherboard to one with more M.2 slots, and a couple other improvements, like BIOS flashback and wireless connectivity. The thing is... I really don‚Äôt know where to go from here.\n\n\n\nI drafted the following paths:\n\n**Option A:** Just upgrade my motherboard and stay on Alder Lake-S. This is the cheaper option by a lot, but it means paying for a new board that has no true upgrade path, which makes me uneasy. I could put some money into an i9-12900K but the 30% increase in performance doesn't seem to be worth the price tag.\n\n**Option B:** Upgrade to Arrow Lake and get myself an Ultra 7 265K, this is the mid-range option. I realize that, most probably, Nova Lake will completely ditch the LGA1851 socket, making me stuck again. And, I also heard there where problems with these processors, even if not nearly as serious as with Raptor Lake. However, the performance bump is significant.\n\n**Option C:** Go red, and get myself an AMD Ryzen 9900X. This is the most expensive option. To begin with, the AM5 socket will be supported at least until 2027 according to AMD, so it would leave a path open for upgrades in the future if I have the money. However, every benchmark I examined shows that the 265K just performs better, even if slightly, and (this is also important) is $120 cheaper in my country's market.\n\n\n\nSo, that's it... I can't really make my mind. For some time I've considered going full AMD, including GPU, seeing how after Windows 10's end of support I decided to go for a Linux desktop, and Nvidia seems to be struggling there. What complicates this more, I guess, is the thought of paying more for less performance based on the benchmarks I've seen in several tech websites. \n\n  \n**TL/DR:** Tech-monkeys say Intel bad. Me-monkey considers AMD. But AMD is worth more bananas and Tech-monkeys' test shows that it calculates monkey-stocks a little slower. Me-monkey don't understand, just wants play Baldur's Gate 3.",

I just currently finished my first ever build that I copied from optimum (YouTuber) on a Mini-ITX case by M2. \n\nTo cut to the chase, I was well informed beforehand that the motherboard that I am using (as mentioned in title) would require a BIOS Flashback to support newer CPUs as I would be using a Ryzen 7 9800x3D.\n\nSo I followed the steps. Downloaded the latest BIOS update from the MSI site, placed it in a FAT32 format flash drive under 32 GB, inserted it in the Flash Bios port, and hit the Flashback Button. The stick now is that it has not stopped blinking, and I was also informed beforehand that the flashing means that the BIOS is \"updating\", and it shouldn't take more than a few minutes up to 15. It has now been 20 minutes and the flashing seems to still be going on.\n\nI am very adamant on touching anything as to not further mess anything up on the build if I already did, but I am seem to be stuck on a dead end. Forums aren't as well informed and the more I read the more I find out about this specific motherboard's flaws.\n\nFor other information, my build is as follows for any possible relevance to the issue.

I don't have a date yet as I'm in no hurry.\n\nFrom what I've read, DDR5 prices are unlikely to come back down at least for the next couple of years, and I just realized that in my country they probably still have some old stock and the price has not increased yet.\n\nComputer parts here are usually 15-25% more expensive than the sum of Amazon US price + shipping/fees (forget about Microcenter combos or anything similar), so seeing something cheaper is not very common.\n\nFor example I see TEAMGROUP T-Force Vulcan DDR5 32GB (2x16GB) 6000MHz (PC5-48000) CL38 in Amazon for $177 (+$22 shipping/import fees to my country = $199), while a local store is charging $120, so it's a whooping 40% cheaper.\n\nThere aren't that many options available (A few G.Skill, Teamgroup, and Patriot kits) and unfortunately there are no 48 or 64gb kits, so I would be locking in a downgrade in memory capacity for my next build, as I currently have 48gb. I didn't want to downgrade total memory, but my fear is that prices will only continue to increase and I could still end up with 32gb but paying much more.\n\nSo, what does your crystal ball say about DDR5 prices?",

    "selftext": "I currently have a cursed Gigabyte X670 Aorus Elite AX rev 1. (currently have 7800X3D)\n\nI'll list some horrendous issues/experiences that been plaguing me for the last 2 years.\n\n1. Encountered in the first few months that I bought this thing, the LAN port randomly shuts down as in Internets cuts off until you replug the LAN Cable for it to do the same thing minutes later (actually made me rage when I play online competitive games often and it always disconnects in important fights) (also tried the latest drivers from realtek and gigabyte, remediated this by getting a 2,5gbps LAN to USB dongle, never encountered it again so the Mobo LAN port is 100% problematic)\n2. The Wifi Chip is cursed, it will shut off the device itself and if not, it stutters the whole system if I don't disable the device itself in the device manager. (Tried the Latest drivers in the mobo page and latest ones from realtek and windows, still the same)\n3. The fucking enabling secure boot \"correct\" steps (found in an obscure reddit comment of all things)for the gigabyte motherboards or face a perma blackscreen.\n4. Manual inputs of Ram timings aren't saved in the normal OC ram tab in the bios, You need to go to the Advance Ram tab then under those you need to input the manual timings in hexadecimal for it to save.\n5. USB Ports on the case and on the Mobo itself just randomly not work... need to reboot the thing for them ports to work.\n6. For some reason, I'm not sure even if this is a Motherboard but I'm 99% sure, It will post to Bios loading but the Q LED on the mobo says there's a VGA Issue when my Monitor is picking up a signal , and it's just stuck in the BIOS not loading to windows. I replug/reseat the GPU (5080) then for some reason the Case headers does not work so I short the two pins with a screw driver to turn on the PC. This shit happened twice in the last two weeks. (Case header wires works fine after replugging it while PC is turned off).\n\nMy Warranty is 3 years with this shitty motherboard and I plan to return this crap and go to another brand either Asus or MSI (I plan to upgrade CPU eventually and I'm seeing Asrock Mobo frying 9800X3D, Can't have a potential 10800X3D getting fried right?)\n\nOn my local retail shop, I got the following options, all similar prices here.\n\n* MSI Motherboard MAG X870 Tomahawk\n* Asus Motherboard X870 Max Gaming\n* Asus Motherboard TUF Gaming B650-E\n* ASUS ROG Strix B850-A Gaming\n* MSI MAG B650 TOMAHAWK\n* MSI Motherboard B850 Gaming Plus\n\nI need some inputs on what Motherboard to get as a replacement, Im an enthusiast so I still plan to Manually tune my RAM, Undervolt my 7800X3D and Undervolt/OC my GPU. Imma probably sell my Gigabyte mobo when its returned.\n\nAlso my current build if its relevant:\n\n**CPU**¬†: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 5 GHz Boost (¬†*Undervolt: -30 PBO2 @ 89C¬∞ Limit.*¬†)  \n**GPU**¬†: Asus Prime RTX 5080 16GB (¬†*Undervolt: 2812MHz@865mV & +2000 Memory Clock || Overclock: Sustained 3240MHz, +500 Core Clock & +2000 Memory Clock*¬†)  \n**RAM**¬†: G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB 32GB DDR5 6000Mhz (¬†*CL30-38-38-30-68 1.25V Tuned Buildzoid Timings*¬†)  \n**Storage**¬†: WD SN850X 2TB M.2 2280 NVME PCIe Gen4 SSD  \n**CPU Cooler**¬†: Corsair H150 RGB 360mm Liquid AIO  \n**Mobo**¬†: Gigabyte X670 Aorus Elite AX Motherboard  \n**PSU**¬†: FSP Vita GM 1000W 80+ Cybernetics Gold || Platinum Efficiency PSU  \n**Case**¬†: Corsair 5000D Mid ATX (¬†*7 Intake & 3 Exhaust Fans setup with Optimized Fan Curves*¬†)  \n**OS**¬†: Windows 11 Pro",

I don't even know what motherboard or alimentation I have btw lol. Should I change my CPU, my GPU, or get a whole new PC ? \n\nNote: I play almost EVERY DAY, and YES i did play every day since the beginning.\n\n  \nP.S. : My budget is not unlimited, most i can go for is like 500ish i think ?

    "selftext": "Hey guys, I just picked up a PNY 5070Ti. Nice find at MSRP from Best Buy. Install went smooth and the card seems to be working nicely.\n\nI know there was a lot of buzz about the power connector issues on these 50 series cards, so I'm trying to be somewhat cautious. \n\nThe card came with the power adapter I expected it to - 3x8pin to 12v2x6. I initially intended to run 3 separate cables from my PSU, all standalone 8pins, to each port in the adapter. However, it turns out that my PSU came with 2 plain 8pin cables, and 2 8pin pigtail cables where the single 8pin from the PSU splits out into two 8pins at the other end of the cable. \n\nRather than leave an end of a pigtail cable hanging loose, I opted for 1 plain 8 pin, and one of the 8 pin pigtails with the two ends plugged into the remaining ends of the 3-way power adapter for the card. Each slot on the adapter is filled, there are no loose pigtail ends hanging around anywhere, and all connectors are fully seated. And again, they're all stock power cables that shipped with my PSU.\n\nIt seems like this configuration should be safe and fine, but I figured I'd ask here and see if I've made some glaring mistake. My PSU is an EVGA 850W 80+ Gold.\n\nIf I really need to I can pick up some normal 8pins from Cablemod. \n\nAny input? Thanks! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nLooking for some advice here. I've read plenty and am in a quandary. I'm trying to purchase a budget/entry level PC for my gf for the holidays, but am stuck on which route to go. \nThe PC would be used for 1440p BG3, Expedition 33, FF type games, web browsings, and possibly streaming down the road. \n\nI don't know how much this will actually get used, so I'd like to keep it around 1k with the option to upgrade later on, if life gives us more free time to game. \n\nCurrent options. \n\n- AMD R5-7600x w/ B650e ~$900 (old 1660super)\n\n- USED R7-9700 w/B850 ~$900 (old 1660super)\n\n- Costco MSI prbuilt Intel Ultra 7 w/ RTX5060 8GB ~$999\n\n\nAll the builds have 2TB storage, 32gb ddr5. \nI like the AM5 upgradability compared to Intel right now. And I know the 1660 Super is old, but she can upgrade later on if she wants. (The 1660s was meant to replace my gtx970, but I'll pass it to her to get her a usable rig)\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated!",

    "selftext": "Budget (including currency):\n1,700 USD (2,380,000 IQD) (1 USD = 1,400 IQD)\n \nCountry:\nIraq\n \nGames, programs or workloads that it will be used for:\n\nSingle or multiple VSCode instances. Multiple docker containers, multiple chrome tabs, and ocassionally compiling code. For Games I usually play GTA 5, RDR2 in story mode just to have some fun, I'm not really a serious gamer.\n \nOther details (existing parts lists, whether any peripherals are needed, what you're upgrading from, when you're going to buy, what resolution and refresh rate you want to play at, etc): \n\nOne of the problems of living in Iraq is that ordering from Amazon, Newegg or other north american store is not a practical option, so we have to build with what components we have locally, I have posted the components along with their prices in IQD just for this post so you can have an idea of what alternatives I have and their prices.\nHere's the list: https://imgur.com/a/jmRatWv\n \nI have been researching and planning for the last couple of days, and here's the build I came up with:\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7900X (480,000 IQD ~ 342 USD)\nHaving a powerful CPU helps me in my development workflows, things like Docker and VMs require a CPU with good performance especially in multi core. Also, I believe my choice is future proof for at least 5+ years.\n \nRAM: G.SKILL Ripjaws M5 RGB DDR5 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz CL36,XMP & EXPO - White (400,000 IQD ~ 285 USD)\nRAM is essential to my workload, I want to run multiple docker containers and vscode instances while developing and debugging at the same time, and I want to have a little bit of room left as well, so 64GB is a safe bet. The problem is, the white color doesn't match my setup, and it's rather expensive, but, I have no other choice.\n \nThis is unavailable in the list I shared with you, so, I am going to custom order it from a different city\n \nMotherboard: MSI X870 GAMING PLUS WIFI (375,000 IQD ~ 267 USD)\nThis is an area I was totally confused with, there are lots of boards to choose from, I randomly chose this as I thought going with an X870 is future proof, has multiple NVMe slots with heat sinks, and good features overall, it is the platform I build on, so again, I don't want to cheap out on this.\n \nCPU Cooler: Liquid Freezer II (or III not sure) 360 A-RGB (235,000 IQD ~ 167 USD)\nI've heard nothing but good reviews about the liquid freezer.\n \nStorage: Samsung 990 Pro 1TB (175,000 IQD ~ 125 USD)\nGreat chip, sufficient storage.\n \nGPU: MSI VENTUS 2X RTX 3060 12GB OC (396,000 IQD ~ 282 USD)\nI know this is an older generation card, but it is more than enough to handle my display output and some ocasional gaming at 1440p or 4K, besides, I went with the cheapest one on my list.\n \nPSU: Segotep 850W Gold PCIe 5.1 (105,000 IQD ~ 75 USD)\nI have no idea about this PSU, I've read a couple of reviews saying to stay away from Segotep, but in all honesty I don't have much of an alternative, besides it is not crazy expensive.\n \nCase: Gamdias Atlas P2 CG Black RGB (140,000 IQD ~ 100 USD)\nThe case was the nicest among my list and priced reasonably.\n \nTOTAL BUILD COST IQD = 2,306,000 IQD\nTOTAL BUILD COST USD = ~1643\n \nI am coming from a Macbook Air M1 (8GB RAM) base model, I was using it for the last 4 years as my main development machine, it was and still is going strong, however, I am RAM limited, that's why I decided on building a custom PC.\n \nI would be happy if you have other opinions on my chosen parts, I love to hear your feedback!",

Except for the part where if I try to push to WiFi 5/6 speeds my router hates that and shuts down the whole network for whatever reason. So as of right now I'm at around 100 mbps down/up (which is more than good enough for most applications, but just for comparison's sake my older PC is able to do easily do 350 mbps down/up.)\n\n  \nThis now had me thinking: should I get a WiFi card if my goal is to get back to those similar speeds and for compatibility's sake? I keep seeing the Intel AX210 WiFi card pop up now and again and it theoretically should be compatible with my system. But what I have zero clue about is whether or not it'll basically nuke my internet for myself and my other devices like this current WiFi card does for some reason.\n\n  \nAny and all advice would be greatly appreciated since I've no idea what to do right now.

This would let me practice more often, try new configurations, and stay more engaged with the hobby as well.\n\nBefore I dive in, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Has anyone here tried something similar? \n* Are there hidden challenges I should be aware of like needing warranties or support expectations?\n* Any tips on how to structure this so it‚Äôs sustainable and transparent?\n\nMy initial idea entailed providing the buyer with all receipts and original packaging, so that if there were any issues with a component, they could use any existing manufacturers' warranties. \n\n I‚Äôm not looking to compete with anyone or make money.

    "selftext": "I've been trying to troubleshoot this issue for most of this year.\n\nWhat I've noticed is that I get random blackouts on my primary monitor when a television set is connected through HDMI - even when a DisplayPort to HDMI converter is used.\n\nSomething appears to be tripping the hot-plug detection, even when a connected TV is off or in \"sleep\", as newer sets seem to always be.\n\nI have had this happen with:\n\n\\* two video cards (a 3080 and a 5070)  \n\\* two television sets (a 2013 Phillips HDTV and a 2024 Hisense QD7)  \n\\* multiple VESA-certified DP cables  \n\\* two LG monitors  \n\\* two different HDMI cables (one 1.4 and one 2.1)  \n\\* three breaker circuits in my apartment  \n\\* connected to a UPS and connected to a power strip\n\nI was able to reliably reproduce the issue when the HDTV was powered on a different breaker line than my UPS. I began to notice that if the HDMI connector brushed up against the PC chassis in just the right way, it would trigger the exact same temporary blank-out on my DisplayPort-connected monitor, even when the TV was off.\n\nNow that I've made the upgrade to a newer TV set, I have an older Logitech audio system plugged into its headphone jack. I've noticed that when the blackouts happen at random, there is an audible click from the audio system (it stays on), the same kind of noise you would hear from connecting or disconnecting the jack.\n\nI've checked all of the wiring, done multimeter tests; I've lived in this apartment for 20 years and have never had this issue until earlier this year when I moved the PC to a location barely 20 feet from where it was before.\n\nAnd even with the same components that I first began experiencing this with, I used them in the same setup in that previous location (3080, DisplayPort, LG monitor, HDTV) and never once had this happen.\n\nI changed rooms and it was happening regularly but infrequently enough that I'd forget. Now that I've upgraded the card, the cabling, the monitor and the TV, it happens several times a day.",

I think I‚Äôll also need to upgrade my motherboard, since it apparently isn‚Äôt compatible with the newer CPU generations.\n\nSo my main question is: **what motherboard and CPU would you recommend for upgrading my PC?**\n\nHere are my current specs:\n\n* **Motherboard:** MSI H110M PRO-VH PLUS\n* **Processor:** Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU G4560 @ 3.50GHz\n* **RAM:** 16 GB DDR4\n* **Storage:**\n   * 932 GB HDD (WDC WD10EZEX-08WN4A0)\n   * 466 GB HDD (WDC WD5000LPCX-00VHAT0)\n   * 224 GB SSD (WDC WDS240G2G0A-00JH30)\n* **Graphics Card:** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 (2 GB)\n\nMy budget is around **$500**, but I can save up a bit more if it means getting components that will last me longer.\n\nThanks in advance, everyone!",

    "selftext": "Budget (including currency):\n1,700 USD (2,380,000 IQD) (1 USD = 1,400 IQD)\n \nCountry:\nIraq\n \nGames, programs or workloads that it will be used for:\n\nSingle or multiple VSCode instances. Multiple docker containers, multiple chrome tabs, and ocassionally compiling code. For Games I usually play GTA 5, RDR2 in story mode just to have some fun, I'm not really a serious gamer.\n \nOther details (existing parts lists, whether any peripherals are needed, what you're upgrading from, when you're going to buy, what resolution and refresh rate you want to play at, etc): \n\nOne of the problems of living in Iraq is that ordering from Amazon, Newegg or other north american store is not a practical option, so we have to build with what components we have locally, I have posted the components along with their prices in IQD just for this post so you can have an idea of what alternatives I have and their prices.\nHere's the list: https://imgur.com/a/jmRatWv\n \nI have been researching and planning for the last couple of days, and here's the build I came up with:\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7900X (480,000 IQD ~ 342 USD)\nHaving a powerful CPU helps me in my development workflows, things like Docker and VMs require a CPU with good performance especially in multi core. Also, I believe my choice is future proof for at least 5+ years.\n \nRAM: G.SKILL Ripjaws M5 RGB DDR5 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz CL36,XMP & EXPO - White (400,000 IQD ~ 285 USD)\nRAM is essential to my workload, I want to run multiple docker containers and vscode instances while developing and debugging at the same time, and I want to have a little bit of room left as well, so 64GB is a safe bet. The problem is, the white color doesn't match my setup, and it's rather expensive, but, I have no other choice.\n \nThis is unavailable in the list I shared with you, so, I am going to custom order it from a different city\n \nMotherboard: MSI X870 GAMING PLUS WIFI (375,000 IQD ~ 267 USD)\nThis is an area I was totally confused with, there are lots of boards to choose from, I randomly chose this as I thought going with an X870 is future proof, has multiple NVMe slots with heat sinks, and good features overall, it is the platform I build on, so again, I don't want to cheap out on this.\n \nCPU Cooler: Liquid Freezer II (or III not sure) 360 A-RGB (235,000 IQD ~ 167 USD)\nI've heard nothing but good reviews about the liquid freezer.\n \nStorage: Samsung 990 Pro 1TB (175,000 IQD ~ 125 USD)\nGreat chip, sufficient storage.\n \nGPU: MSI VENTUS 2X RTX 3060 12GB OC (396,000 IQD ~ 282 USD)\nI know this is an older generation card, but it is more than enough to handle my display output and some ocasional gaming at 1440p or 4K, besides, I went with the cheapest one on my list.\n \nPSU: Segotep 850W Gold PCIe 5.1 (105,000 IQD ~ 75 USD)\nI have no idea about this PSU, I've read a couple of reviews saying to stay away from Segotep, but in all honesty I don't have much of an alternative, besides it is not crazy expensive.\n \nCase: Gamdias Atlas P2 CG Black RGB (140,000 IQD ~ 100 USD)\nThe case was the nicest among my list and priced reasonably.\n \nTOTAL BUILD COST IQD = 2,306,000 IQD\nTOTAL BUILD COST USD = ~1643\n \nI am coming from a Macbook Air M1 (8GB RAM) base model, I was using it for the last 4 years as my main development machine, it was and still is going strong, however, I am RAM limited, that's why I decided on building a custom PC.\n \nI would be happy if you have other opinions on my chosen parts, I love to hear your feedback!",

People can literally hack your PC and install malware if you just sit in the menu's on the older CODs. MW2019 uses a different engine and dedicated servers and there hasn't been any reports of RCE exploits on that COD or newer CODs. So it got me curious, if P2P CODs have RCE exploits, do older games that use P2P also have RCE exploits and are unsafe to play? ",

Rather than let it die, I'm making it open source in hopes that someone in the community will pick it up and continue development.\n\n**Looking for Maintainers:**\nI'm specifically looking for someone who wants to seriously take on the project and manage the public repository. If you're interested or want to discuss, join the Fuzion Discord - link to Discord in the repo readme.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/stomane/fuzion\n\nFeel free to fork it, fix it, improve it, or use it as a learning resource. The code is all yours now!\n\nThanks to everyone who used Fuzion over the years. Here's hoping it gets a second life in the hands of the community! üôè",

    "title": "Why do so many people dislike the Epic Games Launcher‚Äôs UI? Am I missing something?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, hope you‚Äôre all doing good.\n\nSo I saw a post earlier where someone was asking whether to buy *Arc Raiders* on Epic or Steam. They ended up going with Steam, which is fair, but it reminded me how every time this topic comes up people go *‚ÄúSteam‚Äôs better. Epic‚Äôs UI sucks.‚Äù*\n\nAnd I‚Äôm just curious, what *exactly* is it that people dislike so much about Epic‚Äôs UI?\n\nI use both pretty evenly, and honestly, they feel about the same to me. Most of what I do is:\n\n* Buy games\n* Read game pages / watch trailers\n* Launch games\n\nFor those things, both launchers get the job done. Epic even loads faster on my PC, Steam always does its little update check on startup, which takes a bit.\n\nWhen it comes to the library, I actually kinda prefer Epic‚Äôs layout. The quick launch tab and filters (like ‚Äúinstalled only‚Äù or ‚Äúrecently added‚Äù) are super handy. Steam‚Äôs library always feels a bit cluttered unless I manually organize everything.\n\nThat said, Steam definitely wins once you click on a specific game, the playtime, achievements, screenshots, reviews, all that. Epic mostly just shows the title unless you go to the store page.\n\nStill, in day-to-day use, I just click *Play* or *Launch* and that‚Äôs it. Steam has Big Picture Mode and better controller input stuff, sure, but I don‚Äôt really use overlays or custom mappings anyway since my Xbox controller works fine in most games.\n\nSo yeah, for people who *really* dislike Epic‚Äôs launcher:  \n\\-What is it specifically that bothers you?  \n\\-Is it missing features like achievements/workshop/etc.?  \n\\-Or do you just find the design itself clunky or ugly?\n\nNot talking about the ‚ÄúI want all my games in one place‚Äù thing, that‚Äôs fair. I mean purely when people say Epic‚Äôs *UI/UX* is bad. What about it makes it bad to you?\n\n**TL;DR:** I use both Steam and Epic about the same and don‚Äôt see a big difference. What about Epic‚Äôs *UI* makes people dislike it so much?",

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms.

Yet all we hear is company XYZ cutting corners, firing staff, poor optimizations, $90 price tag etc. while somehow these companies are also still not making enough money?  \n  \nFor example, how was Infinity Ward/Activision able to make one of the greatest COD games MW2 in 16 months and run on a PS3 with 256mb ram near flawlessly, but I can‚Äôt even run Warzone smoothly on low settings on my fucking RTX5070 with 32gb RAM, and they‚Äôve been actively developing/patching that garbage for like 5-7 years? Not to mention the fact they‚Äôve milked revenue from that game the whole time through skins while MW2 was being patched for free.     \n  \n  \nIt sounds stupid, but did these companies forget about saving money by hiring talented people who can manage projects and create quality products within reasonable constraints, who understand limitations and can be creative to work around them? Why are studios hiring people who create garbage then spend a year(s) post production patching the game to make it playable? In the construction industry there‚Äôs a saying we use along the lines of, ‚ÄúIf you have time to come back and fix it, you had time to do it right the first time.‚Äù. \n  \nBit of a rant but also a general curiosity on how this industry has completely evolved to something that doesn‚Äôt seem to understand what they‚Äôve got their hands on.

I think gaming rage comes from a lack of control. \n\nYou can control how YOU play. Your micro, macro, game sense, hero selection, strategy, mindset, etc.\n\nYou can't control what kinds of teammates you get queued up with, how they play, or the reliability of your internet/system. Notice how a lot of competitive games are labeled as \"toxic\"? Its because people are always blaming others.\n\nI can't think of a single time where I hard raged in a single player game. Why? Because I know that my perfomance is directly related the only variable; me. \n\nSorry for the yap. Was pooping on the toliet and just wanted to share my thoughts.\n\n",

No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a long road, but this one‚Äôs been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "Hi r/PCGaming!\n\nI'm Vince, solo developer of Decimation. Its a sci-fi tower defense game where your towers provide covering fire, but they can't win without you actively fighting with your hero.  \n  \n**What makes it different:**   \nMost tower defense games: Place towers optimally, watch them win. Maybe a hero helps occasionally. In Decimation, if you're not actively using your hero to fight, you lose.   \n  \n**Your hero has:**\n\n* 4 active skills requiring timing and positioning \n* Target-lock system (you choose priority targets, towers can't) \n* Resource collection mid-combat for ultimate ability \n* Meaningful skill expression - button mashing ‚â† skillful play\n\nYou can survive by coasting on easier difficulties, but zero-damage perfect runs require execution.  \nThink: TD macro (placement, resources, tower upgrades) + action micro (hero combat with cooldown management, positioning, battle effect usage).\n\n**About the demo:**\n\n* 4 campaign levels (Act 1 complete) \n* 1 boss encounter\n\n*Note: Levels 1-2 teach mechanics.* ***Levels 3-4 + boss are where skill expression really matters.***\n\n**Free to download and play**  \nüéÆ Demo Download: [https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation](https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation)  \n  \nThis is a solo passion project. 17 months of development so far. Early Access planned for late 2025 with 3 additional acts for the final game. I'll be around to answer questions about the game, the development process, or anything else.   \n  \nThanks all and sincerely hope to hear from you. Would genuinely love feedback on whether the skill-based approach resonates with TD players.",

    "selftext": "I picked it up yesterday to play with my friends for the first time. I was surprised (in a positive way) at how mechanicaly complex it can be, especially the organizing and reparing the RV part of the game. It seems like the type of game that it's both fun and exciting to master in the long run, BUT I was astonished at how bad it overall works. To the point of taking you out of the immersion multiple times.\n\n\\- This is a physics-based game in which the physics barely work. The rope, the constantly clipping in and out of the RV, the weird collision issues... it's everywhere.\n\n\\- This is a pity, but there's barely a sense of danger or stakes whatosever. From time to time an animal will attack, or there will be a terrain obstacle to overcome, but that's pretty much it. In a way it's cool, this can be a calmer game that, let's say, Peak or REPO. But it also means that in the moment to moment gameplay it can sometimes be somewhat boring, especially because--\n\n\\- This is one of my biggest complaints right now. The multiplayer of this game i feel is not balanced. There were four of us in the RV, and for most of the time, it feels like the game would have worked better with just two. It didn't seem to me like there was much to be done. The person driving has such and advantage mechanically, and there can also be a person looking at the map, but other than that, this is not a Sea of Theves type of thing were EVERY person is needed to manouver the boat. The other two of us were just in the back, seated because you can NOT be walking around the RV while someone's driving because the physics turn crazy. That means it's not a time that you can spend maybe organising the cabinets, playing cards (this is not a mechanic but it would be cool) or something like that.\n\nI want to end on a positive note. Like I said, I really love the premise of the game. It's so unique and full of potential (the chain-smoking is hilarious). If it was well polished and with expanded mechanics, this could be like a land version of Sea of Thieves. But right now is everything but polished. It's so bizarre to me that this is a 1.0 release and not an early access.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe‚Äôve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It‚Äôs a fast, chaotic beat ‚Äôem up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who‚Äôs Mexican, and it‚Äôs directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt‚Äôs basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It‚Äôs been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo‚Äôs now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We‚Äôve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that‚Äôs part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I‚Äôll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

Each puzzle is based on real electrical problems - like building a charger from scratch or regulating voltage... It's all powered by an actual [SPICE simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE), so circuits behave the way they would in real life.\n\nWe‚Äôre trying to make electronics *feel approachable and creative*, instead of intimidating. You can mess around, short-circuit things (safely!), and learn by doing.\n\nIt‚Äôs equal parts **STEM sandbox** and **cozy story game** \\- we are thinking of adding in lo-fi beats and already have pastel visuals, and a hamster named Crispy who occasionally powers your circuits with his wheel.\n\nWe‚Äôd love to hear what the PC gaming crowd thinks:\n\n* Do educational-but-cozy games like this appeal to you?\n* Would you rather see more structured challenges, or full sandbox freedom to experiment?\n\nAppreciate any feedback, especially from folks who would find themselves at the crossroads of:\n\n* Assemble With Care\n* Trash Goblin\n* Spirit City: Lofi Sessions\n* PC Building Simulator\n* Little Rocket Lab",

Rather than let it die, I'm making it open source in hopes that someone in the community will pick it up and continue development.\n\n**Looking for Maintainers:**\nI'm specifically looking for someone who wants to seriously take on the project and manage the public repository. If you're interested or want to discuss, join the Fuzion Discord - link to Discord in the repo readme.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/stomane/fuzion\n\nFeel free to fork it, fix it, improve it, or use it as a learning resource. The code is all yours now!\n\nThanks to everyone who used Fuzion over the years. Here's hoping it gets a second life in the hands of the community! üôè",

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community:¬†[https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

Each puzzle is based on real electrical problems - like building a charger from scratch or regulating voltage... It's all powered by an actual [SPICE simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE), so circuits behave the way they would in real life.\n\nWe‚Äôre trying to make electronics *feel approachable and creative*, instead of intimidating. You can mess around, short-circuit things (safely!), and learn by doing.\n\nIt‚Äôs equal parts **STEM sandbox** and **cozy story game** \\- we are thinking of adding in lo-fi beats and already have pastel visuals, and a hamster named Crispy who occasionally powers your circuits with his wheel.\n\nWe‚Äôd love to hear what the PC gaming crowd thinks:\n\n* Do educational-but-cozy games like this appeal to you?\n* Would you rather see more structured challenges, or full sandbox freedom to experiment?\n\nAppreciate any feedback, especially from folks who would find themselves at the crossroads of:\n\n* Assemble With Care\n* Trash Goblin\n* Spirit City: Lofi Sessions\n* PC Building Simulator\n* Little Rocket Lab",

Unable to install games and then it just worked. Windows updates not working and so on. (I've changed to different bios versions and fresh install windows 2 times) I've run memtest86 that failed first time and 2nd time passed test. The pc was somewhat stable for a couple of days I got the new Amd drivers and it just couldn't update. So I uninstalled all amd drivers and software and then I could not even install the adrenalin app (got stuck at 100) now I figured out that it was the d.o.c.p that caused all my problems. \n\nSo my question now is.. Is there any chance because of all the problems with chrasing installs and so on that even if the games and software now works is not running that 100% I want from the pc? I'm worried some files maybe corrupted or damaged or what ever and I'm not getting the best performance possible. Is my worries correct or am I all wrong? \n\nMy background is from car engines and stuff and there if you run the engine with a problem there is a big chance something gets damaged and need to change not just the faulty part. And pc is all new to me. \n\nThanks for your time in before hand and sorry for my bad English! ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'll start this post by listing my PC's configuration so you can get an idea of the machine:\n\n* Video card: Nvidia GeForce 1660 SUPER\n* Processor: Ryzen 5 3600\n* RAM: G.Skrill 2x8GB DDR4 3200MHz\n* Motherboard: MSI B450M-A PRO MAX\n* Power supply (_should_ be this one): iTek TAURUS BS750w (80Plus Bronze)\n\nAs the title more or less indicates, I had been experiencing stability issues with my PC while gaming for some time: specifically, after a certain amount of time (regardless of whether the game was light or heavy: DbD, CoD, EA FC, Rainbow), it would start to lag heavily, with the monitor turning black; At this point, I was forced to restart the PC, or sometimes it would restart on its own.\n\nTrying to investigate the nature of the problem, I began to conduct stress tests on the SSD, RAM, video card, and processor, but no problems were detected; the components were working smoothly without any issues.\n\nDigging around online, I discovered the Windows \"Event Viewer\" feature, where I found this critical event: *Event 41, Kernel-Power, Activity Category 61*. Unfortunately, I discovered that this event in itself is not meaningful, but that it _could be related to a problem with the RAM or the power supply._\n\nIn any case, since I didn't know where to go from there, I decide to do a total format and a clean reinstallation of Windows, but I decide to install 10 because 11 still has compatibility issues.\n\nAfter reinstalling various programs and games, I start playing EA FC 26 (with automatic settings) and _Battlefield 6 (with low settings... ahem)_ and *didn't notice any problems.* I was able to play smoothly, without any performance drops.\n\nI told myself that the problem finally seemed to be solved... but _it seems_ not! I played a few games on Battlefield 6 and Rainbow with friends, communicating with them through Discord:\n\n* on Battlefield, I experienced performance drops (i.e., frame drops and audio glitches), but I managed to finish two games without too many problems\n* on Rainbow (a much lighter game than BF), I experienced an absurd frame drop for a few seconds, with the PC seeming like it was about to crash, but this drop passed almost immediately and the game returned to normal\n\nNow, in your opinion, *what could be the actual cause of these problems?* I really don't know what to consider.\n\nP.S.: I was told that these instability issues are caused by the monitor, which is the following:\n\nhttps://ibb.co/6Jqgq2V8\n\nbut I'll leave it up to you to judge. :-)",

Pc shuts down and the power in the house restarts 2 seconds later.\n\nI try safe booting but It doesnt detect my mouse nor keyboard.

They are all going to push and pitch me into something that suits their needs. \n\nI struggle with buying computers. I overthink it, I‚Äôm anxious, and albeit, a little OCD. \n\nAbout me. I mainly use my computer for writing projects and research. Sure I do some Roll20 TTRPG/VTT (gaming if you could call it that) but nothing graphically crazy. When I say I need speed I need to have multiple screens connected with multiple word docs opened and multiple tabs of a web browser open on various research topics. I need to be able to bounce between all of that and then back to my word doc. I need to write and edit freely without some spinning wheel trying to catch up. And when I say multiple word documents I mean hundreds of pages all with internal links for easy navigation. Hopefully that paints the picture. \n\nMy current setup is an outdated all-in-one that has outlived its usefulness and can‚Äôt even update to Win11 (yes a PC person here but willing to change). \n\nI mainly write from my home office so there isn‚Äôt a huge need to have a laptop. If that helps or hinders the search results you tell me. I just don‚Äôt know if I should guide the salespersons towards a tower, stick with the all-in-one concept, or move towards a laptop? I know they each have their pros and cons but with speed being the issue do I need to lean in towards 32 GB ram? 64? Does that then push a decently priced laptop out of the running (I‚Äôm not looking to pay the crazy prices of say an Alienware laptop). I‚Äôm also okay waiting for holiday sales.

Anyways that aside would it be a better experience to purchase it from the Nvidia site or Bestbuy's website? The last two 5070 fe's I got from Bestbuy had coil whine, and I don't know if it gets tossed around more if I buy it from them compared to Nvidia themselves. Also the return would theoretically be easier at Bestbuy, but I don't know if I hit the limit at this point.",

    "selftext": "So bear with me, this is probably 2-3 minutes of reading. I think there‚Äôs some good info here. I‚Äôm just looking for more information that I could be missing but I am looking for legitimate and technical information. This isn‚Äôt super in-depth college level stuff it‚Äôs pretty simple. Feel free to throw real technical stuff out there. (I have a bachelors in electrical engineering from Missouri S&T so I can handle it) And please don‚Äôt reply with ‚Äúit‚Äôs better rawr I‚Äôm mad now cause you questioned the almighty x3d!‚Äù lol \n\nI‚Äôve gathered this info just from the specs on AMD website that they have for both cards. The 7700x has a higher base frequency (4.5) than the 7800x3d (4.2). 7700x also has a higher boost by .4. They both have 8core/16threads. The 7800x3d is using more L3 cache (and a different version yes, 3d, but all it does is allow more L3 cache not necessarily a different cache entirely) and it does make it better but not like a whole new generation of chips. They are both Zen4 architecture and am5 socket. \n\nSo a 5-10% increase to the CPU alone (and this is just in scenarios where L3 cache specifically means more than clocks where the 7700x will outshine in pretty much all workstation scenarios) doesn‚Äôt mean a 5-10% increase to your entire computer‚Äôs performance. Unless of course it is just your cpu that is behind but that‚Äôs usually not the case once we‚Äôre in this ballpark. There‚Äôs simply more to computers than L3 cache alone. Yes it‚Äôs important but so is vrm and temperature throttling on even a 7600x that‚Äôs overclocked.\n\nNow can someone expand on this please? (without saying ‚Äúit is so much better I‚Äôm mad now‚Äù) Is it all hype or am I misinterpreting the numbers somewhere?",

    "selftext": "I have been having FPS drops on Fortnite and Apex specifically, but to my knowledge no other games have not been affected. I have played games such as rainbow, rust, Ghost of Tsushima, warzone, valorant, Minecraft, ea fc 26, and etc.. In other words a wide range of games. I used MSI Afterburner to figure out it is due to what I think is GPU usage drops. I cannot figure out why it is dropping though. The hertz do not drop, only GPU usage, depending on what setting I have on it can drop from 90 to 5 or 60 to 5, due to DX11, DX12 ect.\n\nSPECS:\n\nRyzen 7 98000 x3d\n\nRTX 5070 12 gb\n\n750 W ps\n\n32 gb of ram\n\nB850 mobo\n\n2 tb m.2\n\nNotes:\n\n\\- I do have 3 monitors ranging from 60 hrtz, 144, 240 with 240 being my main one. I have tried all different displays and all still have gpu drops\n\n\\- My computer does have AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics but as far as I can tell, through multiple programs and task manager, it is not being used at all.\n\n\\-only happens on Fortnite and Apex legends\n\n\\- temps seem to be fine according to MSI afterburner and L-connect (CPU cooler software)\n\nWhat I have tried to fix Fortnite (haven't even begun troubleshooting apex):\n\n\\- I have tried all Fortnite specific settings, such as DX11, DX12, Performance, Legacy Performance. I  played multiple games on each setting none fixed. I also went through and put lowest setting for each and went up from there.\n\n\\- verified game files\n\n\\- Cleared Shader cache in files\n\n\\- Adjusted Nividia graphic settings, such as high performance mode, and 10 gb shader cache size, and others. I have tried the \"optimized settings\" according to youtube and other resources\n\n\\- Uninstalled Nividia Graphics and did a clean install of newest drivers for 5070\n\n\\- Optimize windows settings such as, updated power plan for possible power bottleneck, high performance mode  and gpu performance on windows, again used most optimized settings according to online resources\n\nWhat I am about to try is adjust bios settings for the integrated graphics to fully disable them from there and check ram is being used fully and other things and reinstalling fornite. I did not try this before because like i said it is and apex and Fortnite thing so I don't think reinstalling fortnite will fix it. I will update this post once finished.\n\nOverall - I have tried many other small fixes through files, windows registry and other things but none have worked. I have used the most optimized settings to at the very least have some sort of baseline to make sure I don't have a crazy setting enabled or disabled. I am looking for suggestions on how to fix this. I will let you know if I have already tried it because I did skip over a lot of small things that I tried because this would be the longest post ever if I went over every little thing. The thing that confuses me is that I have tried all these optimized settings but none have fixed which leads me to believe it is a hardware issue rather than a software issue but, again, it only happens on apex and fortnite so wouldn't that have to mean this is a hardware issue that causes GPU usage drops that only happens in fortnite and apex out for several different games? Which confuses me the most. I am not the most supper tech savy guy in the world so I could be missing something obvious, that means PLEASE DO NOT BE AFRAID TO SUGGEST ANYTHING EVEN IF IT IS OBVIOUS.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22wdnog0edyf1.png?width=889&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e36ad2a040f838804eb24436e3314049ffe38d9\n\n",

    "selftext": "UPDATE: Tested out the games I listed here and turns out reinstalling drivers with DDU only benefited helldivers 2, the rest were still performing bad. \n\nMy current pc (Prebuilt) , which has a 3060ti, R5 5600G and 16GB of ram has been struggling running games since the start of the year. I bought this system in 2023 and as of recently, the performance has been very bad. Games such as helldivers 2 (Difficulty 7), Phasmophobia, GTA 5 enhanced, cyberpunk 2077, Black ops 6, Battlefield Redsec, and even dying light 1 are running pretty poorly. Performance started to drop in February of this year and it‚Äôs been getting worse and worse with cpu bottlenecks occurring on every game I play. I keep my system clean, run security checks in case some sort of malware is on my pc (which there isn‚Äôt) and adjust in game settings (I use benchmark kings setting and use medium/low preset with dlss quality/performance) but even after doing all that, I can‚Äôt seem to get over 60fps and when I do, I just get micro stuttering and fps drops. The GPU tends to be sitting below 65% whereas the CPU is over 80%, sometimes going to 90%. I play on 1080p with 120hz monitor. I was considering on getting dying light the beast and Clair obscure: Expedition 33 but now I‚Äôm not sure my pc can handle them. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing performance to be so bad. At first I thought the performance would get better over time but that wasn‚Äôt the case and here I am. ",

    "selftext": "To start off, I want to say thank you for reading this. I have had my PC since around the end of 2021. It is a prebuilt given to me from my dad-- I wish I could have chosen to build it, but as this was my first pc I was not very confident in my ability. I am now 18 and torn between scrapping the old girl and building a new one, or trying to save this one. I have tried everything that I could think of, but it was to no avail. \n\nPROBLEM\n\nMy PC used to be able to hit mid to high graphic at 1440p 144fps on AAA games and run fine when I first got it, but recently as of 2023 or 2024 I can only run low settings on 1080p 120fps, as my PC likes to fully crash and restart, and even on those low settings it often crashes. Attributed to my laziness, I had long ignored this and just avoided when it crashed. I was pushed to make this post because last week I couldn't play a single game without it crashing on lowest settings at 480p 60fps. I just had to not play games that week, but it seems its back to crashing at 1080p. Frequent games I have played over the years are Overwatch, Dead By Daylight, Rainbow Six Siege, and Minecraft, with everything but Minecraft crashing at low graphics. Heck, I have had Roblox crash on me a bunch too. The nature of the crash seems like it might be a CPU issue, maybe not enough power or too much causing it to shut it all off? Maybe it is overheating? My CPU idles at around 60-70C. Adding to this, my case fans look like they are running slow, as I can kind of trace them with my eyes. I have ran a lot of diagnostic checks with them all saying everything was fine, except for one time. This one time it said there was something wrong with my SSD, but I don't remember what it said exactly as it was a while ago.\n\nTHINGS I TRIED\n\n\\- I frequently clean out my PC of dust and debris\n\n\\- New thermal paste\n\n\\- Added more RAM (2\\*8Gb -> 4\\*8Gb)\n\n\\- Frequently scan for viruses and do diagnostic checks using BIOS\n\n\\- Frequently update GPU drivers, CPU drivers, and Windows\n\n\\- Overclocking RAM, fans, CPU, and GPU\n\nSPECS\n\nMODEL- HP Omen 30L\n\nCPU - Ryzen 7 5800x\n\nCPU COOLER - Don't know the name of it but it is liquid cooled with a single fan at the top of the case. (I have never changed the coolant, am I supposed to?)\n\nMOTHERBOARD - All I know is it is MSI\n\nGPU - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070TI\n\nSSD - Don't know the name, 1TB\n\nRAM - Kingston FURY Beast 4\\*8Gb DDR4 2400MT/s\n\nPOWER SUPPLY - Cooler Master 80+ Gold 800W\n\nTHINGS TO NOTE\n\n\\- It is currently plugged into a power strip, but this has been a problem even when it had its own wall plug\n\n  \nIf anyone could help, that would be phenomenal. This has been a problem for a while and I need to make decision on what to do going forward. I'm not a regular Reddit user so if you guys could upvote this to let more people see it, that would be helpful (if that's how it works). If you made it this far, thank you for your time! I will be sure to answer anything down below.",

All in two days. The one part I needed most to actually finish the system is now nearly 60% more expensive than it‚Äôs ever been.\n\nTo make it worse, my part-time job just ended (temporary contract), so now I‚Äôm stuck, either find a new job, borrow from parents, or sell what I‚Äôve already got. Getting this job was a pain and I don't think I will be able to find another one anytime soon..

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve always preferred using an external monitor directly in front of me, with my MacBook Pro on a stand to the left as a secondary screen.\n\nRecently, I noticed some people placing their laptop directly in front of their external monitor and working like that. Why do they do it? Is it more comfortable?\n\nThe only clear advantage I see is that you can easily use the built-in keyboard and trackpad without needing external peripherals.\n\nAre there other benefits to this setup that I‚Äôm missing?\n\n**UPDATE**:\n\nThe problem is: I spend more time working at home than outside, and putting an external monitor behind the laptop usually means it‚Äôs not at eye level. Which can put strain to your neck and eyes.\n\nWould it be better to:\n\n* Raise the external monitor so its top edge aligns with eye level, or\n* Place the external monitor to the left and keep the MacBook‚Äôs internal screen as the main display?\n\nWhich setup works best ergonomically? Or maybe is there a better alternative? Perhaps buy smaller external monitor?\n\nIt is such a waste to not use the delivered Macbook Pro's keyboard and trackpad and sometimes not utilizing the webcam when opting for external monitor being the main driver.",

Why do they do it? Is it more comfortable?\n\nThe only clear advantage I see is that you can easily use the built-in keyboard and trackpad without needing external peripherals.\n\nAre there other benefits to this setup that I‚Äôm missing?\n\n**UPDATE**:\n\nThe problem is: I spend more time working at home than outside, and putting an external monitor behind the laptop usually means it‚Äôs not at eye level. Which can put strain to your neck and eyes.\n\nWould it be better to:\n\n* Raise the external monitor so its top edge aligns with eye level, or\n* Place the external monitor to the left and keep the MacBook‚Äôs internal screen as the main display?\n\nWhich setup works best ergonomically? Or maybe is there a better alternative? Perhaps buy smaller external monitor?\n\nIt is such a waste to not use the delivered Macbook Pro's keyboard and trackpad and sometimes not utilizing the webcam when opting for external monitor being the main driver.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve always preferred using an external monitor directly in front of me, with my MacBook Pro on a stand to the left as a secondary screen.\n\nRecently, I noticed some people placing their laptop directly in front of their external monitor and working like that. Why do they do it? Is it more comfortable?\n\nThe only clear advantage I see is that you can easily use the built-in keyboard and trackpad without needing external peripherals.\n\nAre there other benefits to this setup that I‚Äôm missing?\n\n**UPDATE**:\n\nThe problem is: I spend more time working at home than outside, and putting an external monitor behind the laptop usually means it‚Äôs not at eye level. Which can put strain to your neck and eyes.\n\nWould it be better to:\n\n* Raise the external monitor so its top edge aligns with eye level, or\n* Place the external monitor to the left and keep the MacBook‚Äôs internal screen as the main display?\n\nWhich setup works best ergonomically? Or maybe is there a better alternative? Perhaps buy smaller external monitor?\n\nIt is such a waste to not use the delivered Macbook Pro's keyboard and trackpad and sometimes not utilizing the webcam when opting for external monitor being the main driver.",

    "title": "thoughts and reviews of some light tactile switches",
    "selftext": "hey yall!\n\nfirst time posting in literal years! i wanted to share thoughts about the slew of light tactile switches that have come onto the market this year. there have, of course, been light tactile switch offerings in the past, but i didn't buy those, so i won't be talking about them lol\n\nfor some context, i've always enjoyed mx browns and pretty much use that as the base for all light tactile switches to compare against. i also have been using pewter switches, gateron cap browns, mode signals, and ttc gold v2s (lol they're somehow bad but good to me idk) as some of the other light tactile switches i rotate through (for better or for worse). on top of that, i enjoy the 45g topre boards (hhkb2, fc660c, rf tkl, and cm novatouch (rip)). so even though these aren't all the light tactile switches i have experience in, for the sake of this post, they are my points of reference.  \n\n'light tactile' is also a hard to pin kind of description because it can mean certain things to different people. so for the purposes of this post, when i say light tactile, what i mean specifically is that a) the bottom out weight is typically in the 50-60g range AND b) the tactile bump is small, a 'p' or 'b' shaped bump depending on when and where the tactility starts. some people only refer to one or the other, so this is what i'm basing my thoughts on. \n\nthe switches i'll be writing about will have quick and dirty typing videos taken with an iphone 15 (and posted on imgur) so this is a big ass disclaimer that they haven't been recorded for any scientific consistencies or best audio/environment considerations or to even compare the switches to each other, specifically. they're just snapshots of how they sound inside the boards i've installed them in so ymmv. they may wildly differ in sound and feel to you on your boards. so just fyi, please and thanks.\n\nalso, i paid with all of these with my own money and am just a hobbyist returning to the community with thoughts on new switches that's making keebs fun again for me.\n\nhmx bleeds and bruises\n\n>these are basically twins with nary a difference between them save for .3mm of travel, at least according to milktooth's website. they are fun to type on. they're light and they sound bright and clacky. they're my first foray into using hmx switches (since up to this point they've only had linears) and i think that they are great intros to both hmx and/or to light tactile switches. they're lighter in weight than mx browns but they don't suffer for it. they are enjoyable to get into a long typing session (and fast too! the bruises i type in jumped to 160wpm for the 30sec typing test without even meaning to!). i pretty much immediately put them onto boards as soon as i got them and they have yet to disappoint. i co-sign a lot of the reviews these have gotten and i think deserve a bit of their hype. i enjoy how gentle the tactile bump is because i typically like to feel just enough friction when i'm typing but without how typo-prone i get with linears, even after i've gotten used to the board. overall, solid sets of switches and i recommend them for their feel, sound, and price point. at time of writing, on milktooth's site, they're both $0.42/each, so $4.20 for 10pcs. i find this price reasonable. the naming and color scheme are also quite clever so i would def give them points for that.\n\n>[hmx bleeds typing sounds on neo ergo](https://imgur.com/XGOIh6z) (aluminum case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\n>[hmx bruises typing sounds on mode 2022 sonnet](https://imgur.com/XyaAFlJ) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, top mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nhmx k01 \n\n>these and the akko bittersweets are the closest to mx browns by feel out of all the switches on this lineup and for that i quite enjoy them. they're a good pick for those who want a 'better' and 'more refined' version of an mx brown (no mods required, smooth, no scratchiness, etc -- even tho tbf, cherry has upped their game in their mx2a or hyperglides). i like the characteristics of mx browns but for those who might not want the effort involved in 'improving' on them, k01s are nice out of the box. the sound is clackier than mx browns to me, unsurprising of hmx's signature sound profile. at time of writing, on milktooth's website, they go for $0.35/each which is a pretty good value overall, definitely cheaper than bleeds and bruises or mx browns ($0.40/each on milktooth, but you may have better luck elsewhere. omnitype for example has them for $0.35/each but they come in packages of 35pcs instead of 10pcs). \n\n>[hmx k01 typing sounds on mode tempo](https://imgur.com/6rEOJY0) (aluminum case, copper plate, copper weight, gasket mount, no foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nakko bittersweets\n\n>i was most fascinated with these because of a few things. they are a departure in sound from hmx, promising a subtler and thockier sound profile. according to akko's website, not only are they the tactile counterpart to akko rosewoods (thocky linears), they also describe its name based on the sound and feel that someone might feel about them: \"[This bump is light that it might sometimes go unnoticed, producing a ‚Äúbittersweet‚Äù mixed impression./The sound and feel might be ‚Äúbitter‚Äù for some, yet ‚Äúsweet‚Äù for others.](https://en.akkogear.com/product/bittersweet-switch-lubed/)\" which i thought was pretty neat as i'm sure there are people who would feel that way about them. they are comfortable and they are flatter in sound in the polygon-7 but in a pleasant way. overall, i'm getting good mileage out of them and would find them an easy rec for their value. i know there are akko cilantros that many people enjoy because of its stronger tactility and lighter weight, but i think bittersweets are more for me because of the smaller bump -- but disclaimer, i do not have akko cilantros and have never felt them. but based on reading comments, they feel like they're a gentler version of the cilantros. at time of writing, they're $15 for 45pcs or $0.33/each on amazon, which is what i paid. the akko website has 90pcs for $28 or $0.31/each. \n\n>[akko bittersweet typing sounds on daringrun polygon-7](https://imgur.com/2FVf4fh) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, gasket mount, plate foam, mda profile pbt keycaps)\n\ngateron mini i and gateron weightlessness\n\n>got these from the ikasaya closeout sale and i'd heard decent things about them so i thought i'd give them a try. the differences at least on the ikasaya website lists weightlessness as having a \"light to medium bump\" whereas mini i has a \"gentle tactile bump.\" i think if bleeds/bruises are twin sisters, then these are siblings close in age. the difference between them is that the weightlessness's tactile bump is a smidgen more pronounced and bounces back a bit more noticeably, for me, than the mini i. but that's when i'm taking the time to press down on them. for regular typing, the differences are negligible. overall, their typing experiences are quite pleasant and fall in line nicely with the rest of the switches i've mentioned here. at time of writing, from the ikasaya closeout sale, i got the gateron mini i for $37.50 for 90 switches, so about $0.42/each. in other places, they go for $0.60/each or $6 for 10pcs at milktooth and $10.80 for 18pcs at kineticlabs. as for the weightlessness, they were $40.10 for 90 switches, so about $0.45/each. on amazon, they go for $23.99 for 35pcs, so $0.69/each which is not as budget friendly as the other options here, though it does show a 10% coupon upon purchase. milktooth right now has a sale on them for $5.50 for 10pcs so $0.55/each. lumekeebs also offers the same $0.55/each. respectable price point at the discount, but i don't know if they're worth it above that.\n\n>[gateron mini i typing sounds on monsgeek mg75w](https://imgur.com/96YsEx6) (plastic case and plate, tray mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)  \n[gateron weightlessness typing sounds on keychron v1 max](https://imgur.com/AqW3JB2) (plastic case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, osa profile pbt keycaps)\n\n[typing sounds playlist link](https://imgur.com/a/light-tactile-switches-typing-sounds-N1VjrJg) (imgur album)\n\nif i were to order them in light tactility in the context of mx browns as my center, then it goes as follows: hmx bleeds/bruises, akko bittersweets, mx browns, hmx k01, gateron mini i, gateron weightlessness. \n\nin sum, i'm quite satisfied with this cohort of light tactiles. these switches are great out of the box, need no modification, and are great switches for those who want to try them out as well as for those who already enjoy light tactiles. i feel good recommending them, but of course, your experiences and preferences are your own and up to your own curation and determination. i'm a happy typist with these switches and glad that the rest of my light tactile collection have good company. i look forward to rotating them with each other and on different boards than how they're configured at the moment but for now, i'm enjoying how each one feels on the boards i've chosen for them. \n\nfeel free to talk about your experiences or suggestions of other light tactiles you enjoy as well as ask questions or chat about these. thanks a bunch for reading! \n\n",

Was using the Glove80 up until I received the Imprint. While I found the Glove80 to be a great keyboard, there were just a few missing features that I wanted, like hot-swappable switches, MX switches, and the integrated trackballs.\n\nInstalled Durock Ice King switches and clear polycarbonate keycaps. Replaced the default black trackballs with Perixx PeriPro-303 purple and green trackballs. I was eyeing the sport balls trackballs from Perixx but they are very expensive.\n\nOrdered the Nylon + Aluminium material, with 5-rows and 5 full bottom row keys. Got the wider palm rest with Bamboo inserts. While the Imprint was made with XDA compatibility in mind, I found that they do fit the tallest Cherry profile keycaps. I am thinking of trying Full metal or ceramic keycaps in the future if they offer all 1u keys.\n\nSome other photos showing the build process. The last photo shows the weight mod I have done, adding an extra 200g of weight to each palm rest, bringing the weight of each palm rest to 270g. I have also did a tape mod and added Poron foam inside the case.",

    "selftext": "I bought a K6 non-pro about a week and a half ago to replace a Logitech membrane keyboards I was getting tired of. While I originally thought to keep it stock I thought I'd make it pop a little. I'm still using the stock keycaps ..and I tossed the gateron blues in it for browns pro v3, though I do have some milky yellow and green apples waiting for something.\n\nWhen I got the board my only intention was to just add the foam to the case, clip the stem feet on the stabs and do a tape mod. Oddly enough the feet on the stabs were already cut despite this being bought new so it saved me on that as it was decently lubed with no rattle or ticking on any stabilizer.\n\nI ended up painting the aluminum pieces. I used chalk paint ..and while it came out okay, it didn't adhere as well as I wanted to as corners had a harder time even after lightly sanding the bare pieces to grab the paint and finish but either way ..good enough cause I don't have a sprayer to have done it differently to get a more consistent finish. I stayed with the stock keycaps as I feel they contrast well with the muted green (pic doesn't do the color justice it's a little more muted like a matcha green color). Unfortunately, I'm skin allergic to pbt so I'm limited to ABS options ..I'm not particularly fond of the polycarbonate keycap sound.\n\nAt the time I was working on this I came across the weikav lucky65 v2 which in waiting to arrive soon. I ended up getting a barebones version along with a set of gmk double shot ABS nightshade clones. So this K6 might end up being shortlived on my desk and live more with my portable devices. I originally wanted to go with gazzew U4T with the lucky65, but unfortunately thanks to tariffs I'd rather wait it out and will instead be pairing it with either the milky yellow or the green apple switches.",

I even had the Apollo MT3 version back then, thinking I would build one for it soon. But eventually had to sell the keycaps for other reasons. \n\nFast forward to today, bought the ice blue Evoworks Evo75 and paired it with MiTo GMK Godspeed keycaps and deskmat. \n\nI haven't been keeping up with this hobby for a long time now but I can't believe pre-built keyboards are built this way nowadays. Simply amazing üëå\n\nThank you, Evoworks and for everyone who's keeping this hobby alive and going. From old timers to new timers, all love üíØ\n\n",

However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup. The library was recently remodeled, and there is also plenty of (free) garage parking next to it.\n\nLooking forward to folks coming out!  \n  \nAlso, thanks yet again to [u/outragedpudding](https://www.reddit.com/user/outragedpudding/) for designing a fabulous [banner](http://i.imgur.com/cpqlgsZ.jpg)!",

Interchanged the switches and that made it better for maybe a couple days and then back to the faulty behavior. since i was out of warranty there is was nothing for me to do in that department. My dad saw my frustration and gave me his keyboard since his work barely needs him to use a computer barely if at all.\n\nI brushed it off as dumb luck and moved on, last month the warranty expired on the new one and low and behold the second keyboard has found the same fate.\n\nOut of desperation, i soldered the switches to the PCB and that worked for a bit but after about 10 days i find myself back on square-one.\n\nI didn't want this to be rant on Keychron but it is very frustrating, especially given how expensive the keyboards are, about 9500 INR.\n\nAlso, would like to disclose I do not have any conflict of interest, meagerly an under-satisfied customer who was very enthusiastic for his new keyboard :( ",

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn‚Äôt even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn‚Äôt expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

    "selftext": "https://reddit.com/link/1ohqnll/video/3yg1upjhypxf1/player\n\nI made my first switch customization to my ZSA Moonlander Mark 1, and I love it. I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

    "title": "[RULES UPDATE] Media Only Post, Typing Apps, Games, and Extensions, Combatting Spam",
    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "title": "thoughts and reviews of some light tactile switches",
    "selftext": "hey yall!\n\nfirst time posting in literal years! i wanted to share thoughts about the slew of light tactile switches that have come onto the market this year. there have, of course, been light tactile switch offerings in the past, but i didn't buy those, so i won't be talking about them lol\n\nfor some context, i've always enjoyed mx browns and pretty much use that as the base for all light tactile switches to compare against. i also have been using pewter switches, gateron cap browns, mode signals, and ttc gold v2s (lol they're somehow bad but good to me idk) as some of the other light tactile switches i rotate through (for better or for worse). on top of that, i enjoy the 45g topre boards (hhkb2, fc660c, rf tkl, and cm novatouch (rip)). so even though these aren't all the light tactile switches i have experience in, for the sake of this post, they are my points of reference.  \n\n'light tactile' is also a hard to pin kind of description because it can mean certain things to different people. so for the purposes of this post, when i say light tactile, what i mean specifically is that a) the bottom out weight is typically in the 50-60g range AND b) the tactile bump is small, a 'p' or 'b' shaped bump depending on when and where the tactility starts. some people only refer to one or the other, so this is what i'm basing my thoughts on. \n\nthe switches i'll be writing about will have quick and dirty typing videos taken with an iphone 15 (and posted on imgur) so this is a big ass disclaimer that they haven't been recorded for any scientific consistencies or best audio/environment considerations or to even compare the switches to each other, specifically. they're just snapshots of how they sound inside the boards i've installed them in so ymmv. they may wildly differ in sound and feel to you on your boards. so just fyi, please and thanks.\n\nalso, i paid with all of these with my own money and am just a hobbyist returning to the community with thoughts on new switches that's making keebs fun again for me.\n\nhmx bleeds and bruises\n\n>these are basically twins with nary a difference between them save for .3mm of travel, at least according to milktooth's website. they are fun to type on. they're light and they sound bright and clacky. they're my first foray into using hmx switches (since up to this point they've only had linears) and i think that they are great intros to both hmx and/or to light tactile switches. they're lighter in weight than mx browns but they don't suffer for it. they are enjoyable to get into a long typing session (and fast too! the bruises i type in jumped to 160wpm for the 30sec typing test without even meaning to!). i pretty much immediately put them onto boards as soon as i got them and they have yet to disappoint. i co-sign a lot of the reviews these have gotten and i think deserve a bit of their hype. i enjoy how gentle the tactile bump is because i typically like to feel just enough friction when i'm typing but without how typo-prone i get with linears, even after i've gotten used to the board. overall, solid sets of switches and i recommend them for their feel, sound, and price point. at time of writing, on milktooth's site, they're both $0.42/each, so $4.20 for 10pcs. i find this price reasonable. the naming and color scheme are also quite clever so i would def give them points for that.\n\n>[hmx bleeds typing sounds on neo ergo](https://imgur.com/XGOIh6z) (aluminum case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\n>[hmx bruises typing sounds on mode 2022 sonnet](https://imgur.com/XyaAFlJ) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, top mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nhmx k01 \n\n>these and the akko bittersweets are the closest to mx browns by feel out of all the switches on this lineup and for that i quite enjoy them. they're a good pick for those who want a 'better' and 'more refined' version of an mx brown (no mods required, smooth, no scratchiness, etc -- even tho tbf, cherry has upped their game in their mx2a or hyperglides). i like the characteristics of mx browns but for those who might not want the effort involved in 'improving' on them, k01s are nice out of the box. the sound is clackier than mx browns to me, unsurprising of hmx's signature sound profile. at time of writing, on milktooth's website, they go for $0.35/each which is a pretty good value overall, definitely cheaper than bleeds and bruises or mx browns ($0.40/each on milktooth, but you may have better luck elsewhere. omnitype for example has them for $0.35/each but they come in packages of 35pcs instead of 10pcs). \n\n>[hmx k01 typing sounds on mode tempo](https://imgur.com/6rEOJY0) (aluminum case, copper plate, copper weight, gasket mount, no foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nakko bittersweets\n\n>i was most fascinated with these because of a few things. they are a departure in sound from hmx, promising a subtler and thockier sound profile. according to akko's website, not only are they the tactile counterpart to akko rosewoods (thocky linears), they also describe its name based on the sound and feel that someone might feel about them: \"[This bump is light that it might sometimes go unnoticed, producing a ‚Äúbittersweet‚Äù mixed impression./The sound and feel might be ‚Äúbitter‚Äù for some, yet ‚Äúsweet‚Äù for others.](https://en.akkogear.com/product/bittersweet-switch-lubed/)\" which i thought was pretty neat as i'm sure there are people who would feel that way about them. they are comfortable and they are flatter in sound in the polygon-7 but in a pleasant way. overall, i'm getting good mileage out of them and would find them an easy rec for their value. i know there are akko cilantros that many people enjoy because of its stronger tactility and lighter weight, but i think bittersweets are more for me because of the smaller bump -- but disclaimer, i do not have akko cilantros and have never felt them. but based on reading comments, they feel like they're a gentler version of the cilantros. at time of writing, they're $15 for 45pcs or $0.33/each on amazon, which is what i paid. the akko website has 90pcs for $28 or $0.31/each. \n\n>[akko bittersweet typing sounds on daringrun polygon-7](https://imgur.com/2FVf4fh) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, gasket mount, plate foam, mda profile pbt keycaps)\n\ngateron mini i and gateron weightlessness\n\n>got these from the ikasaya closeout sale and i'd heard decent things about them so i thought i'd give them a try. the differences at least on the ikasaya website lists weightlessness as having a \"light to medium bump\" whereas mini i has a \"gentle tactile bump.\" i think if bleeds/bruises are twin sisters, then these are siblings close in age. the difference between them is that the weightlessness's tactile bump is a smidgen more pronounced and bounces back a bit more noticeably, for me, than the mini i. but that's when i'm taking the time to press down on them. for regular typing, the differences are negligible. overall, their typing experiences are quite pleasant and fall in line nicely with the rest of the switches i've mentioned here. at time of writing, from the ikasaya closeout sale, i got the gateron mini i for $37.50 for 90 switches, so about $0.42/each. in other places, they go for $0.60/each or $6 for 10pcs at milktooth and $10.80 for 18pcs at kineticlabs. as for the weightlessness, they were $40.10 for 90 switches, so about $0.45/each. on amazon, they go for $23.99 for 35pcs, so $0.69/each which is not as budget friendly as the other options here, though it does show a 10% coupon upon purchase. milktooth right now has a sale on them for $5.50 for 10pcs so $0.55/each. lumekeebs also offers the same $0.55/each. respectable price point at the discount, but i don't know if they're worth it above that.\n\n>[gateron mini i typing sounds on monsgeek mg75w](https://imgur.com/96YsEx6) (plastic case and

browns as my center, then it goes as follows: hmx bleeds/bruises, akko bittersweets, mx browns, hmx k01, gateron mini i, gateron weightlessness. \n\nin sum, i'm quite satisfied with this cohort of light tactiles. these switches are great out of the box, need no modification, and are great switches for those who want to try them out as well as for those who already enjoy light tactiles. i feel good recommending them, but of course, your experiences and preferences are your own and up to your own curation and determination. i'm a happy typist with these switches and glad that the rest of my light tactile collection have good company. i look forward to rotating them with each other and on different boards than how they're configured at the moment but for now, i'm enjoying how each one feels on the boards i've chosen for them. \n\nfeel free to talk about your experiences or suggestions of other light tactiles you enjoy as well as ask questions or chat about these. thanks a bunch for reading! \n\n",

    "selftext": "Finally got my Imprint after 2 months of wait. Started my split journey with a Moonlander, moved on to a Glove80, tried the Silakka54 and Corne in between before getting the Imprint. Was using the Glove80 up until I received the Imprint. While I found the Glove80 to be a great keyboard, there were just a few missing features that I wanted, like hot-swappable switches, MX switches, and the integrated trackballs.\n\nInstalled Durock Ice King switches and clear polycarbonate keycaps. Replaced the default black trackballs with Perixx PeriPro-303 purple and green trackballs. I was eyeing the sport balls trackballs from Perixx but they are very expensive.\n\nOrdered the Nylon + Aluminium material, with 5-rows and 5 full bottom row keys. Got the wider palm rest with Bamboo inserts. While the Imprint was made with XDA compatibility in mind, I found that they do fit the tallest Cherry profile keycaps. I am thinking of trying Full metal or ceramic keycaps in the future if they offer all 1u keys.\n\nSome other photos showing the build process. The last photo shows the weight mod I have done, adding an extra 200g of weight to each palm rest, bringing the weight of each palm rest to 270g. I have also did a tape mod and added Poron foam inside the case.",

While I originally thought to keep it stock I thought I'd make it pop a little. I'm still using the stock keycaps ..and I tossed the gateron blues in it for browns pro v3, though I do have some milky yellow and green apples waiting for something.\n\nWhen I got the board my only intention was to just add the foam to the case, clip the stem feet on the stabs and do a tape mod. Oddly enough the feet on the stabs were already cut despite this being bought new so it saved me on that as it was decently lubed with no rattle or ticking on any stabilizer.\n\nI ended up painting the aluminum pieces. I used chalk paint ..and while it came out okay, it didn't adhere as well as I wanted to as corners had a harder time even after lightly sanding the bare pieces to grab the paint and finish but either way ..good enough cause I don't have a sprayer to have done it differently to get a more consistent finish. I stayed with the stock keycaps as I feel they contrast well with the muted green (pic doesn't do the color justice it's a little more muted like a matcha green color). Unfortunately, I'm skin allergic to pbt so I'm limited to ABS options ..I'm not particularly fond of the polycarbonate keycap sound.\n\nAt the time I was working on this I came across the weikav lucky65 v2 which in waiting to arrive soon. I ended up getting a barebones version along with a set of gmk double shot ABS nightshade clones. So this K6 might end up being shortlived on my desk and live more with my portable devices. I originally wanted to go with gazzew U4T with the lucky65, but unfortunately thanks to tariffs I'd rather wait it out and will instead be pairing it with either the milky yellow or the green apple switches.",

High St., Dublin, OH 43017)  \nDiscord: [Ohio MK](https://discord.gg/YmPypPj)\n\nWe've been in a bit of a scramble since our previous venue shut down, but thankfully we were able to pull something together before the end of the year!\n\n**No tickets are required**, thanks to the library having a free space for us to use. However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup. The library was recently remodeled, and there is also plenty of (free) garage parking next to it.\n\nLooking forward to folks coming out!  \n  \nAlso, thanks yet again to [u/outragedpudding](https://www.reddit.com/user/outragedpudding/) for designing a fabulous [banner](http://i.imgur.com/cpqlgsZ.jpg)!",

    "title": "thoughts and reviews of some light tactile switches",
    "selftext": "hey yall!\n\nfirst time posting in literal years! i wanted to share thoughts about the slew of light tactile switches that have come onto the market this year. there have, of course, been light tactile switch offerings in the past, but i didn't buy those, so i won't be talking about them lol\n\nfor some context, i've always enjoyed mx browns and pretty much use that as the base for all light tactile switches to compare against. i also have been using pewter switches, gateron cap browns, mode signals, and ttc gold v2s (lol they're somehow bad but good to me idk) as some of the other light tactile switches i rotate through (for better or for worse). on top of that, i enjoy the 45g topre boards (hhkb2, fc660c, rf tkl, and cm novatouch (rip)). so even though these aren't all the light tactile switches i have experience in, for the sake of this post, they are my points of reference.  \n\n'light tactile' is also a hard to pin kind of description because it can mean certain things to different people. so for the purposes of this post, when i say light tactile, what i mean specifically is that a) the bottom out weight is typically in the 50-60g range AND b) the tactile bump is small, a 'p' or 'b' shaped bump depending on when and where the tactility starts. some people only refer to one or the other, so this is what i'm basing my thoughts on. \n\nthe switches i'll be writing about will have quick and dirty typing videos taken with an iphone 15 (and posted on imgur) so this is a big ass disclaimer that they haven't been recorded for any scientific consistencies or best audio/environment considerations or to even compare the switches to each other, specifically. they're just snapshots of how they sound inside the boards i've installed them in so ymmv. they may wildly differ in sound and feel to you on your boards. so just fyi, please and thanks.\n\nalso, i paid with all of these with my own money and am just a hobbyist returning to the community with thoughts on new switches that's making keebs fun again for me.\n\nhmx bleeds and bruises\n\n>these are basically twins with nary a difference between them save for .3mm of travel, at least according to milktooth's website. they are fun to type on. they're light and they sound bright and clacky. they're my first foray into using hmx switches (since up to this point they've only had linears) and i think that they are great intros to both hmx and/or to light tactile switches. they're lighter in weight than mx browns but they don't suffer for it. they are enjoyable to get into a long typing session (and fast too! the bruises i type in jumped to 160wpm for the 30sec typing test without even meaning to!). i pretty much immediately put them onto boards as soon as i got them and they have yet to disappoint. i co-sign a lot of the reviews these have gotten and i think deserve a bit of their hype. i enjoy how gentle the tactile bump is because i typically like to feel just enough friction when i'm typing but without how typo-prone i get with linears, even after i've gotten used to the board. overall, solid sets of switches and i recommend them for their feel, sound, and price point. at time of writing, on milktooth's site, they're both $0.42/each, so $4.20 for 10pcs. i find this price reasonable. the naming and color scheme are also quite clever so i would def give them points for that.\n\n>[hmx bleeds typing sounds on neo ergo](https://imgur.com/XGOIh6z) (aluminum case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\n>[hmx bruises typing sounds on mode 2022 sonnet](https://imgur.com/XyaAFlJ) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, top mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nhmx k01 \n\n>these and the akko bittersweets are the closest to mx browns by feel out of all the switches on this lineup and for that i quite enjoy them. they're a good pick for those who want a 'better' and 'more refined' version of an mx brown (no mods required, smooth, no scratchiness, etc -- even tho tbf, cherry has upped their game in their mx2a or hyperglides). i like the characteristics of mx browns but for those who might not want the effort involved in 'improving' on them, k01s are nice out of the box. the sound is clackier than mx browns to me, unsurprising of hmx's signature sound profile. at time of writing, on milktooth's website, they go for $0.35/each which is a pretty good value overall, definitely cheaper than bleeds and bruises or mx browns ($0.40/each on milktooth, but you may have better luck elsewhere. omnitype for example has them for $0.35/each but they come in packages of 35pcs instead of 10pcs). \n\n>[hmx k01 typing sounds on mode tempo](https://imgur.com/6rEOJY0) (aluminum case, copper plate, copper weight, gasket mount, no foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nakko bittersweets\n\n>i was most fascinated with these because of a few things. they are a departure in sound from hmx, promising a subtler and thockier sound profile. according to akko's website, not only are they the tactile counterpart to akko rosewoods (thocky linears), they also describe its name based on the sound and feel that someone might feel about them: \"[This bump is light that it might sometimes go unnoticed, producing a ‚Äúbittersweet‚Äù mixed impression./The sound and feel might be ‚Äúbitter‚Äù for some, yet ‚Äúsweet‚Äù for others.](https://en.akkogear.com/product/bittersweet-switch-lubed/)\" which i thought was pretty neat as i'm sure there are people who would feel that way about them. they are comfortable and they are flatter in sound in the polygon-7 but in a pleasant way. overall, i'm getting good mileage out of them and would find them an easy rec for their value. i know there are akko cilantros that many people enjoy because of its stronger tactility and lighter weight, but i think bittersweets are more for me because of the smaller bump -- but disclaimer, i do not have akko cilantros and have never felt them. but based on reading comments, they feel like they're a gentler version of the cilantros. at time of writing, they're $15 for 45pcs or $0.33/each on amazon, which is what i paid. the akko website has 90pcs for $28 or $0.31/each. \n\n>[akko bittersweet typing sounds on daringrun polygon-7](https://imgur.com/2FVf4fh) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, gasket mount, plate foam, mda profile pbt keycaps)\n\ngateron mini i and gateron weightlessness\n\n>got these from the ikasaya closeout sale and i'd heard decent things about them so i thought i'd give them a try. the differences at least on the ikasaya website lists weightlessness as having a \"light to medium bump\" whereas mini i has a \"gentle tactile bump.\" i think if bleeds/bruises are twin sisters, then these are siblings close in age. the difference between them is that the weightlessness's tactile bump is a smidgen more pronounced and bounces back a bit more noticeably, for me, than the mini i. but that's when i'm taking the time to press down on them. for regular typing, the differences are negligible. overall, their typing experiences are quite pleasant and fall in line nicely with the rest of the switches i've mentioned here. at time of writing, from the ikasaya closeout sale, i got the gateron mini i for $37.50 for 90 switches, so about $0.42/each. in other places, they go for $0.60/each or $6 for 10pcs at milktooth and $10.80 for 18pcs at kineticlabs. as for the weightlessness, they were $40.10 for 90 switches, so about $0.45/each. on amazon, they go for $23.99 for 35pcs, so $0.69/each which is not as budget friendly as the other options here, though it does show a 10% coupon upon purchase. milktooth right now has a sale on them for $5.50 for 10pcs so $0.55/each. lumekeebs also offers the same $0.55/each. respectable price point at the discount, but i don't know if they're worth it above that.\n\n>[gateron mini i typing sounds on monsgeek mg75w](https://imgur.com/96YsEx6) (plastic case and plate, tray mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)  \n[gateron weightlessness typing sounds on keychron v1 max](https://imgur.com/AqW3JB2) (plastic case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, osa profile pbt keycaps)\n\n[typing sounds playlist link](https://imgur.com/a/light-tactile-switches-typing-sounds-N1VjrJg) (imgur album)\n\nif i were to order them in light tactility in the context of mx browns as my center, then it goes as follows: hmx bleeds/bruises, akko bittersweets, mx browns, hmx k01, gateron mini i, gateron weightlessness. \n\nin sum, i'm quite satisfied with this cohort of light tactiles. these switches are great out of the box, need no modification, and are great switches for those who want to try them out as well as for those who already enjoy light tactiles. i feel good recommending them, but of course, your experiences and preferences are your own and up to your own curation and determination. i'm a happy typist with these switches and glad that the rest of my light tactile collection have good company. i look forward to rotating them with each other and on different boards than how they're configured at the moment but for now, i'm enjoying how each one feels on the boards i've chosen for them. \n\nfeel free to talk about your experiences or suggestions of other light tactiles you enjoy as well as ask questions or chat about these. thanks a bunch for reading! \n\n",

    "selftext": "Finally got my Imprint after 2 months of wait. Started my split journey with a Moonlander, moved on to a Glove80, tried the Silakka54 and Corne in between before getting the Imprint. Was using the Glove80 up until I received the Imprint. While I found the Glove80 to be a great keyboard, there were just a few missing features that I wanted, like hot-swappable switches, MX switches, and the integrated trackballs.\n\nInstalled Durock Ice King switches and clear polycarbonate keycaps. Replaced the default black trackballs with Perixx PeriPro-303 purple and green trackballs. I was eyeing the sport balls trackballs from Perixx but they are very expensive.\n\nOrdered the Nylon + Aluminium material, with 5-rows and 5 full bottom row keys. Got the wider palm rest with Bamboo inserts. While the Imprint was made with XDA compatibility in mind, I found that they do fit the tallest Cherry profile keycaps. I am thinking of trying Full metal or ceramic keycaps in the future if they offer all 1u keys.\n\nSome other photos showing the build process. The last photo shows the weight mod I have done, adding an extra 200g of weight to each palm rest, bringing the weight of each palm rest to 270g. I have also did a tape mod and added Poron foam inside the case.",

Could you please provide me with the best option for an OLED display for my build? And if possible, elaborate on that?\n\nThank you in advance !\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "AOC Q27G40XMN Dilemma",
    "selftext": "Hey all, grabbed a Q27G40XMN today on sale at Best Buy. It's got a manufactured date of 5/25. I got it set up and I've spent the last hour and a half or so trying to discern if it has the firmware bugs and if so how severe they are.\n\nI *think* it does have the bug, or at least a form of it. As described, when I've enabled displayhdr + strong local dimming at some point and then switched back to SDR + strong local dimming, I can see that the color of the AOC logo on the OSD has slightly shifted hues from orange, to a slight yellow-orange/orange-yellow. The difference is subtle, but noticeable if you are looking for it. \n\nWhat I will say is that I'm curious if this is potentially even a partially fixed firmware version where this bug is much less pronounced. The difference between the bugged state of SDR + strong local dimming and the normal state right after a monitor reset is so subtle that, as far as I've seen, I can literally only notice it on the OSD. I don't know if it's just that I've never had an HDR monitor before, but to me I'm having trouble seeing an issue even though the OSD looks like it's bugged. DisplayHDR looks excellent to me, SDR looks excellent to me, even the bugged state of SDR + strong local dimming looks excellent to me. \n\nMy questions would be this:\n\n1. Is the firmware bug believed to significantly impact the performance DisplayHDR + strong local dimming mode? If so, should it be bad enough that I can notice it with an untrained eye?\n\n2. Does anyone have ideas on ways to test more objectively to see if whatever version of this monitor firmware I have is performing acceptably in actual content and not just on the OSD? The only idea I have so far is to compare some test videos and colors to my only other HDR device, my iPhone, to see if there are any colors that are noticeably washed out on my monitor.\n\nLuckily it's Best Buy, so I should be in a position to easily return the monitor if I end up wanting to. The tough part is, I haven't been able to visibly see any issues outside of the OSD. If I hadn't read up on this issue in detail, I'm not sure that I ever would have noticed it. It's tough to jump straight to boxing it back up and returning it when the only way I can tell there's something wrong is looking at the OSD in the \"bugged\" state. \n\nI'm going to spend a day or so gaming with it and trying to find HDR content to really push a wide range of super bright content through it. Maybe I will come across something that makes it quite clear that there's an issue, and I'll update this if I do. With it being on sale and looking unbelievably good for $250, I think I could live with this version of the issue if the HDR performance doesn't disappoint, so I guess I'll try as much HDR content consumption as I can and see how I feel.\n\nAnyone else had a similar experience?",

    "selftext": "This is an example of how mini led in blackout mode is able to eat up details in very dark scenes. Black spot on crosshair is fully black. Please note that increasing the shadow lightening by only 2 points will bring back the detail.\n\nMy monitor has two dynamic backlight modes. The images in the photo do not reflect how  see the image on the monitor. These are hypertrophied photos taken at 800 ISO and at 50% and 1600 ISO at 100% brightness (to even out the brightness level in the photo, at least a little bit). The shutter speed in all photos is 0.8 seconds. Ignore the blurriness due to the tremor.\n\nDimming mode do not produce visible blooming or other artifacts, but could hide some details in near pitch-black scenes. Blooming mode trying focus to brightening every even smallest bright details, which increases brightness overall and don't touch black details. But it produces visible blooming around objects accompanied by inverted blooming.\n\nConclusion: Mini-LED mediocre of keeping details in dark scenes, working in high dimming mode. I can assure you that the details are preserved in the Medium dimming mode, slightly reducing the contrast (it's perfect for low brightness).\n\nThis is not a hate post. Mini-LED backlight monitors has a right to exist and these are literally some of the best monitors that are quite capable of competing with OLED and even surpassing them in other scenarios.",

I currently have an Alienware 32\" AW3225QF 4K 240Hz (right) and recently bought an ASUS 32\" XG32UCDM 4K 165Hz to use as my second monitor.\n\nMy question: should I return the ASUS on the left and replace it with my old Gigabyte M32U 4K 144Hz IPS monitor or keep it and sell the M32U? I'm looking for versatile use with gaming and productivity. I heard text clarity isn't as good on the OLED monitors, but to be honest I've been working on the Alienware for about a year now and notice no issues. Here are my use cases below:\n\n1. Gaming on one monitor\n\n2. Working on both monitors for my job. This would entail coding on the right monitor and probably more coding or documentation open on the left monitor. Sometimes there could be static pages left on screen. I don't see any benefit of an OLED in this case.\n\n3. Side projects on my PC or game development (Unity/Unreal Engine). The only use case I see for an OLED is if I was using Photoshop or Blender on the second monitor for anything while having UE open on the other, but would an OLED make a difference or be worth it in this case? \n\nThank you in advance for the answers.\n",

It was totally fine yesterday and last night but today I turn it on and it kept cutting out. It wouldn't stay on for more than a few seconds. My second monitor is working just fine and I've had no issues with it at all since this started so I don't think it's my PC.\n\nI updated all my drivers and that did nothing. I unplugged everything, plugged it back in with brand new cables. That helped ... a little bit. The screen still kept going static-y for lack of a better word and it kept cutting out for several seconds at a time.\n\nI turned it off and back on, I unplugged the monitor both from the socket and from the monitor itself, plugged everything back in, issue persisted. I use the same monitor for my PS5 as well so I switched it over, turned that on, it worked flawlessly.\n\nFinally go back to my PC, change the refresh rate from 120 to 100. Nothing. Down to 60 and now it's totally fine.\n\nAnd, again, the entire time this has been going on my secondary monitor has been totally fine. No issues with it at all. It's chugging along as normal.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on what to do or try? 60 hz is brutal so I don't want to be stuck with this for very long and I can't afford a new monitor at the moment and I can't use the secondary one to game on (it's a cheapy little $70 monitor that's not really good for more than Discord, Spotify, and YouTube if I want to put on a video or something while I'm playing something chill) so I'd really like to get this figured out if possible.",

It's also 24'', which is my preferred size for a monitor. Only problem is that this monitor doesn't seem to be available for a sensible price in my country (Sweden), and neither is its closest competitor Asus vg259qm.\n\nBest options seem to be:\n-Asus vg249qm1a: Seems to be a slightly smaller version of the vg259qm with 270hz instead of 280hz. Haven't seen any in depth reviews of it, and it seems like it's actually a 240hz monitor with an overclock feature to 270hz. In my experience, usually when a cheaper monitor has an overclock feaure it is dogshit, but the standard refreshrate of 240hz is still good enough.\n\n-AOC 25g4sxu: Again a monitor that is sometimes advertised as a 300hz monitor but is actually just a 240hz monitor with an overclock feature. This one I have actually seen a pretty good review of and it seems like it's a good option for 240hz but the overclock feature should really be ignored. This is probably my favourite option so far since I know pretty much what I'll be getting. Would kinda suck if my 2 other options are better so that's why I'm making this post, to see if any of you nerds have any more info.\n\n-MSI mag 255xf: a 300hz monitor that I don't really know anything about.\n\nWhich one do you think I should go for?\n\n\n ",

Also, no embedded frame generation/interpolation technologies would be better (I would like to be able to program the displayed video frame by frame).\n* Screen size : quite open, anything from 24\" to way above would work, but 27-42 inches would be a sweet spot.\n\nI have had a hard time finding a monitor satisfying both requirements, as most modern 3D screens come with either glasses-free or active 3D approaches, which are not suitable for my application. I think LG might be the most promising brand, as they seem to have worked a lot on passive 3D a few years ago, but I am having difficulties to find older references online, and am not too sure what the refresh rates advertised refer to (TruMotion for example, might be an embedded frame interpolation tech). \n\nI am open to old/discontinued references, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks a lot !",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my experience after testing several 24‚Äù gaming monitors over the past few weeks. Hopefully this helps anyone trying to decide between these models. All of them were intended for 1080p gaming setups.\n\n**1. PHILIPS Evnia 24M2N3201A/00, 180Hz (1 white model and 3 black ones)**\n\nAll 4 units were returned for the same reason: severe backlight bleeding, especially in the top-left corner where two bright spots were very noticeable.\nOther than that, colors were excellent, the built-in speakers were decent, and 180Hz performed smoothly. If not for the aggressive bleeding, this would‚Äôve been my top choice.\n\n**2. ASUS TUF VG249Q1R, 23.8‚Äù, 165Hz**\n\nDidn‚Äôt get to test this one extensively, but it showed similar backlight bleeding to the Philips. Otherwise, performance and build felt comparable, nothing major to complain about, but nothing outstanding either.\n \n**3. Lenovo Legion R25f-30, 24.5‚Äù, 280Hz (actually 240Hz, but u can OC it to 280)**\n\nUsed this one for about a week. It had the least noticeable bleeding of all, just a thin, faint line on the left edge of the screen. However, color calibration was too damn tricky. It took a while to get a semi-decent look.\nWhat worked best for me was enabling 10-bit color in the NVIDIA Control Panel (with nvidia color settings as well) and/or switching to DisplayPort 1.2 (which only gives u 8bpc) instead of the default 1.4 mode. \nOnce tuned, it looked usable and performed great for high-refresh gaming. The 240hz were awesome. But I returned it because my eyes were hurting because of the colors. \n\n**4. TCL 25G64, 24.5‚Äù, QD-Mini LED, 300Hz**\n\nCurrently using this one. It also shows noticeable backlight bleed, similar to the Philips, but local dimming helps a lot. It‚Äôll only show a tiny bit in a corner after using the LM settings. But there‚Äôs a trade-off: with local dimming ON, brightness adjusts dynamically when switching windows and this can be annoying for some, I don‚Äôt really like it and if you turn it OFF, the bleeding returns.\n\nBut other than that, it‚Äôs really, really bright (my brightness is set to 40), colors are vivid, and it feels the most ‚Äúpremium‚Äù overall.\n\nThe overall **conclusion** is that if you‚Äôre sensitive to backlight bleeding, none of these are perfect.\nThey all have ups and downs. \n\nJust wanted to share this in case someone‚Äôs stuck choosing between these models, I hope it saves you some time (and returns üòÖ).\n\nGood luck and happy gaming! \n",

This is the first time I'm buying a monitor with some research behind it, so I'd appreciate some opinions.\n\n  \nMy use case is:\n\n* No gaming at all\n* Work/productivity focused. I read text... a lot.\n* I enjoy movies\n* No HDR.\n\nI had hoped that given my use case I could find a bargain with low refresh rate, No HDR requirement(my beat up ol' thinkpad has only hdmi 1.4), no need for fast response, but I've found such candidates are from local small-time oem brands with suspicious reputations. \n\nI searched around a lot on if I want VA or IPS, but after some intensive reading that what I found was that VAs have such a varying quality being a VA (or not) in itself doesn't seem to be the deciding factor.\n\nSome of the candidates I looked at:\n\n* Samsung S27F610\n* LG 27U631A\n* Samsung Odyssey G5 S27CG550\n* Samsung Odyssey G5 C32G54T - for some reason, this is selling at the same price as the one above, despite being 32 incher.\n* LG 27GS60QC\n\nThese are all under USD 200. If all else equal, I narrowed it down to either LG or Samsung, because around here those are the only brands I can be assured I'll have no issue using A/S. I know this sub's frequent recommendations are AOC Q27G3XMN miniLED or among LG's, 27GS85Q, or Samsung's higher Odyssey lineups, but those are really out of my budget. I understand these are not the most popular models in this sub but if any of you have experience to share I'd be very grateful.\n\n",

    "selftext": "We‚Äôve started a **partnership with Titan Army** and will be showcasing new models going forward (with honest community feedback) and probably some giveaways in the future. First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ‚Üî 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2√ó HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters. [P2712V Link](https://bit.ly/4gmDFse)\n\n**P275MV Plus (Mini-LED with DyDs)**\n\n* Same **4K/160 ‚Üî 1080p/320** dual mode\n* **Mini-LED FALD (1152 zones), HDR1000**\n* **What is DyDs**: the backlight is driven in sync with the panel update to keep motion clean **with local dimming on** and to improve visibility in dark scenes (less smearing/black crush than typical FALD IPS). [P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe‚Äôre currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

    "selftext": "Hi. I currently have an Alienware 32\" AW3225QF 4K 240Hz (right) and recently bought an ASUS 32\" XG32UCDM 4K 165Hz to use as my second monitor.\n\nMy question: should I return the ASUS on the left and replace it with my old Gigabyte M32U 4K 144Hz IPS monitor or keep it and sell the M32U? I'm looking for versatile use with gaming and productivity. I heard text clarity isn't as good on the OLED monitors, but to be honest I've been working on the Alienware for about a year now and notice no issues. Here are my use cases below:\n\n1. Gaming on one monitor\n\n2. Working on both monitors for my job. This would entail coding on the right monitor and probably more coding or documentation open on the left monitor. Sometimes there could be static pages left on screen. I don't see any benefit of an OLED in this case.\n\n3. Side projects on my PC or game development (Unity/Unreal Engine). The only use case I see for an OLED is if I was using Photoshop or Blender on the second monitor for anything while having UE open on the other, but would an OLED make a difference or be worth it in this case? \n\nThank you in advance for the answers.\n",

Also, i am a serious MMO veteran so perhaps I will try an MMO every now and then, but time is not there to invest.\n\nSo, my research led me to a preference on OLED with Glossy panels since color accuracy is important to me, peak brightness is not a terrible issue. But I am not an expert!\n\n My budget is capped around 700‚Ç¨-750‚Ç¨ and now after some research I rly like the following monitors:\n\n1.\t**Dell AW2725DF QD-OLED HDR Gaming** (This is my 1st choice I rly like the brand and it has a glossy panel that has high review scores especially on picture accuracy + 360 hz)\n\n2.\t**Asus ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG OLED HDR** ( It is a good package since price is good 590‚Ç¨ in Greece but I do not trust ASUS support and I ve seen some bad reviews for the monitor)\n\n3.\t**LG Ultragear 27GS95QE-B OLED HDR Gaming Monitor 27\"** ( I trust the brand support, but it seems to me that it is mostly placed as console OLED panel and lacks the quality of the Alienware)\n\nI also seen the Samsung G6 but I rly hate the silver colour and overall esthetics but.\n\nAs I said before I am not an expert since I come from a 10-year IPS 60hz panel and my choices consist of 2-3 days of reading reviews and watching videos.\n\nSo, I am turning to you. Could you please provide me with the best option for an OLED display for my build? And if possible, elaborate on that?\n\nThank you in advance !\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "AOC Q27G40XMN Dilemma",
    "selftext": "Hey all, grabbed a Q27G40XMN today on sale at Best Buy. It's got a manufactured date of 5/25. I got it set up and I've spent the last hour and a half or so trying to discern if it has the firmware bugs and if so how severe they are.\n\nI *think* it does have the bug, or at least a form of it. As described, when I've enabled displayhdr + strong local dimming at some point and then switched back to SDR + strong local dimming, I can see that the color of the AOC logo on the OSD has slightly shifted hues from orange, to a slight yellow-orange/orange-yellow. The difference is subtle, but noticeable if you are looking for it. \n\nWhat I will say is that I'm curious if this is potentially even a partially fixed firmware version where this bug is much less pronounced. The difference between the bugged state of SDR + strong local dimming and the normal state right after a monitor reset is so subtle that, as far as I've seen, I can literally only notice it on the OSD. I don't know if it's just that I've never had an HDR monitor before, but to me I'm having trouble seeing an issue even though the OSD looks like it's bugged. DisplayHDR looks excellent to me, SDR looks excellent to me, even the bugged state of SDR + strong local dimming looks excellent to me. \n\nMy questions would be this:\n\n1. Is the firmware bug believed to significantly impact the performance DisplayHDR + strong local dimming mode? If so, should it be bad enough that I can notice it with an untrained eye?\n\n2. Does anyone have ideas on ways to test more objectively to see if whatever version of this monitor firmware I have is performing acceptably in actual content and not just on the OSD? The only idea I have so far is to compare some test videos and colors to my only other HDR device, my iPhone, to see if there are any colors that are noticeably washed out on my monitor.\n\nLuckily it's Best Buy, so I should be in a position to easily return the monitor if I end up wanting to. The tough part is, I haven't been able to visibly see any issues outside of the OSD. If I hadn't read up on this issue in detail, I'm not sure that I ever would have noticed it. It's tough to jump straight to boxing it back up and returning it when the only way I can tell there's something wrong is looking at the OSD in the \"bugged\" state. \n\nI'm going to spend a day or so gaming with it and trying to find HDR content to really push a wide range of super bright content through it. Maybe I will come across something that makes it quite clear that there's an issue, and I'll update this if I do. With it being on sale and looking unbelievably good for $250, I think I could live with this version of the issue if the HDR performance doesn't disappoint, so I guess I'll try as much HDR content consumption as I can and see how I feel.\n\nAnyone else had a similar experience?",

I'm looking at... \n\n* ASUS ROG Swift PG32UQX\n* BenQ MOBIUZ EX321UX 32‚Äù\n* Acer Predator XB323QK 31.5\"\n\n...but it seems like LITERALLY EVERYTHING has a trade-off. Are there any obvious choices here? I've been saving for 2 years and have a huge pile of cash, so price is not really a concern.",

    "selftext": "This is an example of how mini led in blackout mode is able to eat up details in very dark scenes. Black spot on crosshair is fully black. Please note that increasing the shadow lightening by only 2 points will bring back the detail.\n\nMy monitor has two dynamic backlight modes. The images in the photo do not reflect how  see the image on the monitor. These are hypertrophied photos taken at 800 ISO and at 50% and 1600 ISO at 100% brightness (to even out the brightness level in the photo, at least a little bit). The shutter speed in all photos is 0.8 seconds. Ignore the blurriness due to the tremor.\n\nDimming mode do not produce visible blooming or other artifacts, but could hide some details in near pitch-black scenes. Blooming mode trying focus to brightening every even smallest bright details, which increases brightness overall and don't touch black details. But it produces visible blooming around objects accompanied by inverted blooming.\n\nConclusion: Mini-LED mediocre of keeping details in dark scenes, working in high dimming mode. I can assure you that the details are preserved in the Medium dimming mode, slightly reducing the contrast (it's perfect for low brightness).\n\nThis is not a hate post. Mini-LED backlight monitors has a right to exist and these are literally some of the best monitors that are quite capable of competing with OLED and even surpassing them in other scenarios.",

I currently have an Alienware 32\" AW3225QF 4K 240Hz (right) and recently bought an ASUS 32\" XG32UCDM 4K 165Hz to use as my second monitor.\n\nMy question: should I return the ASUS on the left and replace it with my old Gigabyte M32U 4K 144Hz IPS monitor or keep it and sell the M32U? I'm looking for versatile use with gaming and productivity. I heard text clarity isn't as good on the OLED monitors, but to be honest I've been working on the Alienware for about a year now and notice no issues. Here are my use cases below:\n\n1. Gaming on one monitor\n\n2. Working on both monitors for my job. This would entail coding on the right monitor and probably more coding or documentation open on the left monitor. Sometimes there could be static pages left on screen. I don't see any benefit of an OLED in this case.\n\n3. Side projects on my PC or game development (Unity/Unreal Engine). The only use case I see for an OLED is if I was using Photoshop or Blender on the second monitor for anything while having UE open on the other, but would an OLED make a difference or be worth it in this case? \n\nThank you in advance for the answers.\n",

    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI am currently building my new pc after 10 years and a glorious 980 GPU that finally died (RIP) with the following parts:\n\n**CASE:**\tBe Quiet Pure Base 500DX Gaming \r\n\n**M/B:**\tMSI MAG X870 TOMAHAWK WIFI Motherboard ATX\r\n\n**SSD:**\tSamsung 990 PRO SSD 2TB M.2 \r\n\n**RAM:**\tG.Skill Flare X5 DDR5 32GB RAM ŒºŒµ 2x16GB Modules\r\n\n**CPU:**\tAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.2GHz \r\n\n**GPU:**\tZotac GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 AMP Extreme INFINITY \r\n\n**PSU:**\tSeasonic Focus GX ATX3.1 2024 1000W \r\n\n**COOLING:**\tArctic Freezer III Pro 240 \r\n\nSince it is a very good build that will set me back around ‚Ç¨2.000 ,I decided not to cheap out on the monitor and go for a 1440p OLED, since I have an LG Cx TV that I enjoy.\n\nMy main usage is ofc gaming, my room is not especially bright plus most of my gaming session will occur after dark.\n\nMy gaming consists of AAA single player titles mostly these days, but I also want to experience some competitive multiplayer on games like (overwatch, CS2, ‚Ä¶etc) on which kids will destroy me! Also, i am a serious MMO veteran so perhaps I will try an MMO every now and then, but time is not there to invest.\n\nSo, my research led me to a preference on OLED with Glossy panels since color accuracy is important to me, peak brightness is not a terrible issue. But I am not an expert!\n\n My budget is capped around 700‚Ç¨-750‚Ç¨ and now after some research I rly like the following monitors:\n\n1.\t**Dell AW2725DF QD-OLED HDR Gaming** (This is my 1st choice I rly like the brand and it has a glossy panel that has high review scores especially on picture accuracy + 360 hz)\n\n2.\t**Asus ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG OLED HDR** ( It is a good package since price is good 590‚Ç¨ in Greece but I do not trust ASUS support and I ve seen some bad reviews for the monitor)\n\n3.\t**LG Ultragear 27GS95QE-B OLED HDR Gaming Monitor 27\"** ( I trust the brand support, but it seems to me that it is mostly placed as console OLED panel and lacks the quality of the Alienware)\n\nI also seen the Samsung G6 but I rly hate the silver colour and overall esthetics but.\n\nAs I said before I am not an expert since I come from a 10-year IPS 60hz panel and my choices consist of 2-3 days of reading reviews and watching videos.\n\nSo, I am turning to you. Could you please provide me with the best option for an OLED display for my build? And if possible, elaborate on that?\n\nThank you in advance !\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "AOC Q27G40XMN Dilemma",
    "selftext": "Hey all, grabbed a Q27G40XMN today on sale at Best Buy. It's got a manufactured date of 5/25. I got it set up and I've spent the last hour and a half or so trying to discern if it has the firmware bugs and if so how severe they are.\n\nI *think* it does have the bug, or at least a form of it. As described, when I've enabled displayhdr + strong local dimming at some point and then switched back to SDR + strong local dimming, I can see that the color of the AOC logo on the OSD has slightly shifted hues from orange, to a slight yellow-orange/orange-yellow. The difference is subtle, but noticeable if you are looking for it. \n\nWhat I will say is that I'm curious if this is potentially even a partially fixed firmware version where this bug is much less pronounced. The difference between the bugged state of SDR + strong local dimming and the normal state right after a monitor reset is so subtle that, as far as I've seen, I can literally only notice it on the OSD. I don't know if it's just that I've never had an HDR monitor before, but to me I'm having trouble seeing an issue even though the OSD looks like it's bugged. DisplayHDR looks excellent to me, SDR looks excellent to me, even the bugged state of SDR + strong local dimming looks excellent to me. \n\nMy questions would be this:\n\n1. Is the firmware bug believed to significantly impact the performance DisplayHDR + strong local dimming mode? If so, should it be bad enough that I can notice it with an untrained eye?\n\n2. Does anyone have ideas on ways to test more objectively to see if whatever version of this monitor firmware I have is performing acceptably in actual content and not just on the OSD? The only idea I have so far is to compare some test videos and colors to my only other HDR device, my iPhone, to see if there are any colors that are noticeably washed out on my monitor.\n\nLuckily it's Best Buy, so I should be in a position to easily return the monitor if I end up wanting to. The tough part is, I haven't been able to visibly see any issues outside of the OSD. If I hadn't read up on this issue in detail, I'm not sure that I ever would have noticed it. It's tough to jump straight to boxing it back up and returning it when the only way I can tell there's something wrong is looking at the OSD in the \"bugged\" state. \n\nI'm going to spend a day or so gaming with it and trying to find HDR content to really push a wide range of super bright content through it. Maybe I will come across something that makes it quite clear that there's an issue, and I'll update this if I do. With it being on sale and looking unbelievably good for $250, I think I could live with this version of the issue if the HDR performance doesn't disappoint, so I guess I'll try as much HDR content consumption as I can and see how I feel.\n\nAnyone else had a similar experience?",

And for this price i except a premium consistent experience, NOT this!\n\nAnd secondly, also only the left side earpad makes a mild squeaky toy noise when pressed, but right earpad is dead SILENT even when it's pressed. Is this is how it is suppose to be? Also ironically when earpads were interchanged, SURPRISE surprise! STILL only left side earpads makes this mild squeaky noise when pressed and whilst trying to wear it! (Despite the same earpad when on the right driver is dead SILENT and left earpads is silent on right?!)\n\nAnd thirdly!, the return policy is NON-EXISTENT! In my country!  And when asked about it throught their painfully call with executive they said RESET IT which I had already done MULTIPLE TIMES and tried MULTIPLE DEVICES from latest Android, IPAD AND MacBook Pro. Still it's persistent (random and occasional mild white noise/ mechanical noise from left ear driver alone)\n\nThey gave me an ultimatum to even get it checked I HAVE TO Ship my brand new expensive headphone AT MY OWN EXPENSE AND OWN RISK To their warehouse ACROSS THE COUNTRY! And after sonova took over all the service center were closed except one with courier-in type service center!\n\nMany told that the white noise/ TINNITUS issue SPECIFICALLY Left driver one is kinda common. Can you guys as confirm this for me and also other FUTURE BUYERS. Can you check and test in SILENT room with pausing after playing music.\n\nLastly, is this the QUALITY CONTROL by a 'TRUSTED' german brand?

    "selftext": "sounds a little unconventional but i tried it by accident once and i loved it.\n\nMy speakers and headphone amps are connected to the same dac, there was once i put my Grados on and played some music and i was wondering why they sound so dam good today. the sound stage was huge and somehow i could feel the bass! Till i took my headphones out and realised there was still music coming from my speakers ha!\n\nSo I tried with just the headphones and the sub and it filled the bass pretty well, its like getting the details from the headphones and yet being able to feel the bass in the room. Now i occasionally do it once in a while and it works really well with open backs that lacks a bit of bass!\n\nOf cos you do not want to try it with your IEMS\n\n",

    "selftext": "I had a go at processing the HUTUBS data, which are in ear measurements of the HRTFs and HD 800 S for 96 subjects, and the HD 650 for 64 subjects.\n\nMy intent was to compare the accuracy of the gras and bk5128 rigs to real heads. Each measurement is compensated to the diffuse field curve of the respective head with a -1 dB slope. By compensating to that target we are in effect \"subtracting\" the effect of each individuals ear geometry and are left with only the perceived variation in frequency response between heads caused by the acoustic impedance of the headphone.\n\nHD 800 S:\n\nBoth measurement rigs rise up to 4kHz too quickly and also show the first peak occurring closer to 6k, while real heads show it occuring around 5k. Using a tone generator I can hear it peaking at 5.2khz on my head. The second peak occurs around 7k in HUTUBS. On my head I can hear it around 7.2kHz. Both rigs show it closer to 8 kHz.\n\nUsing this as a basis for EQ results in a much more pleasing sound than the harman target profiles which don't deal with these peaks adequality.\n\nHD 650:\n\nThe HD 650 shows a lot more variance, despite that, there are features in the response that aren't present on either GRAS or BK rig. The first being a peak at 5kHz. Using a tone generator I can hear this very clearly on my head. Then there is a strong recession between 6k and 8k Hz which the gras rig doesn't show clearly.\n\nUsing this as a basis to EQ results in these two headphones sounding the most similar I've ever heard two different models of headphone sound (albeit still different).\n\nI've included headphones.coms processing of the same data for 30 heads, and the results seem similar.\n\nMy take away from this is despite the variance of the results between heads there is a clear average or trend in terms of the most common locations for peaks and dips, and neither of the most common industry standard rigs match it.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe HUTUBS, GRAS and BK5128 measurements all use different units. HD 800 S unit variation is incredibly good so hopefully this isn't an issue. I sourced the GRAS measurements from crinacle and the BK5128 measurements from earphones archive, and overlayed them on top of crinacles measurement.",

    "title": "Avantone Pro Planar the II - Impressive underdog?",
    "selftext": "First of all I want to emphasize - I'm by no means a audio aficionado, just ur regular hifi enjoyer I would say.  \nStarted my journey in my teens with some cheap ass amp + bookshelf setup which at the time was still way better than anything you could get from the electronic store next door.   \nAnyway back to the topic - HEADPHONES. Been using a lot of \"High-End\" Consumer Devices on the go, Sennheiser, Sony, Bose, \\*cough\\* Apple \\*cough\\* - Jokes aside, and for the past years i've been rocking my AKG K712 Pro at home being driven by my Onboard DAC/Amp on my PC.   \nThe AKG were already a WOW moment for me compared to those big brand Consumer devices at the time and to this day I love those cans. Still going strong after 10 years.   \nSound - Clear, Punchy and no headache even after hours listening at extensive volume. And the Soundstage? Phenomenal. \n\nHaving said that, I hope you got the reference to what I will be comparing the Avantone to.\n\nQuick mention - I do drive my Headphones with the Fiio K11 R2R since a couple weeks, which already improved the sound of the AKG by a mile compared to the onboard solution.\n\n\\- Avantone Planar 2 Impression starts here -\n\nOut of the box first impressions were not too overwhelming, they are fairly unimpressive at first glance from a visual standpoint, the boxy \"cheese grater\" design looks actually kinda nice in the polished black colour I got here tho.  \nBuild quality is very solid, compared to all my previous headphones which were all just big chunks of plastic you get a solid metal frame, fairly thick leather strap which also has the width to spread the enormous weight of the headphones across your head so they actually do NOT feel heavy at all.  \nThe AKG already had comfortable Velour Pads but damn, those Pads on the Avantone are silky smooth and nice to touch.\n\nNow to the sound,\n\nOut-of-the-box: Not to impressive if you ask me. I felt like something was \"missing\" compared to the AKG. Everything felt kinda flat and very narrow in comparison.  \nBy no means did they sound bad, but just.. boring?  \nHaving said that, the low-end did have more punch and they also provided more details in busy passages. It was just uninspired and so narrow, as if you were stuck in a small box.  \nAt that point I was contemplating if the price tag of 429‚Ç¨ was worth it or if I should return them.   \n  \nBut then I gave em another shot after researching a bit and applied an EQ (Self Tweaked Version of the u/Oratory1990 EQ for the first iteration of the Avantone Planar) via APO (Peace Interface) and I was simply shocked.  \nIt really opened up the stage and completely removed the feeling of being boxed in. They take the EQ as if they were made for it.   \n  \nThe low end got even more punch without any signs of being too much for the driver. The midrange is just as detailed as before but the elevated treble is what enhances the whole experience to new heights. As I described earlier everything sounds alive, the stage is wider and most importantly - It's fun! (Which I feel like is a point a lot of people forget to talk about)  \n\n\nBy no means do I have the equipment to measure those things or the extensive knowledge to compare it to hundred other headphones in different price brackets.   \nI cant tell you, especially after applying the EQ, if they follow some imaginary \"perfect\" frequency response curve.  \nAll I can say is - I love those things after applying the EQ and will keep them for a long time to come! \n\nThat is all from me, if there is anything you would like me to add feel free to ask in the comments as this is my first \"review\" I probably missed a ton of important stuff.\n\nCheers y'all!",

    "selftext": "I ordered the AC45 from Aune's Official Store (mall.auneaudio.com) as I wasn't sure how long it would be before they're more widely available in the US and whether they would be carried by any of their distributors since they're a fairly niche product category. Shipping to the US was free which is nice but at no point was there any mention that they wouldn't handle import fees (tariffs) on their end before the product was shipped and I didn't think anything of it since I've had multiple orders from China where the seller handled everything ahead of time which is the proper way to do it. Today I got an email from UPS that I need to pay for the import fees on a shipment and I knew right away what it was for, ended up paying $27 of which $15 went to UPS for their BS charges to handle the import paperwork and processing. I'm a little annoyed at Aune since not only do they not mention this on their website or at checkout but they also picked the worst possible shipping option since DHL, FedEx, and UPS are known to be POS companies that charge extra fees on top of the actual import fee for essentially doing nothing. If they had shipped it via the postal service it wouldn't have been as big of an issue since they won't charge that extra fee and I would've only had to pay $12 in stead of $27. So if you're in the US and are thinking about ordering from Aune directly be prepared to pay extra on top of what the item costs, it's worth getting their products through other sellers if you can even if the price is slightly higher than their own store is selling them for to avoid these extra charges and the added hassle.\n\nP.S. I know that Aune isn't entirely to blame since this wouldn't be an issue at all if it wasn't for the current joke of an administration pretending to run this country but it's also the current reality that we're forced to live with and other companies have handled it much better than Aune has. If they had taken the time to figure out what the best option was instead of basically ignoring it and making their customers deal with the aftermath this wouldn't be an issue.",

    "selftext": "So you decide to upgrade your audio setup with a nice pair of headphones. BuT WhAt PaIr Of HeAdPhOnEs? You ask. Well here it is a guide to headphone tuning.\n\nSo first off there needs to be a disclaimer being no matter what headphones you buy, they will not sound perfect to you. Sonic \"perfection\" is entirely unique to you with complex ideas like HRTF and more importantly how that noggin of yours processes sounds. To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

    "selftext": "Hello, I haven‚Äôt really seen much coverage of this product online, and I thought it deserves some more attention so I will try to share my thoughts.\n\nThis headphone is not available in many countries, but I was able to buy it from Aliexpress for around ¬£20($26) including postage. A retro-style lightweight Bluetooth openback headphones from Philips to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\n\nIn this product category, the closest competitor I could think of is Koss porta pro, Kph30i or the wireless koss porta pro all of which cost more than this product. I‚Äôve also compared it to some grados and my HD6XX and HD560s.\n\nGiven the price range, I was shocked at the tonal balance and the resolution. I would say Grado and Koss both have a very distinct texture of sound that makes it sound really cheap with little bass. In my ears, Ringo definitely has a more balanced V shape sound signature and has less of that cheap texture to the sound. Given my experience and preference, I would take this over Grado SR60/80i/e or Koss porta pro/kph30 any day for its timbre and tuning even if it was the same price point.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, the resolution or timbre isn‚Äôt gonna beat an HD6XX, and the build is quite cheap. But I find the build with its metal headband more sturdy than any of the Koss headphones that can even be triple the price. For a fun sounding Bluetooth headphones with 26 hour battery, lightweight and decent retro design AND built in app eq for around ¬£20 is crazy. \n\nI‚Äôve got too many headphones and have bought all the headphones mentioned in this review, but I will be keeping these around which is the biggest compliment I can give as I have given away/sold the all the Koss products. I‚Äôm no expert and have no intention to try over selling these but for anyone who‚Äôs considering a sub 100 open back Bluetooth headphones, these are the best in my experience!",

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. \n\nAfter many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to expand the rapidly growing collection and snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they‚Äôd be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. \n\nAfter about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. All the things the 600 family can‚Äôt do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. I would even say that I feel let down by the vocal presentation of the HD490 Pro's either, so I think it may just be some rose tinted glasses effect as I haven't owned my 6XX in nearly 4 years. Anyway, I started by just listening to the suede pads for the first 3-4 hours, and have now been listening to the other set. Both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. \n\nThe suede pads are definitely warmer and more relaxed, however after listening to both and EQ'ing with both, I find myself preferring the others. I don't know which are the mixing and which is the mastering set. The reason I am finding myself prefering these pads, I think, is because of the perceived extra detail from the mids and highs along with a more airy and open sense or a stage. I do understand why Sennheiser didn't have these in the 600 family, but I understand why so many have compared them, and I think there are some similarities.\n\nThe drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family (at least visually from the outside) but they provide a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the largest soundstage I‚Äôve heard from a Sennheiser, it‚Äôs not even close. In my opinion they pull this off with a sound signature that is easy to listen to but honest and competent, and definitely a Sennheiser open back. That all being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. \n\nAs someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. \n\nWeirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop‚Ä¶ I know what you want me to say, but I don‚Äôt hate them. They‚Äôre definitely not the headphone I‚Äôm going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I‚Äôm hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes.\n\nI absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is not floating my boat. I will be buying a new balanced cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro‚Äôs are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you‚Äôve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I‚Äôd love to hear other‚Äôs perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I‚Äôll get.",

    "selftext": "It‚Äôs been about a year since I bought the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones, and honestly‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm done with Bose. The multipoint connection is just terrible.\n\nSometimes when I connect another device, the first one just disconnects for no reason. If I‚Äôm on a call and another device connects, it drops the call or randomly switches the audio back to my phone‚Äôs speakers ‚Äî and then I can‚Äôt even get the sound back to Bluetooth unless I disconnect and reconnect the headphones.\n\nThe ear detection is also super inconsistent. Sometimes it pauses when I take them off, sometimes it keeps playing even when they‚Äôre around my neck. And other times, if I just tilt my head slightly, it pauses for no reason.\n\nBut the absolute worst part? Phone calls. Everyone I talk to keeps saying that they can hear all the background noise around me ‚Äî sometimes even louder than my own voice. I honestly don‚Äôt understand how a company that‚Äôs supposed to be the world leader in noise cancellation can‚Äôt make headphones that handle calls properly.\n\nAnd to top it off, there‚Äôs this constant beep I get every 10 seconds when the connection to a device is lost. You can‚Äôt disable it, and it‚Äôs infuriating. It basically forces me to turn off multipoint altogether ‚Äî which defeats the whole point of buying ‚Äúpremium‚Äù headphones that are supposed to handle multiple devices smoothly.\n\nI really wanted to love these, but between the connection issues, the unreliable ear detection, and the unusable mic for calls, I just can‚Äôt justify Bose anymore.",

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

No balanced, no DSP, just a power putton, volume dial and headphone ports. I love it. This might sound silly, but I really enjoy having dedicated 3.5mm and 1/4inch ports so I never have to use an annoying adapter anymore.\n\nI rarely see products of this company anywhere online, so I wanted to share it with you all (although you might know them by their high-end brand \"Violectric\"). This costs 240‚Ç¨, is built like a tank and - something I also rarely see marketed about - is proud of the built-in headphone protection circuits.

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nAs the title suggests, DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. I do not mean that as a joke, these cans are audio garbage and I don't know why folks keep buying them. \nI'm making this review based on memory from a couple months ago since I basically got rid of them as soon as they came.\n\nBass: DISTORTED BLOATED DUMPSTER FIRE.\nOh boy the bass on these is absolutely horrid, I actually thought something was wrong with my pair until I looked at the distortion charts and yep it aligns with what I heard. \nSubbass: rolled off and flabby at the same time, no matter how I powered it. It was just very farty and anything close to normal volume made it sound extremely sad. I am not joking when I say this but an HD600 with a subbass shelf has cleaner bass. IT CANNOT DO SUBBASS EVEN STOCK.\n\nMids: actually not too bad, nothing to write home about. I honestly don't know what to say about it except for its mediocre and VERY IN YOUR FACE. Suicideboys was the only artist that sounded okay.\n\nHighs: OH BOY IT GETS WORSE, there is something real nasty goin on in the low-mid treble. This was something that could not be fixed with mods or whatever I did. Maybe it's a reflection or resonance from the driver cover? I tried everything in the book and I could not fix it.\nBut anyway, the treble wasn't fun. It was a hazy mess, any track sounded sharp and not detailed at the same time. I can accept being slightly piercing IF there is a good amount of detail output.\n\nThe baseline is that there are WAYYY better cans at the same price. I have also seen DMS recommending them and I can sort of understand why since his listening volume is extremely low (compared to mine) and doesn't run into the same distortion problems (I think).",

    "selftext": "I feel lied to! All over this sub, and other IEM subs have repeatedly said, \"If you can get it loud enough then you don't need an amp!\" LIES!\n\nI went to a headphone shop today, I brought my own dongle DAC/Amp. Tried a bunch of headphones. You know what? Yes I could get the demo units up to par listening volume. It was loud enough. Didn't even need to get to 80% volume for it to be loud. Huh, sounds decent.\n\nThen the guy said to try it with a dedicated desktop amp. I plugged it in, and lo' and behold, the audio is richer, soundstage is bigger, the headphones came ALIVE. Before, it was tinny and flat, but loud enough. Crazily, with the amp, the volume was actually set lower. Did I volume match? No, but I didn't need to because I could hear the difference before I got to the same volume. \n\nI always turn the volume down to zero before swapping anything. Before I even got halfway there to the same volume, I could already hear how much richer the sound was.\n\nFYI, it was a Samsung S22 Ultra -> Luxury & Precision W4 -> 4.4mm Out, this was the dongle DAC setup that actually sounds quite phenomenal for IEMs, but with headphones the W4 simply could not produce enough juice to *really drive* the headphones (HiFiMAN Edition XS). \n\nSo, do you need an amp if you are using headphones? The technical answer is no, but if you want to get the best out of it, then yes you do.",

Moved the previous Topping E50/L50 stack to my study. No need for any other DAC/amps until something breaks.\n\nThe Antares is for my Stax and the hopefully soon repaired Sennheiser HE-60. More affordable than an equally powerful amp from Stax, and nice to have something hand-made in Germany, but it could really be a bit smaller.\n\nI got the Little Dot MK2 on a whim last year and very occasionally use it with my HD800.

    "title": "CVJ Neko: CVJ Neko: bass that hits and voices that whisper.",
    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n‚Üí Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n‚Üí Punchy bass.  \n‚Üí Delicious female vocals.  \n‚Üí Soundstage above average.  \n‚Üí No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n‚Üí DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n‚Üí If you are a purist, stay away.  \n‚Üí Mids somewhat soft.  \n‚Üí Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30‚Ç¨/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a ‚Äúmore and better.‚Äù\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:**¬†present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:**¬†this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:**¬†here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:**¬†somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:**¬†maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:**¬†with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:**¬†substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:**¬†too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:**¬†I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:**¬†at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:**¬†placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:**¬†keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:**¬†could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:**¬†testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko‚Äôs character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos‚Äô voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:**¬†testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once‚Ä¶ I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:**¬†dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:**¬†not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:**¬†paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:**¬†I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it‚Äôs unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you have fun‚Äù vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

This makes me suspect that my iPhone 17 Pro might have a defect in its audio chip or a related component. When I played the same songs on my older iPhone 13 Pro using AAC, there was no distortion. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have a Lightning dongle, so I couldn‚Äôt test aptX on the older phone. And also I have dropout problem when using both dongle.Does anyone else with an iPhone 17 series notice these issues?\n\nMy personal experience with these three little friends:\n\nYou really can‚Äôt go wrong with either dongle.\n\nQCC Pro\n\nHas its own app with a much better UX design. The slim form factor fits perfectly on a phone or tablet. Looks more premium in person (the photos make it seem cheaper than it is). Comes with only one dongle ‚Äî I originally thought there were two (one for the phone and one for the headphones that communicate directly), which would‚Äôve justified the higher price over the BTD700. The packaging design is a bit misleading.\n\nBTD700\n\nWorks great for home or office use.Doesn‚Äôt have a mobile app, but there‚Äôs one for PC/Mac. Sadly, I couldn‚Äôt update the firmware no matter what system I used. But it works. One simple button does everything you need.\n\nIn terms of sound, they‚Äôre very similar. I can only tell the difference when comparing side by side ‚Äî the QCC Pro‚Äôs mids are slightly louder and more forward.\n\nIf you like the QCC Pro‚Äôs design but prefer the BTD700‚Äôs price, check out the QCC Standard (white) version. I believe only Bloom Audio carries it, and they‚Äôre an awesome retailer. Please remember, Only QCC PRO Has LDAC.\n\nAbout the PX8 S2\n\nThey‚Äôre extremely comfortable. My head circumference is about 21.5\", and I‚Äôm very sensitive ‚Äî even picky ‚Äî about anything pressing on my head (I can‚Äôt stand most beanies). But I can wear the PX8 S2 for long sessions with no problem. My old XM3s and AirPods Max felt like Jigsaw‚Äôs traps in comparison.\n\nThe leather is incredibly soft ‚Äî genuinely reminiscent of Herm√®s leather. If you or your HAPPY WIFE have Herm√®s bags, you‚Äôll know what I mean.\n\nAs for sound quality, the PX8 S2 really shines with large-scale or orchestral music. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not good for solo performances ‚Äî I love listening to Yo-Yo Ma with them. For pop music, it‚Äôs more about personal preference. The sound is very balanced ‚Äî I like it a lot, but as I like to say, I like drinking water‚Ä¶ and you might not.\n\n\\*I use gpt to make my post more readable and I also post this review on B&W subreddit. Any advice or question are welcome\n\n",

Personally, I‚Äôm not a believer in all that snake oil ‚Äî people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don‚Äôt buy it. And honestly, I don‚Äôt think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I‚Äôve always thought that if there‚Äôs any difference, it‚Äôs basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time ‚Äî I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a ‚Äúbigger soundstage,‚Äù I just assume it‚Äôs because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I‚Äôm open-minded ‚Äî I‚Äôll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that‚Äôs matched, everything else ‚Äî bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging ‚Äî sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I‚Äôm out. Either they‚Äôre trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don‚Äôt. In either case, their opinions don‚Äôt mean much to me anymore, because I can‚Äôt hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let‚Äôs talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn‚Äôt tell exactly what at first, but it didn‚Äôt feel like my imagination. After more testing ‚Äî switching headphones, replaying the same tracks ‚Äî I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head ‚Äî especially those higher notes ‚Äî in a way the K7 doesn‚Äôt. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that‚Äôs somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it‚Äôs like their voice locks into one spot ‚Äî more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this ‚Äî it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you ‚Äî same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat‚Äôs not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer‚Äôs right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste ‚Äî some benefit from that extra space, some don‚Äôt. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** ‚Äî *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn‚Äôt huge, but it‚Äôs there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It‚Äôs actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it‚Äôs slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less ‚Äúexciting.‚Äù The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah ‚Äî I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It‚Äôs pricey, and there‚Äôs no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat‚Äôs my honest take.",

    "selftext": "So I previously had upgraded from some generic brand headphones to the JBL Quantum One's. They blew me away - I hadn't been expecting an actual increase in audio quality, just that they'd be more comfortable to wear, but they were noticeably better on audio quality, by what seemed like a significant amount.\n\nMore recently (a few months ago) my first set got to the point that I decided it was time for a replacement set. That one had connectivity issues straight out of the box: every time I'd move or turn my head *even slightly*, the connection would quit and I'd have to unplug and re-plug them in again.\n\nEventually I got tired of this and bought a *third* set. Which also, immediately out of the box, gave me the same issue. I switched the wires I was using - since each set came with it's own - but the problem persisted.\n\nAt this point, I'm just beyond done fiddling with these obscene excuses of technology and want to find something I won't have to worry about replacing multiple times to get a functioning set from.",

    "title": "Advice for the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs 80ohm Headphones",
    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

This is usually resolved by installing the USB DAC driver provided by the maker, but [SMSL does not have such a driver for the R1](https://www.smsl-audio.com/portal/product/downlist/id/11.html).\n\nThe sound when the treble/bass sliders are set to flat and EQ is set to 1 (neutral) is decent, soundstage is wide and imaging is pleasing. I would say it sounds as good as any good dongle DAC out there. The volume dial stepping is digital, and its 0% volume rest position is around 8 o'clock but audio cannot be heard until the dial moves to just above 8 o'clock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unh2e5uyb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=543c5fadfb1cc44339cf3758d73cf601b3a33d75\n\nWhen all processing is flat/off there is no noticeable distortion even at high volume on both HE1000se and HD600. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih4wc1k5c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=729948d649f5ce4ddf421d1be1c21acebfcce333\n\nThe power output is 130mW so quite low, but it's capable of driving both headphones just fine and loud.\n\nWhen you enable any EQ or adjust the tone controls, distortion comes in at higher volumes especially noticed in songs with bass or audio with bass, so for gamers playing shooters, this is a big issue if you want to tone control or use one of the better EQ presets as flat is just that and lacks any smoothness/warmth in sound signature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j87meo97c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76683158a5dc1f033677e071151592f4e455520c\n\nUsing it is a DAC only and pre-amp using the RCA outputs to the power amp it does an OK job although there is noticeable noise floor interference that can be heard, just like what I found with the Creek 4040A a while back. Seems the analogue circuitry is not isolated.\n\nI then plugged in the RCA interconnect between the X9 and power amp to test and heard no noticeable interference noise. In this config the power amp was set to bypass and R1 used as pre-amp, in pure DAC mode and volume controlling via the power amp, the same noise can be heard once you increase the power amp's volume, the R1's volume is maxed out in this test to imitate bypass and be DAC only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r54td2q8c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3de0a8271051809a0c92c11c9a8c9092c9be0307\n\nIt is priced at $71 currently, I think if you must have a desktop sitting box to use and interact with then ok it's fine, but these caveats have to be considered. Otherwise I would say the ONIX Alpha XI1 offers better sound with none of the distortion issues or noise etc at a slightly higher price and offers more power, lower THD+N.\n\nThe other advantage of the R1 though is it has dedicated mic input, although if you are a gamer you almost certainly have a USB mic or headset anyway so this is not really a selling factor.\n\nThe volume dial is super slick though, there is that....\n\nI was unable to open up the housing properly for a teardown as even with all the screws out, I could not lift out the top panel with the sliders properly without fearing breaking something. Either it is glued on, or there is a method to it.",

    "selftext": "I work a desk job where I'm on the phone at least half the day. I got sick of the provided headset so I bought this set for work, being wireless, good battery life, good mic features (that noise fence tech is the real MVP). Usually I'll wear these over a set of flathead IEMs when I'm on the phone. These can do dual connection with BT and the usb dongle, just never really thought to use them for my phone. I forgot my IEMs going into the office the other day, so I set up the BT for music and HOT DAMN.\n  \nWith ANC on these are absolute bass cannons. The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these. If you're a fellow bass head and need something for a job with remote communication, 10/10 I suggest these.",

    "selftext": "Today I received the brand-new FiiO K13 R2R DAC/AMP, which I picked up mainly out of curiosity to explore the sound signature of R2R technology. My current setup includes the Topping DX5 II, which absolutely shines with electronic genres (rave, techno, acid, house, IDM, EDM) you name it.. It delivers dynamic, crystal-clear audio with a wide soundstage and stunning detail. Paired with the Arya Organic, it's a near-perfect match for me, of course, within this price range.\n\nHowever, when it comes to vocals, film scores, classic rock, or pop, the DX5 II can feel a bit too clinical,,almost overly precise. That‚Äôs exactly why I decided to try the K13, hoping for a warmer, more organic presentation thanks to the R2R DAC.\n\nA/B testing starts today, and I‚Äôll share a more detailed review over the weekend. If you‚Äôve got experience with the K13 or other R2R DACs, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!",

But this is my office, and although I do have a nice stereo system here, headphones are sometimes more adequate. I've recently got a pair of Sennheiser HD600s, powered by a Fiio K11 R2R, and they work fine.\n\n  \nPerhaps my questions are more on the subject of headphones than of this one in particular, maybe. I use Sonus Faber Sonettos here, and I absolutely love them. The headphones just seem \"constrained\" maybe. I am not good at describing such things. But they seem to be lacking \"openness\" and some space. Don't know if it's the HD600s, the amp, or just the nature of headphones themselves, being placed in your head for example, I know their weight may be a factor, I don't know, just not feeling it.\n\n  \nHope any of you can relate and give me some advice, thank you all!",

    "selftext": "I listened to both back-to-back, and both sounded amazing, but I definitely felt like the Ananda Nano was clearer and on every track, and you could definitely notice a difference. \n\nHowever, people kept saying the Edition XS bass is better than the Nano, but I felt the Nano's bass hit harder, and sometimes felt like it was overdone. \n\nFor example, I played Drakes ‚ÄúFrom Time‚Äù, and the bass sounded boomy, different to how my AirPods Pro 2, Edifier R2000DB and how the Edition XS presenter the bass - they all sounded correct.

Can this bass be EQ‚Äôd?\n\nThe XS sounded perfect, but the Ananda Nano sounded a bit boomy.

In this review, I‚Äôll be speaking about the Kiwi Ears Ardor, a pair of Wireless Over Ear headphones with ANC capabilities and sold for a competitive listing price.\n\n>*Disclaimer: the Kiwi Ears Aventus were sent to me by Kiwi Ears so that I could write an honest review. This review represents my personal opinion on the set, it isn't promotional or paid content and I don‚Äôt get any revenue from the sales of this product.*  \n*At the time of the review, the Kiwi Ears Aventus were on sale for about $72.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4giq7q011yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee4768ab389034deee24688b0c66af6a709d16cd\n\n# Technical Specifications\n\n* Type of headphone ‚Üí Over-Ear\n* Driver Configuration ‚Üí Dual DD 40mm + 10mm coaxial\n* Bluetooth version ‚Üí 5.4, supporting SBC and AAC codecs (no AptX, no LDAC) +¬† low-latency mode\n* Bluetooth range ‚Üí 8-10m (free open environment)\n* ANC ‚Üí Hybrid ANC, noise reduction depth -32B¬±3dB\n* Battery capacity and declared battery life ‚Üí 1000mAh, for a total of about 18hrs with ANC+RGB ON, 45hrs with ANC ON and 82hrs with ANC OFF\n* Fast charging ‚Üí Yes, 10 mins of charge correspond to 4 hours of playback (with ANC OFF)\n* Frequency response ‚Üí 20Hz-40KHz\n* Impedance ‚Üí 16‚Ñ¶ ¬± 10% @ 1KHz\n* Sensitivity ‚Üí 102dB ¬± 3dB @ 1KHz 1mW\n* Weight ‚Üí 290g (measured on my own non-professional scale)\n* Charging port ‚Üí Type-C\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus come well packed and the box contains:\n\n* The Kiwi Ears Aventus\n* A Detachable Audio cable\n* A USB Type-C charging cable\n* A USB Type-C charging data cable\n* One pair of tuning foam pads\n* A User Manual\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pai8tu1211yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32969399057b4033a0436c5ea40f887de653a619\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wvslc2211yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9efb4d8248c5ec6bca280f13fac1bff2531f3a08\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ronqcdr311yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c12208d2b329ec81ee43216ecbae80d793fd5442\n\n# Design, Build Quality, Comfort and Isolation\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus look very ‚ÄúDJ‚Äù-ish, with a pretty thick junction between the earcups and the sliders and a large headband. The earcups themselves have RGB lighting that you can activate or keep OFF, and when the RGB lights are OFF the headphones just look like any other headphone. When turned ON, they give some sort of gaming vibes which is confusing since these are supposed to be sold to DJs so it doesn‚Äôt seem like the target is well-defined, at least if we speak about lighting only.¬†\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knkv19g411yf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a782c04a5cdf3988d4358633ff85fbc2be306cb3\n\nThe overall build quality is solid, the sliders look and feel sturdy, the earcups themselves have about 90¬∞C swivel on the back and and a couple degrees of swivel on the front as well to grant some headroom for proper fit and the overall softness of the pads and headband cushion is decent. The headphones are also foldable and this makes up for an easy-to-carry set, even though they sit quite awkwardly in the storage case.  The comfort itself is pretty good from my own experience, just be aware that the pleather pads could become pretty warm during summer or hot periods in general.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omubezl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10a9cf8e2c43f1a1950eb07df223cd4aed1cf480\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0ozhzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfcc854db3fd68d9f35ff467f2d33782027dd5bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8rgrzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826ba7f50c9920c089b54a0447621625ffde6a38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5ckyyl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=609c2127c547e2efb3f8dfc959c2c34f4c1fa761\n\nThe buttons on the earcups are responsive and they don‚Äôt cheap when clicked since there‚Äôs enough tension to them, even though the sound coming from them could have been a bit more muted in order to feel more ‚Äúpremium‚Äù (but that‚Äôs just a nitpick, nothing else).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/poj54dc711yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89863a313cd6087121e7fb116333aab9eb5c1eb9\n\n# Battery Life and Connectivity\n\nThe battery life is pretty good yet not the best you can find in this price range (especially considering that the Ardor exist) good, and although I didn‚Äôt have the chance to test the full 45¬† hours with ANC ON and RGB lighting OFF, I have done some testing and noted the remaining battery life after some listening.\n\nAfter 30 hours of listening with no charge between multiple sessions, the battery life displayed on my phone‚Äôs bluetooth settings for the Aventus was 29%, meaning that 71% of the battery was consumed in the first 30 hours of listening. Hypothesizing the same usage, which involved slightly different volume levels, ANC ON and RGB OFF and random calls here and there, we can assume that about 10 more hours of listening will consume the remaining battery life (more or less).\n\nSure, these aren‚Äôt objective measurements in optimal conditions (mixed usage, various volume levels, a couple calls here and there) but these are respectable numbers from my point of view.\n\nSomething that I cannot understand is the reason why a DJ would use these with bluetooth, since although these are shipped with a couple wires to use them wired, they are still promoted as DJ headphones, hence it‚Äôs pretty confusing that you have RGB lighting and bluetooth (I can understand ANC, instead, since it could help isolating from external noises during live sets).\n\nSo, you can use these wired connecting them to your amp or DJ console/controller, or you can use them in bluetooth mode: in this regard,I haven‚Äôt experienced any issues, disconnections or other types of problems related to pairing and/or connecting to the headphones, both in single point and multi-point mode. Just make sure you pair every single device singularly before using them in multi-point mode and you‚Äôll be fine.\n\n# ANC/Transparency feature, Latency and Commands\n\nThe ANC of the Kiwi Ears Aventus is okay, and even though you‚Äôre not getting Bose-like ANC you‚Äôre still getting some isolation that will avoid super high volumes just to get rid of the surrounding noises. The passive isolation is pretty good as well so those in combination do the job, especially considering Just like with the Ardor, I have noticed a weird behaviour of the ANC when I‚Äôm on the bus and the bus itself meets some street bumps along the way: in those cases, the ANC makes some annoying pops that I have already heard when using my KZ Carol TWS. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but it‚Äôs something worth mentioning.\n\nThe transparency feature works well, it doesn‚Äôt emphasize things too much making them almost ‚Äúartificial‚Äù and I think it‚Äôs definitely usable. I have used sets with a better transparency mode, but I think this is on-point and accomplishes the task pretty well.\n\nThe latency is there, I am not gonna lie, and even using the low-latency mode it still isn‚Äôt low enough to make hassle-free gaming possible: if you‚Äôre playing games and want a wireless set, I don‚Äôt think this is the right one, it‚Äôs just better to buy a headset with proprietary 2.4GHz dongle since universal bluetooth connectivity has its own limits (and these don‚Äôt even have AptX to compensate for them).\n\nThe commands are responsive and easy to understand, and haven‚Äôt encountered any issue in this regard.\n\n# Sound\n\n**GEAR USED FOR THE TEST**\n\n* Mobile phones: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Xiaomi Mi A3, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n* Laptop and Desktop PC with Bluetooth 5.1 USB adapter\n* Lenovo Chromebook Duet\n\n**Let‚Äôs talk about the sound**\n\nI will be talking about the Aventus with ANC ON and Music Mode ON.\n\nThe Aventus are mostly balanced with some added bass, a relaxed upper midrange and slightly boosted treble response (not fatiguing though). Depending on your head-size and on how they fit and clamp on your head, you‚Äôre going to have slight deviations from what I am saying and that is probably one of the weaknesses of this product. The main issue, in fact, is that very small positioning differences on my head lead to sound differences that I struggle to explain, so it was a very inconsistent experience in my case and a very hard product to review.¬†\n\nTo me, the Aventus are okay, with an overall balanced response that never gets overdone in a specific part of the response. The bass, for example, is not overcooked or muffled, nor is it too thick/overpowering, and it‚Äôs there in the right quantity with average speed. It‚Äôs not very textured yet not super fat to the point that you don‚Äôt hear any texture in it, if that makes sense.  \nThe lower midrange has some added warmth even though the midbass isn‚Äôt rich enough to empower the lower mids, so the lower mids are probably boosted by the tuner to warm things up a bit without the need of pushing the bass more than that. The upper mids, instead, aren‚Äôt fatiguing and they never become hot, and I‚Äôd say that they‚Äôre not as emphasized as on your average Harman-tuned headphone.  \nThe treble isn‚Äôt fatiguing but there‚Äôs some spice here and there to avoid darkness, even though the highs definitely feel like something is missing up top (some details and sparkle, for example). The mid-treble can get a bit peaky at times also and this makes some cymbals slightly unnatural or splashy and some ‚ÄúS‚Äù sounds a bit sharp occasionally.  \nUsing the spare foams included in the box can attenuate the treble even more, although I don‚Äôt really find these annoying.  \n  \nThe soundstage isn‚Äôt very spacious, but it‚Äôs okay for a closed back set, and the imaging is also okay overall. Nothing to write home about I‚Äôd say but no true bad words to spend here either.¬†\n\nTurning OFF the ANC gives the sound a warmer tint, the mid-treble emphasis is tamed a bit and the headphones become a touch more controlled and relaxed, even though they are still mildly V-shaped. The soundstage and imaging remain intact.\n\nClicking the ANC button twice activates the gaming mode, which kinda makes the bass tighter and gives a more V-shaped tinge to the sound with slightly tighter and less thick bass and more treble emphasis. I‚Äôd say it helps a bit with spatial cues in game even though a pair of KSC75 or similar stuff will still give you cleaner positional cues, period.\n\n**Microphone quality**\n\nThe microphone quality is passable, nothing that screams high quality but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs usable for calls and similar stuff. The noise cancellation is overall pretty strong, which is good news, although sometimes it cuts out some parts of my voice trying to eliminate the surrounding noises.  \nHere you have an example of the microphone quality:\n\n# Some comparisons:¬†\n\n**Kiwi Ears Ardor vs Kiwi Ears Aventus**\n\n>With ANC ON, both are tendentially bassy and warm-sounding with average technical performance. However, the Aventus goes for a warmer presentation up top, with less upper midrange and less low-end as well. The main issue, in my opinion, is that the response relies too much on the positioning of the headphones on the head, leading to an inconsistent listening experience that I found dealbreaking. The technical performance of the Aventus is also inferior compared to the Ardor and varies with positioning on the head. The Ardor sound less loud even at higher volumes compared to the Aventus. In terms of overall value, the Ardor are a lot more specific, they look and feel like a more well-thought product and target the average casual user who wants a portable, comfortable and bassy headphone for the day-to-day commuting, whereas the Aventus are still confusing to me: they have RGB to appeal gamers, the DJ design to appeal DJs, but they somehow have a sort of ‚Äúinconsistent‚Äù sound experience which is not ideal for DJs since they never stay in the same position when they‚Äôre performing (source: I used to DJ as well so I know what I am talking about). In addition, the Ardor has better battery life so it‚Äôs the smarter choice between the two if you don‚Äôt wanna charge it as frequently as you‚Äôd do with the Aventus (not that their battery life is bad but the Ardor have better battery life and that‚Äôs objective).  \nIn my opinion, the Ardor gives you something more for your money and it‚Äôs a sleeker and more comfortable set for everyday use. The Aventus are not ‚Äúbad‚Äù per se, but some quirks make them less recommendable than the similarly priced Ardor, which are a lot more consistent no matter how you wear them and truly feel like something that was designed a touch better.\n\n**Kiwi Ears Aventus vs Sony WH-1000XM5**\n\n>Very different price yet maybe someone could be curious to compare a couple different options. To me, both sound a touch unnatural, but there are a couple key differences.   \nThe XM5 sound more V-shaped with brighter treble and a lot more low-end (even too much at times). However, they almost sound the same everytime I wear them whereas the Aventus are kinda inconsistent so the perceived level of bass and treble kinda depends on the fit. In terms of overall technical performance, I think there aren‚Äôt big differences even though the XM5 sound sometimes more resolving due to the brighter treble (it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúperceived‚Äù clarity‚Äù up top but it doesn‚Äôt really translate into a better opinion from my side).  \nThe comfort is good on both sets but the WH-1000XM5 sit on my head way better and are more stable. In terms of passive isolation and ANC, the WH-1000XM5 easily takes the lead.  \nIn terms of overall customization through the app, bluetooth codecs and so on, the WH-1000XM5 easily win. However, I‚Äôd say the battery life of the Aventus is one of their strengths (even though you have to count the worse ANC and so on).  \nThe price is very different and although the sound signatures are different, the sum-up of this comparison is that spending more will give you a more refined and well-though product.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus aren't revolutionary nor do they set new standards. It's a set that has some fit issues that lead to an inconsistent sound, so everyone's experience may vary depending on the size of the head, on how the headphones are placed on the head, and it's probably the biggest fault of this product.  \nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus score a 3/5 from me, which may seem like a bad vote but that is a 6/10 that hopefully will convert into a better rank if they'll ever release a sequel with better overall consistency. The sound is pretty pleasant, the comfort is nice, the headphones are foldable and they should appeal to many users, but the target market itself is also confusing so it's another thing that makes them less \"specific\".  \nSome say \"Don't bite off more than you can chew\", and this is probably the way I'd like to end my review: I think Kiwi Ears is able to appeal most of the people out there but they should not do that with a single product. It's much better to carefully design a product targeted to very specific users rather than trying to make one that has to appeal many people without excelling in anything particular for those specific users.  \n  \nThanks Kiwi Ears for starting the journey in over-ear headphones, this is a welcomed choice and hopefully we'll see even more competition in the full-size cans' market space.  \n",

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

    "selftext": "This topic has been discussed by others here and elsewhere before, but I genuinely couldn't find a conclusive answer, so I'm asking here: how much power do T50s actually need?\n\n\n\nPeople seem to often conflate \"loud enough\" with \"getting powered properly\". Loudness is dependant on gain, i.e. Voltage, but that's literally only half the equation for power. As far as I understand it, the issue is that you obviously need current as well to move the driver, but also that impedance is dependant on frequency (due to inductance and capacitance of the headphone). So certain headphones might be loud enough at lower power, but actually have a changed frequency response.\n\n  \nTheory aside, I actually noticed this myself with my Dekoni Blue (factory modded T50RP MK3s). They had a noticeably better bass response on my topping NX1s (150 mW into 32Œ©) compared to my SMSL M3 (108mW into 32Œ©), even though these are both overspeced, when going by Headphone.com's power calculator (suggesting 3.98mW for 110dB). Obviously everyone agrees that that number is completely off, judging, by the T50s reputation for being hard to drive, but nobody ever explains why exactly that's the case, or how much power they actually require. Logically there would have to be a point where the frequency response stops changing, and I'd like to know where that point is.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has a better explanation for the physics of power requirements please also share. I think this topic is surrounded by so many half-truths, it's impossible to find good information. ",

    "selftext": "***TL;DR:*** *Yes, they're that good. For me they hit all the sweet spots with ideal compromises for the price/package. The best ANC/Wireless/BT headphone I have heard. I think they deserve the hype in their neutral / out-of-the-box EQ. They cherry pick lots of great qualities and bundle them into a class defining package. I am happy they hit the price point they do. They feel made with love and care for anyone that loves high quality sound. They're what I have been looking for and they deliver.*\n\nStuff I use as references / comparisons / competition:\n\n* Sennheiser ie900 + Qudelix 5K PEQ \n* Focal Clear OG + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Elegia\n* sennheiser HD650 + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Bathys + Android/Linux\n* Sony WH-1000XM5 + Android/Linux\n\nMusic I usually listen to:\n\n*   Mostly metal/rock/prog (Bleed from Within, Knocked Loose, Mars Volta, Mastodon, QOTSA, Deftones...)\n*   Classic rock (think Fleetwood Mac, Beetles,  and friends)\n*   Pop/Alt (Taylor Swift, Wolf Alice, Last Dinner Party, Manchester Orchestra, Portugal. The Man, ...)\n*   Hip hop, mostly 90s but also some newer stuff\n*    Jazz, but only on a Friday\n\n**Sound**\n\nThe important bit. All thoughts are based on the neutral, default EQ settings.\n\nI have different headphones for different things. I have my Focal Clears and ie900 for detail. I have my HD650 for cosy and relaxed listening.\n\nI have my Focal Bathys for times when I need to block the world out and enjoy music without disruption.\n\nI have my WH-1000XM5 for ... everything else. Seriously, I wear these 8 hours a day while working, doing the dishes, hoovering, gardening.\n\nThey're just great at being portable and disappearing on my head. They get out of the way and the sound is very unremarkable and never distracting.\n\nOh and the Elegia. They're terrible. We don't talk about those.\n\nNow imagine if somehow all those headphones were put in a blender and out poured the perfect mix of them all. All the compromises in the right places. The bad bits barely noticeable. The good bits there in enough measure to make the whole mix perfect.\n\nThat's the HDB630.\n\n* Just enough detail that I can listen to the detail without being waterboarded and fatigued by it.\n* Just enough warm buttery smooth mid-range without being muddy or overly warm.\n* Just enough treble sparkle without feeling ringy, metallic, or sharp.\n* Just enough bass without feeling swollen, thick, or intrusive.\n* Just enough width and imaging without feeling sparse or overwhelming.\n* Just enough physical lightness and clamping to be comfortable.\n* Just enough flattery of the recording without being cute.\n* Just enough ANC without ... well, the ANC could be better but nobody is beating Sony.\n* Just enough for serious listening without hogging your attention\n\nPoint is, it's enough of everything. In the right mix. It is just ... right. My Bathys will be going on ebay or something, and I can't see my XM5 getting much use anymore.\n\nThey're not \"impressive for a closed back\" or \"impressive for a wireless headphone\" or anything like that. They're \"impressive. Full stop. In all categories.\".\n\n**BT700 dongle + App**\n\nThis all seems OK. Not really played with it too much and don't feel the need. The dongle works fine and works on Linux so that's good.\n\nBT on Android was the usual. Seems stable.\n\n**Build quality**\n\nIt's enough. If not having metal hinges means they hit the price point, then good on them. I'd rather this level of sound\n\nwas accessible to as many people as possible. The chassis is good. Comfort is good. Not the best, but perfectly enough.",

It's a tool to create personalized EQ settings for your headphone on your head, and it's focused on convenience and usability.\n\nWe have now created a how-to video that shows how we (the creators) use the tool. The approach shown in the video is only one of multiple possible ways and there's more information in the Q&A section.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo)\n\nNote: You will need an EQ app like EqualizerAPO / Peace or EqMac to comfortably listen to music and other things on your system -- the Owliophile tool is only there to help you find the right settings.\n\nWe're planning to make more videos on the technical / theoretical background, as well as explaining all details of the tool, so if you're curious you are welcome to subscribe to the channel. Anyway, I hope this first one serves as a good and practical introduction to the topic of personalized equalization for some of you.\n\nCheers!  \nOwlio",

    "title": "Audeze LCD 2C - One Month Review",
    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

Loved how clear and Fun everything sounded to me and thus learned more about sound in general. Then I got some Kz iems, liked it and switch over to the Letshouer S12, but then my m4's broke. So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

    "selftext": "I had a go at processing the HUTUBS data, which are in ear measurements of the HRTFs and HD 800 S for 96 subjects, and the HD 650 for 64 subjects.\n\nMy intent was to compare the accuracy of the gras and bk5128 rigs to real heads. Each measurement is compensated to the diffuse field curve of the respective head with a -1 dB slope. By compensating to that target we are in effect \"subtracting\" the effect of each individuals ear geometry and are left with only the perceived variation in frequency response between heads caused by the acoustic impedance of the headphone.\n\nHD 800 S:\n\nBoth measurement rigs rise up to 4kHz too quickly and also show the first peak occurring closer to 6k, while real heads show it occuring around 5k. Using a tone generator I can hear it peaking at 5.2khz on my head. The second peak occurs around 7k in HUTUBS. On my head I can hear it around 7.2kHz. Both rigs show it closer to 8 kHz.\n\nUsing this as a basis for EQ results in a much more pleasing sound than the harman target profiles which don't deal with these peaks adequality.\n\nHD 650:\n\nThe HD 650 shows a lot more variance, despite that, there are features in the response that aren't present on either GRAS or BK rig. The first being a peak at 5kHz. Using a tone generator I can hear this very clearly on my head. Then there is a strong recession between 6k and 8k Hz which the gras rig doesn't show clearly.\n\nUsing this as a basis to EQ results in these two headphones sounding the most similar I've ever heard two different models of headphone sound (albeit still different).\n\nI've included headphones.coms processing of the same data for 30 heads, and the results seem similar.\n\nMy take away from this is despite the variance of the results between heads there is a clear average or trend in terms of the most common locations for peaks and dips, and neither of the most common industry standard rigs match it.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe HUTUBS, GRAS and BK5128 measurements all use different units. HD 800 S unit variation is incredibly good so hopefully this isn't an issue. I sourced the GRAS measurements from crinacle and the BK5128 measurements from earphones archive, and overlayed them on top of crinacles measurement.",

This is erratic and random sometimes it doesn't! This tinnitus type noise goes away after a few seconds! And comes back when music is paused and it's a repeat cycle!(And no this isn't ANC noise coz it happens when even ANC IS OFF and only happens on the left ear driver/ hardware). And for this price i except a premium consistent experience, NOT this!\n\nAnd secondly, also only the left side earpad makes a mild squeaky toy noise when pressed, but right earpad is dead SILENT even when it's pressed. Is this is how it is suppose to be? Also ironically when earpads were interchanged, SURPRISE surprise! STILL only left side earpads makes this mild squeaky noise when pressed and whilst trying to wear it! (Despite the same earpad when on the right driver is dead SILENT and left earpads is silent on right?!)\n\nAnd thirdly!, the return policy is NON-EXISTENT! In my country!  And when asked about it throught their painfully call with executive they said RESET IT which I had already done MULTIPLE TIMES and tried MULTIPLE DEVICES from latest Android, IPAD AND MacBook Pro. Still it's persistent (random and occasional mild white noise/ mechanical noise from left ear driver alone)\n\nThey gave me an ultimatum to even get it checked I HAVE TO Ship my brand new expensive headphone AT MY OWN EXPENSE AND OWN RISK To their warehouse ACROSS THE COUNTRY! And after sonova took over all the service center were closed except one with courier-in type service center!\n\nMany told that the white noise/ TINNITUS issue SPECIFICALLY Left driver one is kinda common. Can you guys as confirm this for me and also other FUTURE BUYERS. Can you check and test in SILENT room with pausing after playing music.\n\nLastly, is this the QUALITY CONTROL by a 'TRUSTED' german brand? And hassle is almost unbearable and everytime I PAUSE I get left ear driver making a very mild tinnitus sound randomly! \n\nu/sennheiserconsumer\n",

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. \n\nAfter many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to expand the rapidly growing collection and snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they‚Äôd be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. \n\nAfter about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. All the things the 600 family can‚Äôt do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. I would even say that I feel let down by the vocal presentation of the HD490 Pro's either, so I think it may just be some rose tinted glasses effect as I haven't owned my 6XX in nearly 4 years. Anyway, I started by just listening to the suede pads for the first 3-4 hours, and have now been listening to the other set. Both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. \n\nThe suede pads are definitely warmer and more relaxed, however after listening to both and EQ'ing with both, I find myself preferring the others. I don't know which are the mixing and which is the mastering set. The reason I am finding myself prefering these pads, I think, is because of the perceived extra detail from the mids and highs along with a more airy and open sense or a stage. I do understand why Sennheiser didn't have these in the 600 family, but I understand why so many have compared them, and I think there are some similarities.\n\nThe drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family (at least visually from the outside) but they provide a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the largest soundstage I‚Äôve heard from a Sennheiser, it‚Äôs not even close. In my opinion they pull this off with a sound signature that is easy to listen to but honest and competent, and definitely a Sennheiser open back. That all being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. \n\nAs someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. \n\nWeirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop‚Ä¶ I know what you want me to say, but I don‚Äôt hate them. They‚Äôre definitely not the headphone I‚Äôm going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I‚Äôm hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes.\n\nI absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is not floating my boat. I will be buying a new balanced cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro‚Äôs are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you‚Äôve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I‚Äôd love to hear other‚Äôs perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I‚Äôll get.",

    "selftext": "So you decide to upgrade your audio setup with a nice pair of headphones. BuT WhAt PaIr Of HeAdPhOnEs? You ask. Well here it is a guide to headphone tuning.\n\nSo first off there needs to be a disclaimer being no matter what headphones you buy, they will not sound perfect to you. Sonic \"perfection\" is entirely unique to you with complex ideas like HRTF and more importantly how that noggin of yours processes sounds. To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

No balanced, no DSP, just a power putton, volume dial and headphone ports. I love it. This might sound silly, but I really enjoy having dedicated 3.5mm and 1/4inch ports so I never have to use an annoying adapter anymore.\n\nI rarely see products of this company anywhere online, so I wanted to share it with you all (although you might know them by their high-end brand \"Violectric\"). This costs 240‚Ç¨, is built like a tank and - something I also rarely see marketed about - is proud of the built-in headphone protection circuits.

Also designed and built in Germany for my fellow r/BuyFromEU volks.\n\nThe DAC on-top is a Topping D10s, one of the first HiFi products I got and it runs great too. What can I say: It's a DAC. Did an AB test with other DACs and couldn't tell a difference so they really don't matter in terms of sound (for me).\n\nIf I could change anything it would be the color of the DAC, both being black would be nice.

    "selftext": "Hello, I haven‚Äôt really seen much coverage of this product online, and I thought it deserves some more attention so I will try to share my thoughts.\n\nThis headphone is not available in many countries, but I was able to buy it from Aliexpress for around ¬£20($26) including postage. A retro-style lightweight Bluetooth openback headphones from Philips to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\n\nIn this product category, the closest competitor I could think of is Koss porta pro, Kph30i or the wireless koss porta pro all of which cost more than this product. I‚Äôve also compared it to some grados and my HD6XX and HD560s.\n\nGiven the price range, I was shocked at the tonal balance and the resolution. I would say Grado and Koss both have a very distinct texture of sound that makes it sound really cheap with little bass. In my ears, Ringo definitely has a more balanced V shape sound signature and has less of that cheap texture to the sound. Given my experience and preference, I would take this over Grado SR60/80i/e or Koss porta pro/kph30 any day for its timbre and tuning even if it was the same price point.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, the resolution or timbre isn‚Äôt gonna beat an HD6XX, and the build is quite cheap. But I find the build with its metal headband more sturdy than any of the Koss headphones that can even be triple the price. For a fun sounding Bluetooth headphones with 26 hour battery, lightweight and decent retro design AND built in app eq for around ¬£20 is crazy. \n\nI‚Äôve got too many headphones and have bought all the headphones mentioned in this review, but I will be keeping these around which is the biggest compliment I can give as I have given away/sold the all the Koss products. I‚Äôm no expert and have no intention to try over selling these but for anyone who‚Äôs considering a sub 100 open back Bluetooth headphones, these are the best in my experience!",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm using my 2025 MacBook Pro as a DAC/amp and wondering which version of the Beyerdynamic DT 1770 Pro is more ideal to power directly from its headphone jack.\n\nGiven the Mac‚Äôs adaptive 1.25 V / 3 V output modes, would the 250 Œ© (mk1) or 30 Œ© (mk2) be the better match in terms of voltage headroom, damping, and overall noise performance?\n\nAlso: if you‚Äôve used both versions, did you notice any downsides with the Mark 2, like weaker bass or other trade-offs? I‚Äôm tempted to go with it for the versatility, but I don‚Äôt want to sacrifice sound quality.",

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

But in my headphones, *the difference is bigger*. I hear the mix much more spacious and clear, with more detailed highs and WAY better separation.

    "selftext": "First of all I want to emphasize - I'm by no means a audio aficionado, just ur regular hifi enjoyer I would say.  \nStarted my journey in my teens with some cheap ass amp + bookshelf setup which at the time was still way better than anything you could get from the electronic store next door.   \nAnyway back to the topic - HEADPHONES. Been using a lot of \"High-End\" Consumer Devices on the go, Sennheiser, Sony, Bose, \\*cough\\* Apple \\*cough\\* - Jokes aside, and for the past years i've been rocking my AKG K712 Pro at home being driven by my Onboard DAC/Amp on my PC.   \nThe AKG were already a WOW moment for me compared to those big brand Consumer devices at the time and to this day I love those cans. Still going strong after 10 years.   \nSound - Clear, Punchy and no headache even after hours listening at extensive volume. And the Soundstage? Phenomenal. \n\nHaving said that, I hope you got the reference to what I will be comparing the Avantone to.\n\nQuick mention - I do drive my Headphones with the Fiio K11 R2R since a couple weeks, which already improved the sound of the AKG by a mile compared to the onboard solution.\n\n\\- Avantone Planar 2 Impression starts here -\n\nOut of the box first impressions were not too overwhelming, they are fairly unimpressive at first glance from a visual standpoint, the boxy \"cheese grater\" design looks actually kinda nice in the polished black colour I got here tho.  \nBuild quality is very solid, compared to all my previous headphones which were all just big chunks of plastic you get a solid metal frame, fairly thick leather strap which also has the width to spread the enormous weight of the headphones across your head so they actually do NOT feel heavy at all.  \nThe AKG already had comfortable Velour Pads but damn, those Pads on the Avantone are silky smooth and nice to touch.\n\nNow to the sound,\n\nOut-of-the-box: Not to impressive if you ask me. I felt like something was \"missing\" compared to the AKG. Everything felt kinda flat and very narrow in comparison.  \nBy no means did they sound bad, but just.. boring?  \nHaving said that, the low-end did have more punch and they also provided more details in busy passages. It was just uninspired and so narrow, as if you were stuck in a small box.  \nAt that point I was contemplating if the price tag of 429‚Ç¨ was worth it or if I should return them.   \n  \nBut then I gave em another shot after researching a bit and applied an EQ (Self Tweaked Version of the u/Oratory1990 EQ for the first iteration of the Avantone Planar) via APO (Peace Interface) and I was simply shocked.  \nIt really opened up the stage and completely removed the feeling of being boxed in. They take the EQ as if they were made for it.   \n  \nThe low end got even more punch without any signs of being too much for the driver. The midrange is just as detailed as before but the elevated treble is what enhances the whole experience to new heights. As I described earlier everything sounds alive, the stage is wider and most importantly - It's fun! (Which I feel like is a point a lot of people forget to talk about)  \n\n\nBy no means do I have the equipment to measure those things or the extensive knowledge to compare it to hundred other headphones in different price brackets.   \nI cant tell you, especially after applying the EQ, if they follow some imaginary \"perfect\" frequency response curve.  \nAll I can say is - I love those things after applying the EQ and will keep them for a long time to come! \n\nThat is all from me, if there is anything you would like me to add feel free to ask in the comments as this is my first \"review\" I probably missed a ton of important stuff.\n\nCheers y'all!",

    "selftext": "So say I'm watching Netflix on my TV at night, and I'm listening on my headphones so as to not bother the neighbors.  The audio signal is going from a Firestick, to the TV, through an optical cable, across the room to an SMSL SU1 DAC, into a Douk U3 headphone amp, into a pair of Sennhieser 598's.\n\nThat's all well and good, except it requires a cable to be lying across the floor of my living room from my TV to the couch area.\n\nOne wireless alternatively obviously would be some kind of Bluetooth receiver, but I hear that results in decreased sound quality?\n\nIs there any other wireless way to transmit the signal across the room from my TV to my DAC?  Is this something that a Wiim can do, for example?",

    "selftext": "I got the Topping DX5 II a couple of months ago, and now got around to ordering some feet so that I can stack it on top of the High-Amp Antares. Feet are cheapish metal \"isolation\" spikes. Those were the nicest looking solution for getting the necessary ventilation clearance between the two amps.\n\nThe DX5 II is a really neat little box full of features and with all the power I need. Moved the previous Topping E50/L50 stack to my study. No need for any other DAC/amps until something breaks.\n\nThe Antares is for my Stax and the hopefully soon repaired Sennheiser HE-60. More affordable than an equally powerful amp from Stax, and nice to have something hand-made in Germany, but it could really be a bit smaller.\n\nI got the Little Dot MK2 on a whim last year and very occasionally use it with my HD800. My impression is that it does something pleasing to the staging and shaves off most of the micro details, which can be relaxing depending on the mood and music. Despite recommendations it is  not good with the HD580 which, to me, already lacks resolution. Need to set up an A/B comparison one of these days to see if I am just imagining things. \n\nHeadphones are Stax Lambda Nova Basic, which I got for cheap with one of the utter crap Stay entry level amps.",

Personally, I‚Äôm not a believer in all that snake oil ‚Äî people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don‚Äôt buy it. And honestly, I don‚Äôt think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I‚Äôve always thought that if there‚Äôs any difference, it‚Äôs basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time ‚Äî I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a ‚Äúbigger soundstage,‚Äù I just assume it‚Äôs because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I‚Äôm open-minded ‚Äî I‚Äôll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that‚Äôs matched, everything else ‚Äî bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging ‚Äî sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I‚Äôm out. Either they‚Äôre trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don‚Äôt. In either case, their opinions don‚Äôt mean much to me anymore, because I can‚Äôt hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let‚Äôs talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn‚Äôt tell exactly what at first, but it didn‚Äôt feel like my imagination. After more testing ‚Äî switching headphones, replaying the same tracks ‚Äî I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head ‚Äî especially those higher notes ‚Äî in a way the K7 doesn‚Äôt. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that‚Äôs somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it‚Äôs like their voice locks into one spot ‚Äî more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this ‚Äî it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you ‚Äî same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat‚Äôs not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer‚Äôs right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste ‚Äî some benefit from that extra space, some don‚Äôt. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** ‚Äî *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn‚Äôt huge, but it‚Äôs there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It‚Äôs actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it‚Äôs slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less ‚Äúexciting.‚Äù The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah ‚Äî I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It‚Äôs pricey, and there‚Äôs no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat‚Äôs my honest take.",

    "selftext": "I ordered the AC45 from Aune's Official Store (mall.auneaudio.com) as I wasn't sure how long it would be before they're more widely available in the US and whether they would be carried by any of their distributors since they're a fairly niche product category. Shipping to the US was free which is nice but at no point was there any mention that they wouldn't handle import fees (tariffs) on their end before the product was shipped and I didn't think anything of it since I've had multiple orders from China where the seller handled everything ahead of time which is the proper way to do it. Today I got an email from UPS that I need to pay for the import fees on a shipment and I knew right away what it was for, ended up paying $27 of which $15 went to UPS for their BS charges to handle the import paperwork and processing. I'm a little annoyed at Aune since not only do they not mention this on their website or at checkout but they also picked the worst possible shipping option since DHL, FedEx, and UPS are known to be POS companies that charge extra fees on top of the actual import fee for essentially doing nothing. If they had shipped it via the postal service it wouldn't have been as big of an issue since they won't charge that extra fee and I would've only had to pay $12 in stead of $27. So if you're in the US and are thinking about ordering from Aune directly be prepared to pay extra on top of what the item costs, it's worth getting their products through other sellers if you can even if the price is slightly higher than their own store is selling them for to avoid these extra charges and the added hassle.\n\nP.S. I know that Aune isn't entirely to blame since this wouldn't be an issue at all if it wasn't for the current joke of an administration pretending to run this country but it's also the current reality that we're forced to live with and other companies have handled it much better than Aune has. If they had taken the time to figure out what the best option was instead of basically ignoring it and making their customers deal with the aftermath this wouldn't be an issue.",

    "title": "CVJ Neko: CVJ Neko: bass that hits and voices that whisper.",
    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n‚Üí Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n‚Üí Punchy bass.  \n‚Üí Delicious female vocals.  \n‚Üí Soundstage above average.  \n‚Üí No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n‚Üí DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n‚Üí If you are a purist, stay away.  \n‚Üí Mids somewhat soft.  \n‚Üí Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30‚Ç¨/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a ‚Äúmore and better.‚Äù\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:**¬†present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:**¬†this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:**¬†here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:**¬†somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:**¬†maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:**¬†with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:**¬†substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:**¬†too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:**¬†I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:**¬†at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:**¬†placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:**¬†keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:**¬†could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:**¬†testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko‚Äôs character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos‚Äô voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:**¬†testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once‚Ä¶ I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:**¬†dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:**¬†not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:**¬†paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:**¬†I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it‚Äôs unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you have fun‚Äù vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I had a go at processing the HUTUBS data, which are in ear measurements of the HRTFs and HD 800 S for 96 subjects, and the HD 650 for 64 subjects.\n\nMy intent was to compare the accuracy of the gras and bk5128 rigs to real heads. Each measurement is compensated to the diffuse field curve of the respective head with a -1 dB slope. By compensating to that target we are in effect \"subtracting\" the effect of each individuals ear geometry and are left with only the perceived variation in frequency response between heads caused by the acoustic impedance of the headphone.\n\nHD 800 S:\n\nBoth measurement rigs rise up to 4kHz too quickly and also show the first peak occurring closer to 6k, while real heads show it occuring around 5k. Using a tone generator I can hear it peaking at 5.2khz on my head. The second peak occurs around 7k in HUTUBS. On my head I can hear it around 7.2kHz. Both rigs show it closer to 8 kHz.\n\nUsing this as a basis for EQ results in a much more pleasing sound than the harman target profiles which don't deal with these peaks adequality.\n\nHD 650:\n\nThe HD 650 shows a lot more variance, despite that, there are features in the response that aren't present on either GRAS or BK rig. The first being a peak at 5kHz. Using a tone generator I can hear this very clearly on my head. Then there is a strong recession between 6k and 8k Hz which the gras rig doesn't show clearly.\n\nUsing this as a basis to EQ results in these two headphones sounding the most similar I've ever heard two different models of headphone sound (albeit still different).\n\nI've included headphones.coms processing of the same data for 30 heads, and the results seem similar.\n\nMy take away from this is despite the variance of the results between heads there is a clear average or trend in terms of the most common locations for peaks and dips, and neither of the most common industry standard rigs match it.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe HUTUBS, GRAS and BK5128 measurements all use different units. HD 800 S unit variation is incredibly good so hopefully this isn't an issue. I sourced the GRAS measurements from crinacle and the BK5128 measurements from earphones archive, and overlayed them on top of crinacles measurement.",

And for this price i except a premium consistent experience, NOT this!\n\nAnd secondly, also only the left side earpad makes a mild squeaky toy noise when pressed, but right earpad is dead SILENT even when it's pressed. Is this is how it is suppose to be? Also ironically when earpads were interchanged, SURPRISE surprise! STILL only left side earpads makes this mild squeaky noise when pressed and whilst trying to wear it! (Despite the same earpad when on the right driver is dead SILENT and left earpads is silent on right?!)\n\nAnd thirdly!, the return policy is NON-EXISTENT! In my country!  And when asked about it throught their painfully call with executive they said RESET IT which I had already done MULTIPLE TIMES and tried MULTIPLE DEVICES from latest Android, IPAD AND MacBook Pro.

Can you guys as confirm this for me and also other FUTURE BUYERS. Can you check and test in SILENT room with pausing after playing music.\n\nLastly, is this the QUALITY CONTROL by a 'TRUSTED' german brand?

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. \n\nAfter many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to expand the rapidly growing collection and snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they‚Äôd be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. \n\nAfter about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. All the things the 600 family can‚Äôt do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. I would even say that I feel let down by the vocal presentation of the HD490 Pro's either, so I think it may just be some rose tinted glasses effect as I haven't owned my 6XX in nearly 4 years. Anyway, I started by just listening to the suede pads for the first 3-4 hours, and have now been listening to the other set. Both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. \n\nThe suede pads are definitely warmer and more relaxed, however after listening to both and EQ'ing with both, I find myself preferring the others. I don't know which are the mixing and which is the mastering set. The reason I am finding myself prefering these pads, I think, is because of the perceived extra detail from the mids and highs along with a more airy and open sense or a stage. I do understand why Sennheiser didn't have these in the 600 family, but I understand why so many have compared them, and I think there are some similarities.\n\nThe drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family (at least visually from the outside) but they provide a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the largest soundstage I‚Äôve heard from a Sennheiser, it‚Äôs not even close. In my opinion they pull this off with a sound signature that is easy to listen to but honest and competent, and definitely a Sennheiser open back. That all being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. \n\nAs someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. \n\nWeirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop‚Ä¶ I know what you want me to say, but I don‚Äôt hate them. They‚Äôre definitely not the headphone I‚Äôm going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I‚Äôm hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes.\n\nI absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is not floating my boat. I will be buying a new balanced cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro‚Äôs are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you‚Äôve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I‚Äôd love to hear other‚Äôs perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I‚Äôll get.",

    "selftext": "So you decide to upgrade your audio setup with a nice pair of headphones. BuT WhAt PaIr Of HeAdPhOnEs? You ask. Well here it is a guide to headphone tuning.\n\nSo first off there needs to be a disclaimer being no matter what headphones you buy, they will not sound perfect to you. Sonic \"perfection\" is entirely unique to you with complex ideas like HRTF and more importantly how that noggin of yours processes sounds. To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

Either it sounded dull, the UX was bad or I just plain didn't like using it.\n\nHaving tried mostly chinese stuff, I finally wanted to try something completly different and it paid off.\n\nMy recent purchase was the Lake People G101 a simple, anlog headphone amp. No balanced, no DSP, just a power putton, volume dial and headphone ports. I love it. This might sound silly, but I really enjoy having dedicated 3.5mm and 1/4inch ports so I never have to use an annoying adapter anymore.\n\nI rarely see products of this company anywhere online, so I wanted to share it with you all (although you might know them by their high-end brand \"Violectric\"). This costs 240‚Ç¨, is built like a tank and - something I also rarely see marketed about - is proud of the built-in headphone protection circuits. Let's hope I don't need them but it's nice to see thought given to that part of the device. Also designed and built in Germany for my fellow r/BuyFromEU volks.\n\nThe DAC on-top is a Topping D10s, one of the first HiFi products I got and it runs great too. What can I say: It's a DAC. Did an AB test with other DACs and couldn't tell a difference so they really don't matter in terms of sound (for me).\n\nIf I could change anything it would be the color of the DAC, both being black would be nice. But other than that I am so happy and juet feel peace with this setup. It sounds great, has lots of power and will hopefully last me a long time.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I haven‚Äôt really seen much coverage of this product online, and I thought it deserves some more attention so I will try to share my thoughts.\n\nThis headphone is not available in many countries, but I was able to buy it from Aliexpress for around ¬£20($26) including postage. A retro-style lightweight Bluetooth openback headphones from Philips to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\n\nIn this product category, the closest competitor I could think of is Koss porta pro, Kph30i or the wireless koss porta pro all of which cost more than this product. I‚Äôve also compared it to some grados and my HD6XX and HD560s.\n\nGiven the price range, I was shocked at the tonal balance and the resolution. I would say Grado and Koss both have a very distinct texture of sound that makes it sound really cheap with little bass. In my ears, Ringo definitely has a more balanced V shape sound signature and has less of that cheap texture to the sound. Given my experience and preference, I would take this over Grado SR60/80i/e or Koss porta pro/kph30 any day for its timbre and tuning even if it was the same price point.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, the resolution or timbre isn‚Äôt gonna beat an HD6XX, and the build is quite cheap. But I find the build with its metal headband more sturdy than any of the Koss headphones that can even be triple the price. For a fun sounding Bluetooth headphones with 26 hour battery, lightweight and decent retro design AND built in app eq for around ¬£20 is crazy. \n\nI‚Äôve got too many headphones and have bought all the headphones mentioned in this review, but I will be keeping these around which is the biggest compliment I can give as I have given away/sold the all the Koss products. I‚Äôm no expert and have no intention to try over selling these but for anyone who‚Äôs considering a sub 100 open back Bluetooth headphones, these are the best in my experience!",

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

    "selftext": "First of all I want to emphasize - I'm by no means a audio aficionado, just ur regular hifi enjoyer I would say.  \nStarted my journey in my teens with some cheap ass amp + bookshelf setup which at the time was still way better than anything you could get from the electronic store next door.   \nAnyway back to the topic - HEADPHONES. Been using a lot of \"High-End\" Consumer Devices on the go, Sennheiser, Sony, Bose, \\*cough\\* Apple \\*cough\\* - Jokes aside, and for the past years i've been rocking my AKG K712 Pro at home being driven by my Onboard DAC/Amp on my PC.   \nThe AKG were already a WOW moment for me compared to those big brand Consumer devices at the time and to this day I love those cans. Still going strong after 10 years.   \nSound - Clear, Punchy and no headache even after hours listening at extensive volume. And the Soundstage? Phenomenal. \n\nHaving said that, I hope you got the reference to what I will be comparing the Avantone to.\n\nQuick mention - I do drive my Headphones with the Fiio K11 R2R since a couple weeks, which already improved the sound of the AKG by a mile compared to the onboard solution.\n\n\\- Avantone Planar 2 Impression starts here -\n\nOut of the box first impressions were not too overwhelming, they are fairly unimpressive at first glance from a visual standpoint, the boxy \"cheese grater\" design looks actually kinda nice in the polished black colour I got here tho.  \nBuild quality is very solid, compared to all my previous headphones which were all just big chunks of plastic you get a solid metal frame, fairly thick leather strap which also has the width to spread the enormous weight of the headphones across your head so they actually do NOT feel heavy at all.  \nThe AKG already had comfortable Velour Pads but damn, those Pads on the Avantone are silky smooth and nice to touch.\n\nNow to the sound,\n\nOut-of-the-box: Not to impressive if you ask me. I felt like something was \"missing\" compared to the AKG. Everything felt kinda flat and very narrow in comparison.  \nBy no means did they sound bad, but just.. boring?  \nHaving said that, the low-end did have more punch and they also provided more details in busy passages. It was just uninspired and so narrow, as if you were stuck in a small box.  \nAt that point I was contemplating if the price tag of 429‚Ç¨ was worth it or if I should return them.   \n  \nBut then I gave em another shot after researching a bit and applied an EQ (Self Tweaked Version of the u/Oratory1990 EQ for the first iteration of the Avantone Planar) via APO (Peace Interface) and I was simply shocked.  \nIt really opened up the stage and completely removed the feeling of being boxed in. They take the EQ as if they were made for it.   \n  \nThe low end got even more punch without any signs of being too much for the driver. The midrange is just as detailed as before but the elevated treble is what enhances the whole experience to new heights. As I described earlier everything sounds alive, the stage is wider and most importantly - It's fun! (Which I feel like is a point a lot of people forget to talk about)  \n\n\nBy no means do I have the equipment to measure those things or the extensive knowledge to compare it to hundred other headphones in different price brackets.   \nI cant tell you, especially after applying the EQ, if they follow some imaginary \"perfect\" frequency response curve.  \nAll I can say is - I love those things after applying the EQ and will keep them for a long time to come! \n\nThat is all from me, if there is anything you would like me to add feel free to ask in the comments as this is my first \"review\" I probably missed a ton of important stuff.\n\nCheers y'all!",

It delivers dynamic, crystal-clear audio with a wide soundstage and stunning detail. Paired with the Arya Organic, it's a near-perfect match for me, of course, within this price range.\n\nHowever, when it comes to vocals, film scores, classic rock, or pop, the DX5 II can feel a bit too clinical,,almost overly precise. That‚Äôs exactly why I decided to try the K13, hoping for a warmer, more organic presentation thanks to the R2R DAC.\n\nA/B testing starts today, and I‚Äôll share a more detailed review over the weekend. If you‚Äôve got experience with the K13 or other R2R DACs, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!",

    "title": "Can't ReImage SteamDeck",
    "selftext": "My SteamDeck has been pretty buggy ever since I got it a few years ago. I've always had trouble updating it. A few weeks ago I finally got tired of the poor performance and the freezing when I try to do updates, so I decided to try a factory reset. I was unable to do this - it kept telling me that I wasn't connected to the internet even though I was. I did some digging and found that reimaging the deck might help.\n\nI'm following the directions here:¬†[https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227)\n\nAt first I was using a Windows computer so I downloaded first rufus-4.9 and then tried rufus-4.10\\_BETA. I had to purchase a thumbdrive because I didn't have anything that would go into SteamDeck's ports or any adapters so I got this:¬†[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSW6375K?ref=ppx\\_yo2ov\\_dt\\_b\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSW6375K?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)\n\nI downloaded the file from here:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download/?ver=steamdeck&snr=100601\\_\\_\\_](https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download/?ver=steamdeck&snr=100601___)\n\nI opened up rufus (I've tried both the versions I listed above with the same results) and I've uploaded both the zipped up folder and an extracted file from the folder at different times to see if that made a difference (hasn't seemed to but it would make more sense for the extracted file to be the right way to do things?).\n\nI powered on the deck while holding volume up, and then went to the boot manager, plugged in the thumbdrive, and then selected the EFI USB Device and that's where progress stops.\n\nAfter I select the EFI USB my SteamDeck will show the Steam logo for a few seconds before displaying a bunch of processes in code. I'm not someone who understands any of that but a couple of the times its done this its had several different errors at different times.\n\nOne of the errors was something along the lines of \"failed to start append steamos\" and another time one was something along the lines of \"failed to start flush journal to persistent storage.\"\n\nAt this point in general I could not use menus to turn on, turn off, or restart the SteamDeck. I could only hold the power button to change the on/off state. I couldn't install anything, updates or otherwise - when it displayed an installing screen I got the three minutes progress bar and when I got to 1 second left it stopped - one night I literally left it on that screen for six hours and no progress. I could only access the select language and select internet menus sometimes but could never go further than that because then it begins installing...something again and I hit that forever one second away situation.\n\nToday I used a brand new Macbook Pro running Sequioa 15.6 with BalenaEtcher to start the whole process over. I powered on the deck while holding volume up, and then went to the boot manager, plugged in the thumbdrive, and then selected the EFI USB Device. It did some stuff I didn't understand, went black, and according to the instructions I needed to wait there away if it stayed black. I waited for two hours and it seemed the Deck went to sleep so I pushed the power button once. Now its running through endless code really fast and I have no hope of understanding it. Its been doing this for at least three hours now.\n\nI'm pulling my hair out. I've already made one purchase to fix the thing, I've used several versions of rufus, and now I've tried balenaEtcher. I've deleted and redownloaded and deleted and redownloaded the image file multiple times, reformatted the thumbdrive multiple times, and tried to boot with the USB from boot manager several times. Its like a death spiral. What am I missing? I'm not a computer coder so this is already frustrating and over my head.\n\n  \nEdit: Fixed a typo and a timeline error.",

This is all via the official dock too. I also have a problem where the colors are super saturated and I have to use the Developer Mode to disable automatic color correction but sometimes it just turns itself off!\n\nI'm so dissatisfied with this situation. I knew when I wanted a Steam Deck I would be using it both Docked and Handheld and switching between the two quite often but this has made me never want to plug it up. Someone please help if you can. Would a factory reset work? I don't care about reinstalling shit at this point. I just wanna be able to use my Steam Deck how I want, when I want. Does Bazzite have this trouble? I've been thinking of giving it a try as well if this problem consists. That or trying a 3rd party dock. ",

The battery % has dropped to 45 since then and the battery health is at 88% but when its plugged in it shows as \"not charging\" in desktop mode. \n\n\nAnyone have any ideas?\n\n\nThanks!!",

    "selftext": "Hey all, first time poster here. Had my deck for about a year a love the damn thing. Currently trying to get a sinden lightgun to work with it, and it looks like I have to rollback the firmware and or disable the joystick mode which means accessing the sinden software which only in possible through windows. As the title states the solution I've been pointed to is to get windows flashed to this micro sd and using the boot menu to load windows from it so I can do windows shit with this guns software to get it running. Im having issues when trying to use balena etcher to flash the image as it gives me a missing partitions error.. Been looking into ways to solve this which pointer to using kde partition manager to format the card properly but when I get the card selected in it kde tells me I won't be able to edit it? Been looking into trying to use something  like proton tricks which I already have on the deck but when I try to open the mediacretiontool.exe via proton tricks and this is where I am currently lost. There are only 2 prefixes to select one of them being  the sinden driver i was running in desktop the only other being the house of the dead as an application. I don't even know how these got added lol Or if im even barking up the wrong tree. My goal is mostly just to get windows access on here, any help is greatly appreciated ‚úå ",

    "title": "Can't ReImage SteamDeck",
    "selftext": "My SteamDeck has been pretty buggy ever since I got it a few years ago. I've always had trouble updating it. A few weeks ago I finally got tired of the poor performance and the freezing when I try to do updates, so I decided to try a factory reset. I was unable to do this - it kept telling me that I wasn't connected to the internet even though I was. I did some digging and found that reimaging the deck might help.\n\nI'm following the directions here:¬†[https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227)\n\nAt first I was using a Windows computer so I downloaded first rufus-4.9 and then tried rufus-4.10\\_BETA. I had to purchase a thumbdrive because I didn't have anything that would go into SteamDeck's ports or any adapters so I got this:¬†[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSW6375K?ref=ppx\\_yo2ov\\_dt\\_b\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSW6375K?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)\n\nI downloaded the file from here:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download/?ver=steamdeck&snr=100601\\_\\_\\_](https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download/?ver=steamdeck&snr=100601___)\n\nI opened up rufus (I've tried both the versions I listed above with the same results) and I've uploaded both the zipped up folder and an extracted file from the folder at different times to see if that made a difference (hasn't seemed to but it would make more sense for the extracted file to be the right way to do things?).\n\nI powered on the deck while holding volume up, and then went to the boot manager, plugged in the thumbdrive, and then selected the EFI USB Device and that's where progress stops.\n\nAfter I select the EFI USB my SteamDeck will show the Steam logo for a few seconds before displaying a bunch of processes in code. I'm not someone who understands any of that but a couple of the times its done this its had several different errors at different times.\n\nOne of the errors was something along the lines of \"failed to start append steamos\" and another time one was something along the lines of \"failed to start flush journal to persistent storage.\"\n\nAt this point in general I could not use menus to turn on, turn off, or restart the SteamDeck. I could only hold the power button to change the on/off state. I couldn't install anything, updates or otherwise - when it displayed an installing screen I got the three minutes progress bar and when I got to 1 second left it stopped - one night I literally left it on that screen for six hours and no progress. I could only access the select language and select internet menus sometimes but could never go further than that because then it begins installing...something again and I hit that forever one second away situation.\n\nToday I used a brand new Macbook Pro running Sequioa 15.6 with BalenaEtcher to start the whole process over. I powered on the deck while holding volume up, and then went to the boot manager, plugged in the thumbdrive, and then selected the EFI USB Device. It did some stuff I didn't understand, went black, and according to the instructions I needed to wait there away if it stayed black. I waited for two hours and it seemed the Deck went to sleep so I pushed the power button once. Now its running through endless code really fast and I have no hope of understanding it. Its been doing this for at least three hours now.\n\nI'm pulling my hair out. I've already made one purchase to fix the thing, I've used several versions of rufus, and now I've tried balenaEtcher. I've deleted and redownloaded and deleted and redownloaded the image file multiple times, reformatted the thumbdrive multiple times, and tried to boot with the USB from boot manager several times. Its like a death spiral. What am I missing? I'm not a computer coder so this is already frustrating and over my head.\n\n  \nEdit: Fixed a typo and a timeline error.",

As I was messing around with it I thought \" why have a PC now?\" My PC is pretty powerful but I'm not a huge nut for max performance and fidelity anymore. Since I'm already playing games mostly on the couch with a controller, why not just get rid of the PC and keep the PS5?\n\nI will still have access to my steam library through the steam deck which I use quite often. Any games that are more demanding I can use the PS5 for. \n\nIf I need a computer for anything other than gaming, I can use the steam deck. I currently have it hooked up to a dock on a desk to monitors like a computer anyway. I also have a pretty cheap laptop just in case. \n\nI'm trying to think of any reasons to keep the PC but I can't given my scenario. Thoughts?",

Not using those multi-sockets that also power the rest of the setup?

Currently trying to get a sinden lightgun to work with it, and it looks like I have to rollback the firmware and or disable the joystick mode which means accessing the sinden software which only in possible through windows. As the title states the solution I've been pointed to is to get windows flashed to this micro sd and using the boot menu to load windows from it so I can do windows shit with this guns software to get it running. Im having issues when trying to use balena etcher to flash the image as it gives me a missing partitions error.. Been looking into ways to solve this which pointer to using kde partition manager to format the card properly but when I get the card selected in it kde tells me I won't be able to edit it? Been looking into trying to use something  like proton tricks which I already have on the deck but when I try to open the mediacretiontool.exe via proton tricks and this is where I am currently lost. There are only 2 prefixes to select one of them being  the sinden driver i was running in desktop the only other being the house of the dead as an application. I don't even know how these got added lol Or if im even barking up the wrong tree. My goal is mostly just to get windows access on here, any help is greatly appreciated ‚úå ",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI recently found out about those commercial ‚Äúsecurity fog‚Äù systems shops use ‚Äî the ones that instantly fill a room with thick but harmless fog so it‚Äôs harder for someone to see/grab stuff. The concept is perfect for what I want, but the real units I‚Äôve found are $$$ (I keep seeing $2‚Äì3k+), which is way out of my range.\n\nI‚Äôm trying to do a budget/DIY version for a small apartment/home setup.\n\n**What I‚Äôm trying to do:**\n\n* I already have a SimpliSafe alarm system.\n* SimpliSafe only talks to SimpliSafe gear, so I was thinking of using a side channel (like having it text/call a number I control) and then having a Raspberry Pi / Arduino listen for that and fire a relay.\n* When it fires, I want:\n   1. A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that‚Äôs actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won‚Äôt wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20‚Äì30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** ‚Äì Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the ‚Äúsafe default‚Äù for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** ‚Äì Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that‚Äôs meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** ‚Äì Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** ‚Äì if anyone has done the ‚Äúalarm ‚Üí webhook/SMS ‚Üí Pi ‚Üí relay ‚Üí device‚Äù pattern, I‚Äôd love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it‚Äôs just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = ‚Äúleave now.‚Äù\n\nIf this isn‚Äôt allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

Not to mention the glare from the sun in the summer months. My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter.

For example for streaming I want it to turn on automatically but when I want to spin some vinyl records, I want to turn it on physically. I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home.

I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.\n\nEdit: turning the lights to a set timer as opposed to sunrise/sunset seemed to fix the issue. Had my phone on airplane mode during when the lights were supposed to turn on and they did. ",

Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n¬†\n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n¬†\n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n¬†\n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered).¬†\n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n¬†\n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Tr√•dfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n¬†\n\nAm I missing anything?",

This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5).

Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

I'm considering buying one secondhand, anyone got one handy and wants to sell at a reasonable price?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, we are working on something and I'd like to know your honest opinion, sort of a sense-check.\n\nIt's a tool (or rather a suite of tools) that guides you step by step through the process of building and maintaining a smart home. A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe‚Äôre still in development and not selling anything yet ‚Äî just trying to see if there‚Äôs real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

But I'm also going through a lot of big life changes right now that having a little help from an at home assistant type device would be super helpful where I can just tell it a thing and it will remind me or add it to other devices and stuff like that. I'm also getting some home security stuff (free through my internet provider), but being able to connect all that stuff together or having all the devices stuff connected to my phone & the Alexa would be so helpful and maybe help me understand some of it a bit better. I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

I've seen recommendations for [Bond bridge](https://a.co/d/4RCuARg) and [ZEN32 (Zooz 800 Series Z-Wave Long Range Scene Controller)](https://a.co/d/93A8hFV). Would I **NEED** both? or would just the switch work fine by itself?\n\nAny other recommendations?",

The concept is perfect for what I want, but the real units I‚Äôve found are $$$ (I keep seeing $2‚Äì3k+), which is way out of my range.\n\nI‚Äôm trying to do a budget/DIY version for a small apartment/home setup.\n\n**What I‚Äôm trying to do:**\n\n* I already have a SimpliSafe alarm system.\n* SimpliSafe only talks to SimpliSafe gear, so I was thinking of using a side channel (like having it text/call a number I control) and then having a Raspberry Pi / Arduino listen for that and fire a relay.\n* When it fires, I want:\n   1. A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that‚Äôs actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won‚Äôt wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20‚Äì30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** ‚Äì Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the ‚Äúsafe default‚Äù for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** ‚Äì Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that‚Äôs meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** ‚Äì Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** ‚Äì if anyone has done the ‚Äúalarm ‚Üí webhook/SMS ‚Üí Pi ‚Üí relay ‚Üí device‚Äù pattern, I‚Äôd love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it‚Äôs just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = ‚Äúleave now.‚Äù\n\nIf this isn‚Äôt allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I have moved into a house with 12 massive skylights in the kitchen extension which look beautiful and im loathed to cover them at all but as I am so overlooked by the neighbours to the left and also at night, any light from the kitchen travels all through the house, keeping everyone awake. Not to mention the glare from the sun in the summer months. My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter. So just want to make sure im not going to be left with a permanent install i will hate. Please advise.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dik98j6336yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd4bbf8867ff80c1d200863bd763861ea8117c60\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efo49k2636yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d1adf32542880f2121f73e03474a770ecb68305\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, it‚Äôs my first time posting in this community.\n\nI am looking for recommendations for a wireless intercom system with multiple lines. The goal is this:\n\nMy boss wants to have an intercom that can connect to three different offices within the same building (~40-50 ft in distance from eachother). We purchased a wuloo intercom but he does not like having to remember the channels for each office. Ideally, this intercom system will have just a single button where he can press and instantly connect to any of the offices individually. It needs to be wireless and battery operated. TIA!",

Meaning I can send a signal to _something_ to turn on when music starts playing.\n\nI suspect that something can be some sort of a 220v plug that connects an extension with multiple sockets where all the gear is plugged in. \n\nThat something must have some sort of way to turn on/off programatically and must be overriden physically. For example for streaming I want it to turn on automatically but when I want to spin some vinyl records, I want to turn it on physically. I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home. Rpi cannot be hidden well due to fairly weak wifi reception\n\nThanks guys! ",

I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess. \n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!",

I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.\n\nEdit: turning the lights to a set timer as opposed to sunrise/sunset seemed to fix the issue.

Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n¬†\n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n¬†\n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n¬†\n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered).¬†\n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n¬†\n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Tr√•dfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n¬†\n\nAm I missing anything?",

A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that‚Äôs actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won‚Äôt wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20‚Äì30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** ‚Äì Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the ‚Äúsafe default‚Äù for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** ‚Äì Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that‚Äôs meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** ‚Äì Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** ‚Äì if anyone has done the ‚Äúalarm ‚Üí webhook/SMS ‚Üí Pi ‚Üí relay ‚Üí device‚Äù pattern, I‚Äôd love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it‚Äôs just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = ‚Äúleave now.‚Äù\n\nIf this isn‚Äôt allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I have moved into a house with 12 massive skylights in the kitchen extension which look beautiful and im loathed to cover them at all but as I am so overlooked by the neighbours to the left and also at night, any light from the kitchen travels all through the house, keeping everyone awake. Not to mention the glare from the sun in the summer months. My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter. So just want to make sure im not going to be left with a permanent install i will hate. Please advise.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dik98j6336yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd4bbf8867ff80c1d200863bd763861ea8117c60\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efo49k2636yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d1adf32542880f2121f73e03474a770ecb68305\n\n",

    "title": "Bluetti is finally getting a official Smart Home Integration!",
    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nIm Erik aka Selfmadestrom from the Bluetti community. Im working since month on the wish that people want to use Bluetti devices in their Smart Homes.\n\nFinally we can entry the last milestone on this journey. Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don‚Äôt support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "So I‚Äôve been deep in the smart lock rabbit hole lately and, man‚Ä¶ there are way too many options out there. Every brand swears theirs is ‚ÄúTHE SMARTEST‚Äù... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren‚Äôt essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it‚Äôs like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world‚Äôs ‚Äúsmart homes‚Äù catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you‚Äôre running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit ‚Äúnerd level 3000‚Äù... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone‚Äôs found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I‚Äôm cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn‚Äôt depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

Great. But I still can‚Äôt connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I‚Äôve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn‚Äôt change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically‚Ä¶ but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn‚Äôt detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I‚Äôm missing ?

The next requirement is that they have programmable sensitivity and trigger time. \n\nThanks!\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\n\nI‚Äôm tired of batteries. I cut out one use and have moved to rechargeable, mostly, but at this point I think I‚Äôm ready to just go wired where I can. It‚Äôs inconvenient to try doing this for door locks or contact sensors so I may as well target motion/presence ones. \n\nThat being said, it‚Äôs hard to get a good list of wired sensors with the options I need. I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can‚Äôt set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can‚Äôt set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I‚Äôm not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don‚Äôt have info on any wired then I‚Äôll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while. I have plenty lithium rechargeables and nimh. \n\nI do have HA but I kind of want something that works without the extra work. HA is great and all but to get it to work remotely is ‚Ä¶ no thanks. \n\nThanks!",

    "title": "Smart home Setup - internet issues",
    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed ‚Äì Entry ‚Äì Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "title": "Dark Apartment - need ideas / solutions",
    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I have a very simple heater my garage with an old-school thermostat.  I need to integrate this and have a Zooz Zen16 \"dry contact\" Multirelay to use but am unclear on how to actually wire the heater into this.  I have separate power inputs into the unit which is solved but I have 2 wires from the unit which don't make sense to me on how to connect them.  I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?  I can do all of the other bits but translating from these 2 wires to something else seems to be breaking my brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrjye1zgvxf1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=72379c7a66a60690a24cd86633780ac3f8fb97d8\n\n",

The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit? Looking at the ecobee and the nest, but not sure if either one will give us an advantage with our current setup.\n\nThoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

    "selftext": "There must be a way to fix this. I just replaced a years old Nest Hello (wired) doorbell camera with a new Nest wired 3rd Gen doorbell.  The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said ‚Äúno‚Äù and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

    "selftext": "Hi, I need some advice please.  I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don‚Äôt support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

Every brand swears theirs is ‚ÄúTHE SMARTEST‚Äù... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren‚Äôt essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it‚Äôs like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world‚Äôs ‚Äúsmart homes‚Äù catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you‚Äôre running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit ‚Äúnerd level 3000‚Äù... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone‚Äôs found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I‚Äôm cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn‚Äôt depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys, thanks for all the great ideas I‚Äôve found here, my smart home setup‚Äôs been going pretty smoothly. I‚Äôve got the basics covered so far: a dishwasher, robot vacuum for cleaning, AC and central ventilation, a smart lock and cameras for security, plus whole-house lighting control and electric curtains.\n\nNow I‚Äôm thinking of adding something a bit different next, maybe for the shower room or the room that opens onto the balcony. I‚Äôve been looking at a window cleaning robot that seems great for those big balcony windows. It needs to be placed on the window manually, but once it‚Äôs on, it can clean automatically. I guess it might also work for shower glass.\n\nI‚Äôm also thinking about trying a sunrise light on the balcony that syncs with my main lighting setup. Has anyone tried either of these? I‚Äôm leaning toward winbot for the window cleaning, but I haven‚Äôt found a sunrise light that fits into my google home setup yet.\n\nIf you‚Äôve tried any uncommon or creative smart home gadgets, I‚Äôd love to hear what worked for you. Thanks!",

I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

Unfortunately range issues still exist such that the two farthest bulbs seem to disconnect. Usually individually, today as a pair. I'm going to reset and move my extender, but it's starting to be a headache. I recently started with the Tapo bridge to fold in kasa with the tapo dimmer / button, which doesn't seem to work from the start. It says I've paired the two bulbs, but only one seems to dim per the button, but both do turn on (and maybe not off). I specifically purchased the bridge to accommodate this. Does anyone have any insight, besides just trying to reset, relocate or reboot? I'm considering going full into Homeassistant, but I have enough moving parts at the moment, if anyone has insight on making the switch.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nIm Erik aka Selfmadestrom from the Bluetti community. Im working since month on the wish that people want to use Bluetti devices in their Smart Homes.\n\nFinally we can entry the last milestone on this journey. Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don‚Äôt support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "I have an outdoor smart double socket made by Luceco / BG Home which powers my string lights and fountain, via an app on my phone. I‚Äôd like to add a wireless on / off switch on the inside wall, for flatmates and visitors. So they don‚Äôt have to go to the socket outside or download the app just to turn off or on the outdoor lights.\nLuceco says the socket can only be managed in their own app and they have no switches I can add and pair in the app. But the socket is IFTTT enabled. The only way to add a switch is by using IFTTT. How do I do this? I‚Äôve only set IFTTT rules on my phone, but this would be an IFTTT rule between two devices in my flat not using my phone. Can I create an IFTTT rule on my phone (‚Äúif left switch is turned on, left socket turns on‚Äù, etc) that will then work even when my phone is not involved (ie offline)?",

Textures switch from blurry to sharp right in front of me.  \nIt‚Äôs especially bad in games like Hogwarts Legacy, Starfield, Sons of the Forest, Valheim, and a few others.\n\nWhat I already tried:\n\n* Multiple clean NVIDIA driver installs (DDU, different versions)\n* Latest BIOS (1.80, April 2025) + chipset update\n* Toggled HAGS, Resizable BAR, EXPO, Game Mode on/off\n* Shader cache deleted (NVIDIA + Windows)\n* Checked PCIe (x16 @ Gen 5) and SSD performance (\\~7,000 MB/s)\n* Frame Generation / DLSS on and off\n* FPS capped / uncapped\n* Even tested with older NVIDIA drivers\n\nThe system runs flawlessly otherwise ‚Äî it‚Äôs just that textures and LODs stream in way too late.\n\nAfter weeks of searching I found tons of people describing the exact same issue in r/lod_videogames_issue  \n\n\nand [Linus Tech Tips ‚Äì ‚ÄúJagged shadows / pop-in / low LOD and jagged AA‚Äù (170+ pages)]()\n\nMany have tried everything ‚Äî swapping GPUs, PSUs, motherboards, even moving to different houses or power circuits ‚Äî and it always persists. Some think it‚Äôs an electricity or grounding issue, others believe it‚Äôs a DirectX or NVIDIA driver bug that mainly affects RTX 40/50 series.\n\nAt this point it looks like a global, unsolved problem. If anyone here has actually found a workaround or any reproducible fix, please share.Would love to at least understand what‚Äôs causing this. \n\n  \nThank you very much! ",

These ram sticks have been tested in another system and I know they work. After doing some research, it seems that linux is okay with some memory issues and will silently fail, while windows is not okay with that so that's why linux can boot but windows can't. \n\nI'm going to test each slot of ram tomorrow, and see if they fail on memtest86+ too. I can try swapping out the cpu and ssd too because they are untested but it's most likely the motherboard.\n\nDoes anyone know the common issues for a motherboard causing ram issues? Is there anything I might want to look for that maybe I can fix? I was thinking it could be the traces or there's something wrong with the cpu socket.

After doing various checks, including changing the cables, my machine was unable to detect it. I'd done some research and I found that other users with my hard drive, a Western Digital SA510, have encountered an issue that caused the drive to be permanently unrecognizable.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm still working through this issue, as there are a few reddit threads fiscussing potential fixes. However, I've subsequently noticed other strange issues that may or may not be related. For example, if my pc goes to sleep, I'm unable to wake it. The only way to start it up again is to turn off the pc. When this happens, I'll often get a startup message saying \"the (windows) update failed to install, undoing changes\". This isn't a 100% repro, but has occurred a handful of times. Additionally, I had a moment where my PC simply shut down on me. It gave me the standard \"Shutting down...\" Windows screen before turning off.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPart of me wonders if something's up with my power supply (I don't have the make and model at hand, but it's 5 years old at this point). I wonder if my hard drive failing is related to a PSU issue, or it was simply an unlucky coincidence. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to investigate?\n\nMy PC seems to be fine when I'm not hititng these issues, and all peroformance diagnostics- fan speed, temp, gpu and cpu speeds all seem fine.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, thank you for reading in advance! As the title suggests, I'm facing issues transferring data from my Google Pixel 8 to my new Samsung S25.\n\nFrom what I know, a google pixel doesn't backup any kind of data on the device itself, just in the google/gmail account. And all my gmail account storages have been maxed out for more than a year now. As a result, none of my pics, whatsapp chats, etc. have been backed up.\n\nNow when I ended up getting a S25, I didn't realize it could be an issue until I gave it some thought. Full disclosure, maybe it's obvious, but I know absolutely nothing about technology. So I held off on transferring everything myself and I took both the phones to the local electronics store who transferred the data from my Huawei Y7 Prime to the Pixel 8.\n\nThe person there confirmed my doubts and said that the tranfer will be extremely hard. It seemed like he could try something which would take a very long time and he isn't sure it'll work at all. According to him, the only way to resolve this issue in a foolproof way is to buy google storage, back everything up and then transfer it normally.\n\nI relayed all of this to my father and he thinks its not that serious of an issue and the store is trying to rip us off.\n\nSo, I turn to the people on this sub. Is there any way to transfer everything easily or is the person from the store right, and I have to buy more google storage? Any input will be helpful, thanks again!\n\nEDIT: If this is not the subreddit to post a question like this, I apologize! I'd be grateful if someone could point out the appropriate subreddit.",

    "selftext": "I've been trying to troubleshoot this issue for most of this year.\n\nWhat I've noticed is that I get random blackouts on my primary monitor when a television set is connected through HDMI - even when a DisplayPort to HDMI converter is used.\n\nSomething appears to be tripping the hot-plug detection, even when a connected TV is off or in \"sleep\", as newer sets seem to always be.\n\nI have had this happen with:\n\n\\* two video cards (a 3080 and a 5070)  \n\\* two television sets (a 2013 Phillips HDTV and a 2024 Hisense QD7)  \n\\* multiple VESA-certified DP cables  \n\\* two LG monitors  \n\\* two different HDMI cables (one 1.4 and one 2.1)  \n\\* three breaker circuits in my apartment  \n\\* connected to a UPS and connected to a power strip\n\nI was able to reliably reproduce the issue when the HDTV was powered on a different breaker line than my UPS. I began to notice that if the HDMI connector brushed up against the PC chassis in just the right way, it would trigger the exact same temporary blank-out on my DisplayPort-connected monitor, even when the TV was off.\n\nNow that I've made the upgrade to a newer TV set, I have an older Logitech audio system plugged into its headphone jack. I've noticed that when the blackouts happen at random, there is an audible click from the audio system (it stays on), the same kind of noise you would hear from connecting or disconnecting the jack.\n\nI've checked all of the wiring, done multimeter tests; I've lived in this apartment for 20 years and have never had this issue until earlier this year when I moved the PC to a location barely 20 feet from where it was before.\n\nAnd even with the same components that I first began experiencing this with, I used them in the same setup in that previous location (3080, DisplayPort, LG monitor, HDTV) and never once had this happen.\n\nI changed rooms and it was happening regularly but infrequently enough that I'd forget. Now that I've upgraded the card, the cabling, the monitor and the TV, it happens several times a day.",

    "selftext": "Hi, so I bought my MSI Vector 5070ti 2 months ago, there's this 2 games I often play. Cyberpunk 2077 and Marvel Rivals\n\nThey would often crash my laptop and would require a hard reset when I've played for a couple of hours straight (3+ hours). I thought it's probably just a driver issue so yeah never mind.\n\nI uninstalled those two games. I've been playing a lot of Ninja Gaiden 4 and WWE 2K25 lately, then it hit me, NG and WWE never crashed even once. As I was thinking about it, the common thing between Rivals and Cyberpunk is that both games use external launcher, and it's probably the launcher.\n\nTo test out my theory, I installed Rivals and Cyberpunk again last Oct 26. Rivals crashed. The following day tested out Cyberpunk, crashed also.\n\nTried NG yesterday and just left it running the whole night, never crashed. Still there when I left it.\n\nSo I think the main issue here is that when games are using external launchers, it would crash my laptop. I'm using Steam btw. Ultra 7, 32gb ram, 1 + 1tb ssd, 5070 ti are the specs of my laptop.\n\nIs there anything I should check to probably fix this? All my drivers are updated btw. Firewall is turned off.\n\nHopefully someone here can help me üëè",

    "title": "Lasting effects following Microsoft outage, a whole bunch of internet connectivity issues, not sure if me problem or them problem?",
    "selftext": "Buckle in, this one's a doozy.\n\nThis began this morning. The outage happened the night before. Last night before I went to sleep, all was working just fine. This morning, I log in to immediately get hit with a popup saying my Microsoft account can't be accessed because there's no internet connection. It's a persistent popup, I first get one that says \"no internet connection\" with 2603 as an error code. There are two options, \"try again\" and \"close.\" When I click close, it just pops up again. When I click try again, I get a window that says \"we couldn't connect you\" with HTTP 404. That window has a close button, when I click it, it goes back to the no internet button.\n\nI believe this was with 365 Co-Pilot trying to start, but was routinely failing to and would go into a loop state and cycle between \"starting\" and \"this is taking longer than expected.\" I was able to reset 365 Co-Pilot and it seemed to work again, but I don't use Co-Pilot anyway so I just uninstalled it. This made the persistent popups go away. I have Outlook on my desktop, and my work account, which is a business Outlook account, signed out. When I try to sign back in, I get the same persistent popups saying no internet. When I back out of the sign in window that stops appearing. I can still add non Outlook email accounts, at least one of them. I didn't attempt to add the others for fear they won't add again. I am still able to send and receive emails. I attempted to reset Outlook and that didn't fix the issue. They tried to get me to reinstall Outlook but the installer wouldn't start because it said I'm not connected to internet.\n\nI got in touch with Microsoft Support about this, they got me to reset a myriad of network settings to no avail. They attempted to take control of my screen, but Quick Assist also refused to allow a connection. They then told me the only way to fix this is to start a new profile and migrate everything over to it. I started doing this, and when I switched my main account to local and signed into the new account, the email still wouldn't work. I kerf\\*ckled my profiles so badly doing this, I decided to restore my PC using Veeam which last backed up yesterday morning, before the outage happened, so no big deal. I also hoped this would solve the connection issues, but it didn't. Even though my system was restored to the last fully functional state that it backed up, the problem with Outlook saying no internet connection immediately presented itself again. They wanted me to do a Windows system restore keeping apps and settings, I said I wouldn't do that because it's evident that that's not the problem, since I did a full bare metal restore of my C drive and the problem is still present.\n\nI tried a few other things. This is on a Windows 11 PC, I have a Windows 10 PC that this one replaced. My new PC has a new Microsoft account I started with a different email address, the old PC has a Microsoft account using a different email address. I got that one out and logged in, I was able to add the email address to Outlook on it, but the Microsoft Store says there's no internet connection when it's very much connected to internet. On my new PC, the Microsoft Store connects just fine. I tried adding my new Microsoft account as a second user to my old PC, and I couldn't set it up because it said no internet connection. I added my old account to this new PC, and it did add and set up, but when I tried to configure Outlook, it said, again, no internet connection.\n\nI've attempted to research this, but it seems nobody else is experiencing this. I can't find any recent forums, Reddit posts, or anything, but 365 still seems to be having outages according to Downdetector.com.\n\nSo what I'm wondering is, is this indicative of a problem on my end, or is it more likely that there are some lasting effects following the outage?\n\nUpdate: Now PhoneLink has broken. Will not connect to my phone. I reset PhoneLink, and I can't add an Android phone now. When I click Android, nothing happens. When I click iPhone, I get a QR code.\n\nPC: Alienware Aurora 16\n\nSoftware:\n\nEdition\tWindows 11 Home\n\nVersion\t25H2\n\nOS build\t26200.6899\n\nExperience\tWindows Feature Experience Pack 1000.26100.253.0",

    "selftext": "I bought an unlocked, refurbished Motorola Razr 2024+ from eBay about six months ago. It came with a one-year warranty. I use AT&T, and it worked perfectly for six months. \n\nThen, because it‚Äôs a flip phone, the screen liner developed a bubble. Motorola said that‚Äôs covered under warranty, so I sent the phone in for repair.\n\nWhile it was being serviced, I took my AT&T SIM and put it in another Android phone I had lying around,  it worked fine.\n\nWhen I got my Razr back (same physical phone), I popped my SIM back in. The phone recognized the SIM, but there was no service ‚Äî just ‚ÄúEmergency Calls Only.‚Äù\n\nI thought maybe it was the SIM, so I tried putting it back into the other phone. Now that phone no longer recognized the SIM either, even though it had worked literally five minutes before.\n\nSo, I go to an AT&T store. Spent two hours there troubleshooting: new SIM, eSIM, resets, network refreshes ‚Äî everything. Nothing worked.\n\nTwo weird things happened during all that:\n\n1. The Razr kept trying to connect to T-Mobile when we inserted the SIM.\n\n\n2. In AT&T‚Äôs system, my phone showed up as a Sony device (???).\n\n\nAT&T finally told me the phone is not compatible with their network anymore. \nEven though it was before the repair.\n\nSo I go to T-Mobile to check. They look up my IMEI and say the phone is unlocked, and they have no record of me or the phone in their system.\n\nThen I call Motorola support. After getting bounced between departments, they tell me the phone is locked to T-Mobile and requires a subsidy unlock code. But T-Mobile says it‚Äôs already unlocked on their end.\n\nSo here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at:\n\nAT&T: ‚ÄúYour phone isn‚Äôt compatible with our network.‚Äù\n\nT-Mobile: ‚ÄúYour phone is unlocked; it‚Äôs not ours.‚Äù\n\nMotorola: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs locked to T-Mobile, we can‚Äôt unlock it.‚Äù\n\n\nBasically, my unlocked phone got sent in for a warranty repair, and now it‚Äôs stuck in carrier limbo.\n\nHas anyone ever heard ofsomething \nlike this???",

I still use it on some sites that I know that I'll never leave any information on me like billing, phone or any of these stuff. I even received the infamous hacker mail that pretends to be from your own account with the person in it saying \"haha! I am in your inbox writing to you from your own mail, and your password is \\*leaked password\\*\" which obviously makes me laugh my head off because it's not, it's the password that I specifically use for sites I don't trust.\n\nStill, I can't help but wonder since anytime I use it windows defender tells me that it is known to be dangerous, do I risk anything using it specifically on unsafe sites, or not? Could it expose me in any way?\n\nIf yes, how?",

I‚Äôve been very busy working and finally found some time to relax on my computer only to find it won‚Äôt turn on. It has been about 2 ish weeks since I last was on my computer, and it worked just fine up until now. \n\nI can plug in any of my Bluetooth devices to either of the two front USB ports and they will charge (didn‚Äôt try the back USB‚Äôs)other than the USB‚Äôs, it doesn‚Äôt show any signs of life. \n\nI left it unplugged for a day and that didn‚Äôt change anything. There is a quick flash of light from the RGB halo around one of the fans if I flick the switch in the back from off to on, aside from that and the USB‚Äôs, it‚Äôs totally dead. If I press or hold the power button on top it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm doing nothing at all. \n\nIf anybody has seen symptoms like this or knows some trouble shooting I would be very grateful. I know tractors, not computers so this is totally new to me and probably need things explained in laymen‚Äôs terms. Here are the specs to the computer, if I left anything out please let me know and I‚Äôll update the post. Thank you!\n\n\nEdit:\n(I forgot to mention, about 3 days ago I noticed it was turned on, but in a hurry I left it like a goof ball and figured it would go into sleep mode, the next morning when I got home it was off and I figured it was in sleep mode, didn‚Äôt touch it till yesterday to find nothing working)\n\n‚ÄúiBUYPOWER - SlateMR Gaming Desktop‚Äù\n\nProcessor Model: AMD Ryzen 5 3000 Series\n\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060\n\nModel Number: SlatePro219A\n",

    "selftext": "Hey, I have a new gaming PC.  I'm running Win11, and the motherboard is a Gigabyte X870 Aorus Elite WIFI7.  There is an antenna required for wifi which have set up.  I'm using Audiotechnica ATH-M50x wireless headphones which I haven't had any problem connecting to from other devices including my 3 different PCs.\n\nSometimes without any warning, sound will stop in the headphones.  Maybe 5-10 seconds later the headphones will indicate they are disconnecting and then reconnecting but there is still no sound after that.  Looking at the device on the bluetooth list on my PC shows it as still disconnecting.  Often turning the headphones off and back on is required to reconnect and get sound.\n\nSo far I've been trying some basic things before getting around to more aggressive diagnosis but there's a new symptom that has stumped me.  If, when my headphones indicate they are disconnecting, I turn them off (in order to reconnect quicker), then while they are turning off my system will freeze graphically for a few seconds.  One of my monitors is plugged into the mobo because I haven't gotten around to upgrading them to the point where they can use the ports on my graphics card, but they both freeze.  I'm concerned that a bluetooth error / disconnection could have such an effect on motherboard function.  Any ideas?",

    "selftext": "Here are the facts:\n\nI am using my PC together with my TV to watch local and online content in various framerates and resolutions; this has never been an issue until recently, without any foregoing incidents like driver updates or hardware changes. The refresh rates are obviously different, 165Hz and 60Hz, same with the resolutions, 1440p and 4k. I am using a stock RTX 3080 with drivers that are always up to date, same with the rest of my setup. I could always game, work and do whatever else I wanted while having any sort of video playback on the TV without any stutter, lag, etc.\n\nSince a little while now, local, and only the local, video playback of any kind of file, any kind of resolution, bitrate, and so on, has been laggy on the second screen, for no logical reason, as nothing has changed about any part of the setup. I can still watch YouTube at 4k 60fps, or any other, higher or lower, resolution without any issues. I can literally move any open local video file in any player between the screens and watch it start to lag once the window is on the TV, while online playback is unaffected, not just on YouTube but any other streaming service as well.\n\nHere is what I have tried and why I have run out of ideas, which is why I am trying to get help here:\n\nTried different players (VLC, Pot, MPC, Photos app)\n\nTried turning on/off hardware accel on said players\n\nTried turning on/off G-Sync\n\nTried turning on/off V-Sync\n\nTried different cables to connect the TV\n\nTried reinstalling the GPU drivers\n\nTried reinstalling the players\n\nTried matching the refresh rates to 60/60; this was the only thing that fixed it but it cannot have SUDDENLY become the sole issue after YEARS of not being an issue, even while gaming at high refresh rates while watching 4k videos locally or online. But it could be a hint to a possible solution for somebody here.\n\nTried matching the resolutions to 1440/1440\n\nTried different renderers and decoders in the players\n\nTried restarting the PC (duh)\n\nTried changing process priorities\n\nTried Changing the display scaling methods between GPU and display\n\nDusted the PC\n\nChecked temps of CPU/GPU under load, all normal\n\nChecked GPU connectors and TV connectors\n\nLooked at other posts on the web regarding this issue, all of which were solved with one of the things mentioned above, just not my case.\n\nI am at a loss with this issue, as it has not existed for YEARS of owning this machine, and it makes absolutely no sense at all, as it has just suddenly started. I really, really hope someone here can figure it out. I must assume that it is some sort of software issue since there are absolutely no problems at all with video playback in any web browser.\n\n  \nEDIT 1: I should mention that the lag becomes even worse when I start doing any sort of gaming on the monitor, no matter how intense, maybe something to do with 3d applications or something. And I also forgot to say thank you in advance to anybody who is willing to sacrifice their time to help me figure this out.",

A few seconds after I connected the two I got a warning from windows saying that it detected ‚ÄúTrojan:Win32/Occamy.AB\"\n\nIt told me it quarantined it and that the only file that was affected was an auto run file. I don't know computer so I don't know what that means.\n\nThis camera is from 2008, last time it was used (it was lended out) was in 2012. It had not been used until I found it in my mom's closet. I previously connected it to my MacBook around 2023/early 24 to download some videos.\n\nI immediately clicked to have it removed and ran a quick scan that came out clean. I did a full scan and it came out clean as well\n\nI don't know if there are any next steps to take. Is that camcorder just unusable now? Or is it one specific part that I can just replace? Should I take my computer to tech support?\n\nOr is it a specific part that can be fixed?\nI also downloaded one video from the camcorder but since the scans came out clean, can I keep it? Or should I remove it immediately?",

    "selftext": "Ok so we have an 8 story 10,000 square foot office building. My issue is that the past two months the WiFi has been insanely slow and inconsistent. Here is our set up, Spectrum Fiber 500mgps into the building, connected to Fortigate firewall which is then connected to the UNIFI 48 port core network switch. Each floor has a unifi network switch that is wired down to the core switch, each floor has two UNIFI access points, one for each side of the floor. There are cat 5 ports at each workstation, when plugged in speeds are consistent and fast 490-500 mbps, but WIFI has suddenly become slow the past 2-3 months. I‚Äôm talking, .25-50 mbps and very inconsistent, sometimes you can‚Äôt even open a browser to run a speed test, other times it works ok, 120-250 Mbps, and other times it‚Äôs as if something is blocking the connection, no activity, and then it‚Äôll shoot up to 250-300 Mbps, then I‚Äôd run another speed test a few seconds later and it‚Äôll be slow again. It‚Äôs so bad an inconsistent that no one can work away from their desk and rely on the WiFi. The unifi switches and access points were installed in 2018. Not sure what to do. Our consultants are saying we need new switches and access points but I want to know what caused this sudden reduction and inconsistency in only WiFi speeds. Any advice would be appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "Environment: Windows 11, i7, Rtx 3060, Model MPNXB27280EQ. \n\n  \nEvent: Total System Unresponsive Freeze occurs at seemingly unpredictable times whilst a game is running. Game can be running only in the background, never in focus. All commands unresponsive. Usb power lost. Caps Lock and Num Lock unable to toggle feeback LED.   \n Fn + Spacebar successfully cycles keyboard backlight. Freeze occurs while plugged into manufacturer power adapter or while on battery. While frozen, plugging and unplugging AC power, system charging light does respond. Game resource demand doesn't seem relevant, since I reproduced the freeze on a wide spectrum of gaming loads. Audio snippet loops producing constant sound from speakers, rarely background youtube music will continue to play through the current song. Laptop left in Freeze state for more than 10 minutes, dump files never created. Must be forced shut down via power button hold for 5-10 seconds.\n  \nTrouble Shooting: DDU Safe Mode no Networking Nvidia Driver from latest version, First to ver566.36 (Game Ready), Then to 537.58. Utilized GPU-z to monitor temperatures while gaming. Freeze Still produced on sub 75C conditions. Ran sfc /scannow, as well DISM restore. Utilized Lenovo Vantage Hardware scan, all results passed. Used OCCT to run a combined test of all available tests. Bringing System to heaviest resource load, Temperatures to high 80s on CPU and GPU. Could not replicate the freeze. Test Ran for 1 hour. FurMark also Ran for 1 hour.  \nInteresting Development now, Laptop booted up and device manager cannot not find Nvidia Graphics card.  Upon restart graphics card was found. From here on I‚Äôll add new discoveries to the post paired with **EDIT** headings\n\nThank you for reading",

This caused 3 of my drives to get corrupt one on which i had all my minecraft worlds which were like 2 years old and on other i had all my memories, files and everything from when i was 9 or 10. I am feeling so broken rn i dont know what to do as i have accidenatlly formatted the drive on which i had my minecrfat worlds.

Any program i open it sounds like a plane taking off. Additionally, plugging the laptop in to charge results in it getting very hot.

Unfortunately acer doesnt allow you to mess with any sort of fan curve setting in the bios so thats out the question. Im not sure what to do next.

    "selftext": "So one day when I got on a call on discord with a friend he complained about hearing himself from me, which is weird because I haven't touched anything. Yesterday I got a new microphone and I tested it in a call with a friend in a group chat, he said there was no echo, then later I got on a call with another friend in a server, asked him if he hears echo and he said he does, then I go back to the other friend and ask him if he hears it and now he also says he hears it.  \nI'm using headphones and an external microphone, so it can't be that the mic is picking up the sound.  \nAlso I'm not completely sure but this seems to only happen if there is another person from a laptop/PC in the call. For example if I'm in a call with a mobile user he doesn't hear echo, but if there's a laptop/PC user and a mobile user in the call, both of them hear echo.  \nI don't think it's from Discord itself because I tested it on messenger and there's also echo for a PC/laptop user.",

    "title": "Issues with transferring data from Google Pixel 8 to Samsung S25",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, thank you for reading in advance! As the title suggests, I'm facing issues transferring data from my Google Pixel 8 to my new Samsung S25.\n\nFrom what I know, a google pixel doesn't backup any kind of data on the device itself, just in the google/gmail account. And all my gmail account storages have been maxed out for more than a year now. As a result, none of my pics, whatsapp chats, etc. have been backed up.\n\nNow when I ended up getting a S25, I didn't realize it could be an issue until I gave it some thought. Full disclosure, maybe it's obvious, but I know absolutely nothing about technology. So I held off on transferring everything myself and I took both the phones to the local electronics store who transferred the data from my Huawei Y7 Prime to the Pixel 8.\n\nThe person there confirmed my doubts and said that the tranfer will be extremely hard. It seemed like he could try something which would take a very long time and he isn't sure it'll work at all. According to him, the only way to resolve this issue in a foolproof way is to buy google storage, back everything up and then transfer it normally.\n\nI relayed all of this to my father and he thinks its not that serious of an issue and the store is trying to rip us off.\n\nSo, I turn to the people on this sub. Is there any way to transfer everything easily or is the person from the store right, and I have to buy more google storage? Any input will be helpful, thanks again!\n\nEDIT: If this is not the subreddit to post a question like this, I apologize! I'd be grateful if someone could point out the appropriate subreddit.",

My machine randomly shuts off without warning, sometimes at idle (the desktop and even the BIOS screen) and sometimes in games, including low demand ones like Roblox and R6 at all low graphics and high demand ones like Sekiro . There‚Äôs no warning, no BSOD, nothing critical in Event Viewer that points to kernel power 41. Now the pc shutting off at idle was after I updated to the most recent BIOS, mine was 2 years old and it had way less stability issues. The pc seems noticeably slower too and I‚Äôm starting to think that the BIOS update unveiled some hardware issue as all the UEFI settings are default too.\n\nMy specs are as follows:\n\nAsRock a620 AM5\nAMD Radeon rx 7800xt sapphire GDDR6\nAMD Ryzen 7800x3D 8-core\nRam: 32GB (2x16) T-Force 6000\nSsd: Kingstone kioxia-exceria 1T\nCooler mars gaming liquid 120mm\nseasonic 750W +gold\nMSI case\n120mm liquid cooler for the CPU \nCase has no rear exhaust only frontal intake\n\nMy notes:\nThe stability issues pre-BIOS update didn‚Äôt seem to subside by slightly undervolting GPU\n\nXMP profile is off\n\nMy temps never exceed 80¬∞C \n\nEvent viewer and reliability monitor show nothing conclusive\n\nThe seller barely had it for a year and didn‚Äôt use it often or for long periods of time\n\nSince my temps are relatively chilly considering that I‚Äôve no exhaust, I believe it could be a PSU or a motherboard/BIOS issue, could anyone help me before I start swapping out parts?

These ram sticks have been tested in another system and I know they work. After doing some research, it seems that linux is okay with some memory issues and will silently fail, while windows is not okay with that so that's why linux can boot but windows can't. \n\nI'm going to test each slot of ram tomorrow, and see if they fail on memtest86+ too. I can try swapping out the cpu and ssd too because they are untested but it's most likely the motherboard.\n\nDoes anyone know the common issues for a motherboard causing ram issues? Is there anything I might want to look for that maybe I can fix? I was thinking it could be the traces or there's something wrong with the cpu socket.

    "selftext": "I just got a WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR (0x124) out of nowhere. This is the first time it‚Äôs ever happened. I wasn‚Äôt doing anything heavy just playing a light game when my PC suddenly froze and crashed, no blue screen just crashed, and when I restarted my pc, it just says its fixing my pc and diagnosing it\n\nI don‚Äôt use my PC very often, so this really surprised me. I suspect it might be related to my RAM, since my memory tends to fail or start acting up after about 5-6 months of use. So i constantly have to buy a new RAM. Not sure if it‚Äôs because my PC is pretty old or if it‚Äôs something to do with the RAM manufacturer.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this kind of issue? Could it be something else, like the CPU, motherboard, or maybe even power supply? Any advice on how to troubleshoot or confirm what‚Äôs causing it would be really appreciated.",

When I connect ethernet the router acknowledges that it is there, and when I connect a display port cable, the monitor acknowledges a connection by coming out of standby but does not receive a signal. \n\nI have also tried all the basic troubleshooting steps including using one ram stick, reseating GPU, trying a different display and display cable and changing to DP 1.2, also disconnected all the drives just in case.\n\nPrior to changing the settings the computer was fine, was purchased second hand from tech recyclers, they could have changed some bios settings which will be reset?\n\nAny ideas on what I can do? looking into connecting to a DVI display or testing with a different GPU, others have had success by using a CPU with integrated graphics, however this is a server motherboard with no display out so no luck there.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm having a strange time with my PC as of the last few days.\n\nFirstly, I noticed that one of my SATA hard drives was completely missing. After doing various checks, including changing the cables, my machine was unable to detect it. I'd done some research and I found that other users with my hard drive, a Western Digital SA510, have encountered an issue that caused the drive to be permanently unrecognizable.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm still working through this issue, as there are a few reddit threads fiscussing potential fixes. However, I've subsequently noticed other strange issues that may or may not be related. For example, if my pc goes to sleep, I'm unable to wake it. The only way to start it up again is to turn off the pc. When this happens, I'll often get a startup message saying \"the (windows) update failed to install, undoing changes\". This isn't a 100% repro, but has occurred a handful of times. Additionally, I had a moment where my PC simply shut down on me. It gave me the standard \"Shutting down...\" Windows screen before turning off.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPart of me wonders if something's up with my power supply (I don't have the make and model at hand, but it's 5 years old at this point). I wonder if my hard drive failing is related to a PSU issue, or it was simply an unlucky coincidence. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to investigate?\n\nMy PC seems to be fine when I'm not hititng these issues, and all peroformance diagnostics- fan speed, temp, gpu and cpu speeds all seem fine.",

    "selftext": "I've been trying to troubleshoot this issue for most of this year.\n\nWhat I've noticed is that I get random blackouts on my primary monitor when a television set is connected through HDMI - even when a DisplayPort to HDMI converter is used.\n\nSomething appears to be tripping the hot-plug detection, even when a connected TV is off or in \"sleep\", as newer sets seem to always be.\n\nI have had this happen with:\n\n\\* two video cards (a 3080 and a 5070)  \n\\* two television sets (a 2013 Phillips HDTV and a 2024 Hisense QD7)  \n\\* multiple VESA-certified DP cables  \n\\* two LG monitors  \n\\* two different HDMI cables (one 1.4 and one 2.1)  \n\\* three breaker circuits in my apartment  \n\\* connected to a UPS and connected to a power strip\n\nI was able to reliably reproduce the issue when the HDTV was powered on a different breaker line than my UPS. I began to notice that if the HDMI connector brushed up against the PC chassis in just the right way, it would trigger the exact same temporary blank-out on my DisplayPort-connected monitor, even when the TV was off.\n\nNow that I've made the upgrade to a newer TV set, I have an older Logitech audio system plugged into its headphone jack. I've noticed that when the blackouts happen at random, there is an audible click from the audio system (it stays on), the same kind of noise you would hear from connecting or disconnecting the jack.\n\nI've checked all of the wiring, done multimeter tests; I've lived in this apartment for 20 years and have never had this issue until earlier this year when I moved the PC to a location barely 20 feet from where it was before.\n\nAnd even with the same components that I first began experiencing this with, I used them in the same setup in that previous location (3080, DisplayPort, LG monitor, HDTV) and never once had this happen.\n\nI changed rooms and it was happening regularly but infrequently enough that I'd forget. Now that I've upgraded the card, the cabling, the monitor and the TV, it happens several times a day.",

Yesterday I got a new microphone and I tested it in a call with a friend in a group chat, he said there was no echo, then later I got on a call with another friend in a server, asked him if he hears echo and he said he does, then I go back to the other friend and ask him if he hears it and now he also says he hears it.  \nI'm using headphones and an external microphone, so it can't be that the mic is picking up the sound.  \nAlso I'm not completely sure but this seems to only happen if there is another person from a laptop/PC in the call. For example if I'm in a call with a mobile user he doesn't hear echo, but if there's a laptop/PC user and a mobile user in the call, both of them hear echo.  \nI don't think it's from Discord itself because I tested it on messenger and there's also echo for a PC/laptop user.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, thank you for reading in advance! As the title suggests, I'm facing issues transferring data from my Google Pixel 8 to my new Samsung S25.\n\nFrom what I know, a google pixel doesn't backup any kind of data on the device itself, just in the google/gmail account. And all my gmail account storages have been maxed out for more than a year now. As a result, none of my pics, whatsapp chats, etc. have been backed up.\n\nNow when I ended up getting a S25, I didn't realize it could be an issue until I gave it some thought. Full disclosure, maybe it's obvious, but I know absolutely nothing about technology. So I held off on transferring everything myself and I took both the phones to the local electronics store who transferred the data from my Huawei Y7 Prime to the Pixel 8.\n\nThe person there confirmed my doubts and said that the tranfer will be extremely hard. It seemed like he could try something which would take a very long time and he isn't sure it'll work at all. According to him, the only way to resolve this issue in a foolproof way is to buy google storage, back everything up and then transfer it normally.\n\nI relayed all of this to my father and he thinks its not that serious of an issue and the store is trying to rip us off.\n\nSo, I turn to the people on this sub. Is there any way to transfer everything easily or is the person from the store right, and I have to buy more google storage? Any input will be helpful, thanks again!\n\nEDIT: If this is not the subreddit to post a question like this, I apologize! I'd be grateful if someone could point out the appropriate subreddit.",

I've been gaming with no issues in the past, but since the last month or so, my games run butter smooth for the first 5-10 mins, and then start lagging like crazy after a while.\n\n  \nMy GPU is Nvidia RTX 4060 and my graphics driver is updated to the latest nvidia driver 581.57\n\n  \nHere are images of my graphics stats using msi afterburner/rivatuner while playing GTA V, for example.\n\n  \nFirst 5-10 mins: [https://imgur.com/a/CZXM8PN](https://imgur.com/a/CZXM8PN)\n\nAfterwards: [https://imgur.com/a/Tf8Eftg](https://imgur.com/a/Tf8Eftg)\n\n\n\nPersonally, I suspect it's a graphics driver issue. But it also could be overheating. Would love to here your thoughts, thank you.",

The mouse itself will work and move the cursor but the 2 click buttons don't work until I stop typing. This is a problem in games where I'm using the keyboard for movement and mouse clicks for shooting. It will not shoot unless I stop pressing the keyboard.\n\nI trying to type in a word document while trying to click things and it is the same. It will not activate the clock buttons if something from the keyboard is press. \n\nAny ideas?",

    "selftext": "Howdy people, I‚Äôve been having some weird stability issues with my PC and could use advice. My machine randomly shuts off without warning, sometimes at idle (the desktop and even the BIOS screen) and sometimes in games, including low demand ones like Roblox and R6 at all low graphics and high demand ones like Sekiro . There‚Äôs no warning, no BSOD, nothing critical in Event Viewer that points to kernel power 41. Now the pc shutting off at idle was after I updated to the most recent BIOS, mine was 2 years old and it had way less stability issues. The pc seems noticeably slower too and I‚Äôm starting to think that the BIOS update unveiled some hardware issue as all the UEFI settings are default too.\n\nMy specs are as follows:\n\nAsRock a620 AM5\nAMD Radeon rx 7800xt sapphire GDDR6\nAMD Ryzen 7800x3D 8-core\nRam: 32GB (2x16) T-Force 6000\nSsd: Kingstone kioxia-exceria 1T\nCooler mars gaming liquid 120mm\nseasonic 750W +gold\nMSI case\n120mm liquid cooler for the CPU \nCase has no rear exhaust only frontal intake\n\nMy notes:\nThe stability issues pre-BIOS update didn‚Äôt seem to subside by slightly undervolting GPU\n\nXMP profile is off\n\nMy temps never exceed 80¬∞C \n\nEvent viewer and reliability monitor show nothing conclusive\n\nThe seller barely had it for a year and didn‚Äôt use it often or for long periods of time\n\nSince my temps are relatively chilly considering that I‚Äôve no exhaust, I believe it could be a PSU or a motherboard/BIOS issue, could anyone help me before I start swapping out parts?

    "selftext": "Recently I was having Wi-Fi problems with my laptop. It would not connect wirelessly at all I could only connect through Ethernet. My built-in Wi-Fi was not showing up in Device Manager though Bluetooth and Ethernet were there. I clicked the Wi-Fi button in the bottom right and checked airplane mode and Bluetooth settings but nothing worked. I even tried resetting the whole computer but it did not change anything.\n\nThen I bought a TP-Link USB Wi-Fi adapter. I plugged it in and installed its software and finally got Internet. While installing I checked Device Manager and saw Realtek RTL8852BE Wi-Fi 6 802.11ax PCIe Adapter #2 appear.\n\nHere is the weird part after unplugging the adapter and deleting its software my laptop still has Internet. Device Manager still shows the TP-Link name but I am not using the adapter anymore.\n\nIs this normal and is it a short-term problem or is it fixed permanently? Has anyone else experienced this",
