    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I‚Äôd like to share the app I‚Äôve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI‚Äôve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn‚Äôt an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn‚Äôt have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies.¬†\n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I‚Äôm also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I‚Äôm actively looking for ideas to improve it.¬†\n\nThank you!¬†",

    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

I‚Äôd like to share the app I‚Äôve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI‚Äôve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working.

I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn‚Äôt an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn‚Äôt have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies.¬†\n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I‚Äôm also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts!

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "title": "Added height ruler to my iOS photogrammetry app",
    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "title": "iMessage Activation Issue",
    "selftext": "Scroll to bottom for the fix that worked for me!\n\nHey folks, just wanting to make this post in case anyone else goes through the same issues both my partner and myself were dealing with. We wasted way too much time on the phone with both our carrier (Verizon) and Apple support with no real solution from them, and also trying all sorts of different fixes mentioned online. \n\nNot sure if this is an issue specifically with certain carriers, or the new iPhones/new IOS version. In my case specifically, we were porting our lines from T-Mobile over to Verizon, along with activating two new iPhone 17s. After going through the process, we both noticed our iMessage and FaceTime were not working. Verizon did tell us it might take anywhere from 30 minutes, to an hour for it to start working properly, but it didn‚Äôt. Waited a couple hours, still nothing. To keep it brief, we called Verizon support and they had us do all sorts of things as it seemed like they might not have ever seen this issue before. \n\nThey had us restart the phone, turn iMessage and FaceTime on/off, reset network settings, turn off stolen device protection, remove phone number and primary email from Apple account, delete eSIM and try a new one, sign in and out of Apple account on phone, a whole bunch of different things. None of which worked. Incidentally, once the primary email was removed, Apple wasn‚Äôt allowing us to re-add the primary email so there‚Äôs another issue there. But that‚Äôs for a different time. \n\nAnyway, after trying every trick in the book, Verizon‚Äôs suggestion was to wait 24 hours, and reach out to Apple if iMessage still wasn‚Äôt working. Being impatient, and wanting our new phones to work out of the box, like literally every other phone I‚Äôve ever owned, we reached out to Apple. \n\nApples suggestion was to leave iMessage and FaceTime alone (don‚Äôt keep turning it on/off, and don‚Äôt reboot the phone as this restarts the verification timer/process every time) and wait 24 hours. Based on what I‚Äôve seen online, that may, or may not work for some people, so I wasn‚Äôt too happy with that response. Just cross my fingers and hope one of the primary features of my iPhone works in 24 hours. \n\nAfter going crazy trying to find a solution, I figured I‚Äôd just give it the time they suggested but even then it still wasn‚Äôt working. So once again, I was trying anything and everything to get it working. Now for the trick that worked for me! \n\nThere are similar variations of what I did mentioned online and in other Reddit posts, but none exactly like what I did. \n\n\nMy Fix: \n\n1. Go to settings -> Apps -> iMessage \n\n2. Turn off iMessage\n\n3. Turn on airplane mode, make sure you aren‚Äôt connected to WiFi \n\n4. Turn on iMessage\n\n5. Directly under the on/off switch you should see ‚ÄúSend & Receive‚Äù. Go into that. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll see your phone number and email address you can use with iMessage. If your number isn‚Äôt working like me, there should be no blue check mark next to your number. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to get, that blue check mark. \n\n6. While still in the ‚ÄúSend & Receive‚Äù tab, turn off airplane mode. Once my phone started connecting to my carrier, a circular loading icon appeared next to my phone number. This is what actually allowed the verification to go through, and get that check next to my phone number. Yay iMessage and FaceTime working as they should! \n\n\nAll the other variations of this I tried, resulted in the phone telling me there was an issue with the activation without even trying to do anything. Just an immediate error message. Doing it the way I did, actually seemed to allow the process to do what it needed to do without erroring out instantly. Hope this helps anyone out there with these same issues! \n",

Additionally you have the freedom at anytime to switch carriers with no phone buyout since the phone isn‚Äôt locked to any carrier.\n\nTrade-in would lower your total cost on either option. Apple will take your trade in and apply it toward the new phone, lowering your installments. AT&T will take your trade in and give you bill credits toward your monthly bill, meaning your have to keep the line with AT&T the full 3 years to get full value from your trade in.",

I pay for iCloud+ 2TB, and ever since upgrading from an iPhone 14 Pro to the iPhone 15 Pro Max (x2 devices) and now the iPhone 16 Pro Max, my reception and service seem way worse.\n\nA few things I‚Äôve noticed:\n\t‚Ä¢\tReception: I‚Äôm on Telstra, which should be reliable, but I‚Äôm often stuck with just 1 bar in areas that used to be fine.\n\t‚Ä¢\tSIM tray changes: The tray now only takes one SIM card with the metal facing the screen. Not sure if this is messing with signal?\n\t‚Ä¢\teSIM behavior: The eSIM seems to auto-activate, even though I don‚Äôt normally use it. My phone also seems to convert my national number to an international format, so when I call people, they don‚Äôt recognize the number.\n\t‚Ä¢\tData/account issues: Since Apple moved from Apple ID to Apple Account, I feel like I‚Äôve lost a lot of data. Could this be a bug in iOS (26.0.1) or even malware?\n\nHas anyone else noticed these weird changes with the newer iPhones in Australia? Is this expected, or am I dealing with some kind of misconfiguration?\n\nAppreciate any insights or advice ‚Äî I‚Äôm honestly considering alternatives at this point.\n",

Theres a bunch of phone repair shops but I dont want to take my phone there due to risk of bad parts etc. There are a few apple certified repair service centers though so I thought they would be trustworthy and hassle free. I called them and told them my issue. They quoted me a price which seemed right for what I needed to get done, but then they said, \"it is against apples policy to do \\_\\_ parts\" replacement, you pay the fee, we take your phone, and give u a new phone of the exact same model. this seemed a bit weird because I havent seen apple saying its against their policy to do mattery replacements anywhere(it rhymes with mattery the part im talking about). and they also said theres no guarantee or warranty or anything. not even a 90 day guarantee for the part. just a bit puzzled on what to do here. on one hand they are kinda my only option. on the other hand im wondering whether they just made up that \"apple doesnt do mattery replacements they replace the entire phone\" thing",

    "selftext": "Wanted to document my first anniversary of the apple ecosystem. Been a hard core user since the early Samsung galaxy days - S2, Note 4, S5, S7 edge, S10+, S22, S8 tab and all the accessories  (you get my point) \n\nFinally got pressured to change after the Mrs needed to airdrop me photos on honeymoon last Christmas.\n\nSummary - Really questioning why didn't I made the switch earlier but also a ton of things I've taken for granted in the Android world.\n\n\nPros \n1. FaceID - My God this alone should have been apple's branding. Every other device sucks at this and have consistently unreliable. The reliability has been my my authentication in all aspects with the phone from banking to emails to passwords and various logins so much more efficiently. Samsung fingerprints and facial recognition used to hang half the time or fail for me.\n\n2. Apple pay - need I say more. Various ecommerce partners and the reach vs Google/Samsung pay.\n\n3. Airpods instant connection - need I say more. Samsung buds failed me half the time and have a thousand diff apps and interfaces to get something done.\n\n4. Seamless interface with iPad /Apple 4K. Later purchases but they have proven to be a seamless experience. Especially with airdrop and mirroring.\n\n5. Photos just look so much better - ironically Samsung has better cameras but smth about a iphone photos taken makes them so easy and quality worthy to post \n\n6. Apps made for iPhone specifically interface wise - android apps used to be all over the place for me and cameras on apps just weren't as good as the native app which was frustrating.\n\n7. Shortcuts and automation - I know android ecosystem has this as well but ios just made it so much more accessible.\n\nCons\n1. File system - I feel dumb and handicapped by something as simple as a drag and drop. Why are photos on files not on my photos app and require a duplicate action to have it on my photos app. \n\n2. Photos can't be managed and sent as a folder. Photo folders or indexing are an absolutely nightmare. I can't airdrop a folder.\n\n3. Keyboard sucks ass - seriously android converts would know. I've usd SwiftKey but the touches are still bad.\n\n4. Notification - pull down screen is useless and I can't toggle notifications for app phone use unless I go into individual apps to manage each of them.\n\n5. Widgets are terrible and the lack of customisations is such a pain in the arse (I know this might be a developer issue)\n\n6. Every useful app that used to be free on android is now a pay only feature. \n\n7. Can I just know how much longer I need to charge my phone?\n\n8. Home screen customisation feels so handicapped (I know some might thing it's a feature)\n\nIn summary - faceid and airpods seamless connection would have been sufficient for me to make a change based off productively alone. But the lack of certain basic features I was used to in the Android space made it so frustrating at times.\n\nWould love to hear any tips and tricks to improve my experience especially from converts!\n\nMy daily driver is no an iphone 16p and iPad mini for the occasional functional needs. Media still mostly via the Samsung tablet for me.\n",

    "title": "Constant Hardware Issues with iPhone 16 Pro Max",
    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI wouldn't usually post online but given Apple's reputation for good service and high quality control I feel the need to bring some awareness. I switched from Samsung to iPhone 16 Pro Max at the iPhone 16 launch date, I was a pre-order and received mine on the day one batch. Since then its been a complete nightmare.\n\n**Issue 1:** Within 2 months of receiving the brand new phone, **my screen was flickering and lagging**, a common issue observed online as well with the first batch of phones. I reached out to apple support multiple times and they refused to replace the unit so I had to get it repaired. After the repair, as I was walking out of the apple store it started flickering again (\\***with a new screen by the way**) and they again refused to replace it and required me to make another appointment. I went back, they replaced the screen a second time, it again had the same issue. Had to make another appointment and argue with the manager for half an hour before they finally agreed to replace the unit.\n\n**Issue 2:** After another 4 months, **my camera showed a black screen and stopped working.** They ended up replacing the entire camera module. When I purchased the phone in the US, I asked specifically whether I could get it serviced anywhere in the world to which they said yes. At the time of the second issue I was located in Taiwan and they had to ship it to Singapore for the repair, I was loaned an iPhone 10 for 2 weeks while this Occurred.\n\n**Issue 3 (Present)**: As of last week my **0.5x camera started showing fog inside the lens despite no visible damage and never having been submerged in water**. I took it to the apple store and left it for 3 hours for repair. When I came back I was told that they refused to do the repair since there is water inside the phone. Apparently I can't even pay out of pocket to fix my lens, they instead asked me if I wanted to buy a new 16 pro max for roughly 2/3 the cost of a new 17 pro max. **They advertise water resistance but it is NOT water resistant and if any water happens to get in your warranty will not apply, and you also cannot fix it outside of warranty even if you offer money.** You can check this policy on Apple's website, apparently this is an actual thing. \n\nI am utterly shocked at how many issues this phone has had. Having used an iPhone back at the iPhone 8 generation and used a Samsung ever since, I am somebody who babies my tech, not a single scratch on any device I own, yet the 16 Pro Max over two different units has been constantly broken and Apple's attitude about it has been horrible. Now a device I purchased for over $1200 USD one year ago is broken and they won't even fix it since water got inside somehow, which is also ridiculous because they advertise IP68 water resistance and apparently even humidity or light rain can result in the phone being unservicable. My trade in value is also destroyed now too since they will not accept a water damaged phone. Does anyone have a suggestion at how I can proceed? I want to just replace the camera glass and keep using it so I don't have to buy a new phone or sustain further damage since the phone's electronics appear to work fine. Next phone will likely not be apple either way but I don't feel like putting down another $1000+ USD to purchase a new phone when I just got this one last year.\n\n**TL DR:** iPhone 16 Pro max has broken 3 times, Apple refuses to let me repair it and want advice how to salvage the situation. Also just FYI to potential buyers that Apple QC and support are both not up to prior standard and way behind industry standard.",

I noticed that my phone would get hot very easily even when we are in the shade and I'm not doing any demanding tasks. The screen would dim automatically shortly after using the phone outdoors to take photos which made it difficult to check the photos / frame the shots. It was really annoying specially when trying to take photos of kids running around. Charging would stop and I get the prompt that the phone will resume charging after it cools down (indoor!!). I don't recall having such issues with the 15 Pro Max. My question to those using the iPhone 17 Pro Max, did you experience similar issues? Does the vapor chamber cooling really work? ",

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to the iPhone 17 Pro because the difference in photo and video quality looks massive.\n\nBefore I take that step, I wanted to ask, is there anything I can do to noticeably improve the quality of my photos and videos on the 13 Pro?

    "selftext": "In our house, my two step daughters have iphones, as do I, and their father (my fiance) has an andriod. There have been two times in the last 6 months that the younger daughter has had a lot of my pictures on her photos app somehow. These are very random pictures she has, pictures of me traveling, pictures with friends on random days, screenshots of random things that I still had on my phone for some reason. I know for a fact that I have never shared these pictures with her. \n\nI would consider myself a little tech savvy and I couldn't figure out why she would have these photos (yes, I ruled out that she would have taken my phone and sent them to herself because I never leave my phone unattended). I was picking at her ipad and my phone for over an hour and nothing made sense. I eventually gave up and just erased all of my pictures on her ipad and called it good. \n\nTonight, she approached me and told me that she had a bunch of my pictures again. She was upset because of a picture of her dad and I kissing so it was a whole thing. But here we are again - how the heck does she have access to some of my pictures - and again, very random pictures!?\n\nCan anyone please tell me how to fix this? These are my photos and I don't have anything bad on my phone but I want my privacy. She has a tendency to tell her mom everything and their mom is super high-conflict, always starting drama and lies, and the least I want is for her to have access to my photos, which would mean her mom would have access to them. \n\nPlease tell me the most basic to the most complex ways that might possible fix this; any advice whether you think it applies or not, I will try anything. \n\nI do not remember ever signing into her ipad with my account, Both times I had airdrop on only for contacts (I do text her to her icloud account so she is one of my contacts) but I have turned that off completely for now until this gets fixed. I do not have Shared Albums on or Shared Library. I also need to add that the older one also has an iphone but this has never happened with her, just the younger one.\n\nThank you",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n‚Äã\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

I‚Äôve seen folks still using the iPhone X or even older ones that work perfectly fine while others can‚Äôt resist upgrading every single year.\nHonestly, I feel like iPhones can easily last 4 to 6 years if you take good care of them. The hardware holds up and Apple keeps pushing updates for quite a while. But it also makes me think should Apple stop selling older Pro models sooner or is it better that they keep them around for people who don‚Äôt want to spend a fortune on the latest one?\n\nSo, how old is your iPhone, and how is it holding up these days?",

One of my group chats shows that I added my email address to the group chat and then deleted my phone number (which I did not actually do myself). In the Settings of the Messages app, I have this: Spinny death wheel in front of my phone number, and a blue check in front of my email. When I tap my phone number, it asks me if I want to remove it. What is happening? What do I do? I did not change anything with my account. My phone bill is paid in full. My phone did not update last night. There is an update available, which I will try now. Would love your thoughts. ",

    "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm super confused and frustrated with what‚Äôs happening with Apple in Australia. I pay for iCloud+ 2TB, and ever since upgrading from an iPhone 14 Pro to the iPhone 15 Pro Max (x2 devices) and now the iPhone 16 Pro Max, my reception and service seem way worse.\n\nA few things I‚Äôve noticed:\n\t‚Ä¢\tReception: I‚Äôm on Telstra, which should be reliable, but I‚Äôm often stuck with just 1 bar in areas that used to be fine.\n\t‚Ä¢\tSIM tray changes: The tray now only takes one SIM card with the metal facing the screen. Not sure if this is messing with signal?\n\t‚Ä¢\teSIM behavior: The eSIM seems to auto-activate, even though I don‚Äôt normally use it. My phone also seems to convert my national number to an international format, so when I call people, they don‚Äôt recognize the number.\n\t‚Ä¢\tData/account issues: Since Apple moved from Apple ID to Apple Account, I feel like I‚Äôve lost a lot of data. Could this be a bug in iOS (26.0.1) or even malware?\n\nHas anyone else noticed these weird changes with the newer iPhones in Australia? Is this expected, or am I dealing with some kind of misconfiguration?\n\nAppreciate any insights or advice ‚Äî I‚Äôm honestly considering alternatives at this point.\n",

    "title": "iMessage Activation Issue",
    "selftext": "Scroll to bottom for the fix that worked for me!\n\nHey folks, just wanting to make this post in case anyone else goes through the same issues both my partner and myself were dealing with. We wasted way too much time on the phone with both our carrier (Verizon) and Apple support with no real solution from them, and also trying all sorts of different fixes mentioned online. \n\nNot sure if this is an issue specifically with certain carriers, or the new iPhones/new IOS version. In my case specifically, we were porting our lines from T-Mobile over to Verizon, along with activating two new iPhone 17s. After going through the process, we both noticed our iMessage and FaceTime were not working. Verizon did tell us it might take anywhere from 30 minutes, to an hour for it to start working properly, but it didn‚Äôt. Waited a couple hours, still nothing. To keep it brief, we called Verizon support and they had us do all sorts of things as it seemed like they might not have ever seen this issue before. \n\nThey had us restart the phone, turn iMessage and FaceTime on/off, reset network settings, turn off stolen device protection, remove phone number and primary email from Apple account, delete eSIM and try a new one, sign in and out of Apple account on phone, a whole bunch of different things. None of which worked. Incidentally, once the primary email was removed, Apple wasn‚Äôt allowing us to re-add the primary email so there‚Äôs another issue there. But that‚Äôs for a different time. \n\nAnyway, after trying every trick in the book, Verizon‚Äôs suggestion was to wait 24 hours, and reach out to Apple if iMessage still wasn‚Äôt working. Being impatient, and wanting our new phones to work out of the box, like literally every other phone I‚Äôve ever owned, we reached out to Apple. \n\nApples suggestion was to leave iMessage and FaceTime alone (don‚Äôt keep turning it on/off, and don‚Äôt reboot the phone as this restarts the verification timer/process every time) and wait 24 hours. Based on what I‚Äôve seen online, that may, or may not work for some people, so I wasn‚Äôt too happy with that response. Just cross my fingers and hope one of the primary features of my iPhone works in 24 hours. \n\nAfter going crazy trying to find a solution, I figured I‚Äôd just give it the time they suggested but even then it still wasn‚Äôt working. So once again, I was trying anything and everything to get it working. Now for the trick that worked for me! \n\nThere are similar variations of what I did mentioned online and in other Reddit posts, but none exactly like what I did. \n\n\nMy Fix: \n\n1. Go to settings -> Apps -> iMessage \n\n2. Turn off iMessage\n\n3. Turn on airplane mode, make sure you aren‚Äôt connected to WiFi \n\n4. Turn on iMessage\n\n5. Directly under the on/off switch you should see ‚ÄúSend & Receive‚Äù. Go into that. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll see your phone number and email address you can use with iMessage. If your number isn‚Äôt working like me, there should be no blue check mark next to your number. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to get, that blue check mark. \n\n6. While still in the ‚ÄúSend & Receive‚Äù tab, turn off airplane mode. Once my phone started connecting to my carrier, a circular loading icon appeared next to my phone number. This is what actually allowed the verification to go through, and get that check next to my phone number. Yay iMessage and FaceTime working as they should! \n\n\nAll the other variations of this I tried, resulted in the phone telling me there was an issue with the activation without even trying to do anything. Just an immediate error message. Doing it the way I did, actually seemed to allow the process to do what it needed to do without erroring out instantly. Hope this helps anyone out there with these same issues! \n",

Based on everything I read online, if I kept it marked as stolen and in my account then they wouldn't be able to do anything with the phone and it would be useless to them, and they wouldn't be able to access any info from the phone.\n\nYesterday I received this text, which oddly enough I never received to my phone, I can only see it on iMessages on my Macbook. They must have been able to find my number somehow though. I am worried about them accessing my photos, bank info, etc. What is the best way to proceed without them getting access to my personal info, if they even can?\n\n",

I called them and told them my issue. They quoted me a price which seemed right for what I needed to get done, but then they said, \"it is against apples policy to do \\_\\_ parts\" replacement, you pay the fee, we take your phone, and give u a new phone of the exact same model. this seemed a bit weird because I havent seen apple saying its against their policy to do mattery replacements anywhere(it rhymes with mattery the part im talking about). and they also said theres no guarantee or warranty or anything. not even a 90 day guarantee for the part. just a bit puzzled on what to do here. on one hand they are kinda my only option. on the other hand im wondering whether they just made up that \"apple doesnt do mattery replacements they replace the entire phone\" thing",

Additionally you have the freedom at anytime to switch carriers with no phone buyout since the phone isn‚Äôt locked to any carrier.\n\nTrade-in would lower your total cost on either option. Apple will take your trade in and apply it toward the new phone, lowering your installments. AT&T will take your trade in and give you bill credits toward your monthly bill, meaning your have to keep the line with AT&T the full 3 years to get full value from your trade in.",

I pay for iCloud+ 2TB, and ever since upgrading from an iPhone 14 Pro to the iPhone 15 Pro Max (x2 devices) and now the iPhone 16 Pro Max, my reception and service seem way worse.\n\nA few things I‚Äôve noticed:\n\t‚Ä¢\tReception: I‚Äôm on Telstra, which should be reliable, but I‚Äôm often stuck with just 1 bar in areas that used to be fine.\n\t‚Ä¢\tSIM tray changes: The tray now only takes one SIM card with the metal facing the screen. Not sure if this is messing with signal?\n\t‚Ä¢\teSIM behavior: The eSIM seems to auto-activate, even though I don‚Äôt normally use it. My phone also seems to convert my national number to an international format, so when I call people, they don‚Äôt recognize the number.\n\t‚Ä¢\tData/account issues: Since Apple moved from Apple ID to Apple Account, I feel like I‚Äôve lost a lot of data. Could this be a bug in iOS (26.0.1) or even malware?\n\nHas anyone else noticed these weird changes with the newer iPhones in Australia? Is this expected, or am I dealing with some kind of misconfiguration?\n\nAppreciate any insights or advice ‚Äî I‚Äôm honestly considering alternatives at this point.\n",

    "title": "iMessage Activation Issue",
    "selftext": "Scroll to bottom for the fix that worked for me!\n\nHey folks, just wanting to make this post in case anyone else goes through the same issues both my partner and myself were dealing with. We wasted way too much time on the phone with both our carrier (Verizon) and Apple support with no real solution from them, and also trying all sorts of different fixes mentioned online. \n\nNot sure if this is an issue specifically with certain carriers, or the new iPhones/new IOS version. In my case specifically, we were porting our lines from T-Mobile over to Verizon, along with activating two new iPhone 17s. After going through the process, we both noticed our iMessage and FaceTime were not working. Verizon did tell us it might take anywhere from 30 minutes, to an hour for it to start working properly, but it didn‚Äôt. Waited a couple hours, still nothing. To keep it brief, we called Verizon support and they had us do all sorts of things as it seemed like they might not have ever seen this issue before. \n\nThey had us restart the phone, turn iMessage and FaceTime on/off, reset network settings, turn off stolen device protection, remove phone number and primary email from Apple account, delete eSIM and try a new one, sign in and out of Apple account on phone, a whole bunch of different things. None of which worked. Incidentally, once the primary email was removed, Apple wasn‚Äôt allowing us to re-add the primary email so there‚Äôs another issue there. But that‚Äôs for a different time. \n\nAnyway, after trying every trick in the book, Verizon‚Äôs suggestion was to wait 24 hours, and reach out to Apple if iMessage still wasn‚Äôt working. Being impatient, and wanting our new phones to work out of the box, like literally every other phone I‚Äôve ever owned, we reached out to Apple. \n\nApples suggestion was to leave iMessage and FaceTime alone (don‚Äôt keep turning it on/off, and don‚Äôt reboot the phone as this restarts the verification timer/process every time) and wait 24 hours. Based on what I‚Äôve seen online, that may, or may not work for some people, so I wasn‚Äôt too happy with that response. Just cross my fingers and hope one of the primary features of my iPhone works in 24 hours. \n\nAfter going crazy trying to find a solution, I figured I‚Äôd just give it the time they suggested but even then it still wasn‚Äôt working. So once again, I was trying anything and everything to get it working. Now for the trick that worked for me! \n\nThere are similar variations of what I did mentioned online and in other Reddit posts, but none exactly like what I did. \n\n\nMy Fix: \n\n1. Go to settings -> Apps -> iMessage \n\n2. Turn off iMessage\n\n3. Turn on airplane mode, make sure you aren‚Äôt connected to WiFi \n\n4. Turn on iMessage\n\n5. Directly under the on/off switch you should see ‚ÄúSend & Receive‚Äù. Go into that. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll see your phone number and email address you can use with iMessage. If your number isn‚Äôt working like me, there should be no blue check mark next to your number. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to get, that blue check mark. \n\n6. While still in the ‚ÄúSend & Receive‚Äù tab, turn off airplane mode. Once my phone started connecting to my carrier, a circular loading icon appeared next to my phone number. This is what actually allowed the verification to go through, and get that check next to my phone number. Yay iMessage and FaceTime working as they should! \n\n\nAll the other variations of this I tried, resulted in the phone telling me there was an issue with the activation without even trying to do anything. Just an immediate error message. Doing it the way I did, actually seemed to allow the process to do what it needed to do without erroring out instantly. Hope this helps anyone out there with these same issues! \n",

For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt‚Äôs still in early access and I‚Äôd love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper)¬†\n\nThis is just the beginning - I‚Äôm actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you‚Äôre into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I‚Äôd really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

The authorized service centre‚Äôs report clearly mentioned ‚ÄúDisplay ‚Äì step mark on display.‚Äù\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called ‚Äúflagship quality‚Äù completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care ‚Äî never dropped, always in Samsung‚Äôs original case and protector ‚Äî yet the display failed twice. It‚Äôs shocking how a premium device costing nearly ‚Çπ1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite ‚Äî big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you‚Äôre left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand‚Äôs promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point üòÖ, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol üòÖ)",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course). I would LOVE if google would implement Android XR in Android. I dont mind my phone getting hot but I wouldn't have to sync my photos and all of that.",

I created an app that helps you to keep track of all your data in one simple place.\n\n# Download\n\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franko.privacyguard)\n\nI first released it 4 years ago, but Google removed it stating it violates the terms of use. Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

I‚Äôve been working on something I‚Äôm really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It‚Äôs a great feature, but it‚Äôs locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built¬†**MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to¬†**any Android phone running Android 9 or above**¬†‚Äî including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt‚Äôs still in early access and I‚Äôd love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper)¬†\n\nThis is just the beginning - I‚Äôm actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you‚Äôre into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I‚Äôd really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre‚Äôs report clearly mentioned ‚ÄúDisplay ‚Äì step mark on display.‚Äù\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called ‚Äúflagship quality‚Äù completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care ‚Äî never dropped, always in Samsung‚Äôs original case and protector ‚Äî yet the display failed twice. It‚Äôs shocking how a premium device costing nearly ‚Çπ1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite ‚Äî big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you‚Äôre left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand‚Äôs promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "selftext": "It's too much of a coincidence that ONEPLUS has not only downgraded the camera specs but also ditched Hassleblad partnership while OPPO is going all out with strong focus on camera and overall specs/features with the Find X9 series. Oneplus could have just as easily kept the same camera hardware in OP15 as OP13 which would have been good enough for 2026 with proper tuning but they didn't.\n\nAlso, from the display specs the focus is mostly on performance and high refresh rates now.\n\nOneplus flagships are known for VFM with balanced specs but from now on I think the focus is shifting towards to performance/gaming so basically it's minus -1 point from the camera department and +1 point in the performance department.\n\nI strongly believe, from now on ONEPLUS is likely to become a gaming orientated brand and OPPO will be the main balanced brand like IQOO and VIVO, POCO/REDMI and XIAOMI.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEdit: Appending the camera downgrade info below\n\nMain camera: LYT 808 ‚Üí LYT 700 (same as Nord5)\n\nTelephoto: OV64B ‚Üí JN5",

I‚Äôve been working on something I‚Äôm really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It‚Äôs a great feature, but it‚Äôs locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built¬†**MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to¬†**any Android phone running Android 9 or above**¬†‚Äî including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt‚Äôs still in early access and I‚Äôd love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper)¬†\n\nThis is just the beginning - I‚Äôm actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you‚Äôre into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I‚Äôd really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "Technical info: Pixel 8a, build BP3A.251005.004.B1 \n\nThis morning I was doing my normal morning routine of driving to work and listening to an audio book. About 20 minutes in, android auto disconnects. No biggie, I'm used to it disconnecting, not sure if it's a pixel, android auto, cable, or Ford thing. Either way, I noticed it wasn't due to a bad connection, the phone had rebooted? Weird, a couple minutes goes by and it happens again.\n\nThis time I keep my eyes on the phone to see what's going on, and it looked like Gemini was being pulled up. I then turn off microphone access cause I was thinking maybe my audio book was triggering some weird \"turn off\" microphone command. Well then my phone acts even stranger. Reboots again and this time whenever I press the sleep button, it opens up the camera and then proceeds to prompt me to unblock the microphone, then it pulls up Gemini again. This literally repeats 4 or 5 times before I get freaked out and put it in airplane mode as a precaution. I get to work and turn off airplane mode and it hasn't occured since. \n\nI don't think it's hacking but it really felt like my phone was not listening to my commands and someone else was taking over the screen and trying to run Gemini. Anyone else see this behavior before? ",

    "selftext": "Before someone comes here to explain me about the miracles/horrors of Gemini Nano, please hear me out first.\n\nGoogle been talking a lot about AI when you look around Pixel Phones, if you read anything on internet about the Tensor G3, G4, G5... etc, AI is one of their main topics, including at Google Website.\n\nHowever, in the real world scenario, Google provides zero content to use this feature. If you want to use AI, it is Gemini or CPU rendering.\n\nQualcomm in other hand, does not advertise it much but you can take any high-end Qualcomm chipset and run local AI models in 1/100 the time due NPU acceleration (QNN)\n\nI have a 2022 old Sony phone, and I can produce AI images in 5 seconds while my Pixel 9 Pro takes almost almost 2 minutes due CPU processing.\n\n\\--\n\nBefore someone comes to talk to me about the miracles/horrors of Google AI Gallery or LiteRT, I think this is still bare-bones. You can see at their github page, they promote Google Tensor as \"Coming soon\".\n\nEdge Torch - The tool doing LLM model conversion - refers itself as \"broad CPU coverage, with **initial** GPU and NPU support\". This project started a year ago.\n\nThis to me is surprising, again, considering Google broadly talking about AI into Pixel phones but having nothing (except own made solutions), and Qualcomm talking very little about own phone chipsets but supporting most of their high-end devices for a while.",

For the record, my phone was not overheating (battery temp was around 30C) and I hadn't really been using it for a couple hours leading up to the recording.\n\nKind of a bummer as I have been A/B'ing the Pixel with a Z Fold 7 and had switched back over specifically for photo point and shoot and because I enjoy using Pixel launcher on a daily basis.",

It is specifically designed to connect to the Charging Speaker Dock and uses a unique pin configuration and internal circuitry known only to the tablet and the official dock.\nGeneric Specification: The cable you are considering is a generic 7.62mm 4-pin adapter designed for a wide range of small, low-power devices like smart watches, children's bracelets, and specific trackers (as mentioned in the reviews). The fact that the pins may look like they align does not mean the electrical connections (the pinout) will match the tablet's requirements.\nRisk of Damage: Attempting to charge a device with a non-compatible connector, even if it physically aligns, can potentially lead to no charge, slow charge, or in a worst-case scenario, damage to the device's internal charging circuitry.\nFor charging your Google Pixel Tablet, you should rely on the standard USB-C port or the official Google Charging Speaker Dock.\nthe end, your question was: Could this connector be used to charge my Google pixel 11-in tablet from the rear? The pins look like they will work and align",

That‚Äôs when the nightmare started.\n\nThey told me O2 isn‚Äôt an authorized reseller, even though it‚Äôs literally listed on Google‚Äôs official site.\n\nO2 confirmed they have no access or ability to change anything in Google‚Äôs warranty system.\n\nWhen I went back to Google with that, they just repeated the same false info and closed the case.\n\nAt one point, Google support even offered to remotely check the phone‚Äôs internal system logs to verify that it hadn‚Äôt been used before I purchased it.

I used to have bedtime mode set up that it would then on when I plugged my phone in at night (which is when I was going to sleep) and then it would start in bedtime mode until a) my alarm went off or b) I unplugged my phone. This meant on weekends my phone would stay silent until I woke up and unplugged it myself.\nSince I updated my phone this week, bedtime mode will now turn itself off after the alarm time as that is when it says my \"night time\" ends, even if my phone is still plugged in and has not been touched. This means as soon as I get a notification on a weekend morning, I wake up and my precious lie in is ruined.\nAny one else having the same issue and any idea how to fix this? Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Google has been giving me the runaround from a promotion they promised to apply to my order for two months now, and just taking it to the Internet to vent, and shed some negative light on their customer service.\n\nBelow is a recent note I sent after my now (unsuccessful) battle with getting Google Customer Service to honor a discount code:\n\nHere's what has happened so far:\n\nOn August 20, 2025 I placed order GS.xxxxxxxxx (x'd out for privacy) for a Pixel 10 Pro and a Nest Thermostat. The Nest Thermostat had a discount applied since my existing Nest went obsolete\n\nOn August 21, 2025 I received a discount code for \"10% off a purchase.\" Rather than cancel my order which hadn't yet shipped, and replace the order with the discount code, I reached out to customer service to see if they could retroactively apply.\n\nCustomer service told me the following:\n\n11:49:06‚ÄØAM (me): Ok, so to be clear - once the entire order arrives (the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro), you want me to reach back out to the Google Support chat and share the coupon code, and then you'll apply the code to the order price after it's been delivered?\n11:50:15‚ÄØAM Robertson: Yes, exactly. that is correct. we are also informed by our support on that (my name), rather than cancelling the order and apply the code, its much more a hassle in our customers end as per our support team\n11:50:42‚ÄØAM Robertson: no worries once you contacted us back we can consult the case so the code will be applied\n11:52:02‚ÄØAM (me): Yeah it seems like a pain to cancel / re-order. And can you confirm that the 10% will be applied to both the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro? I did have some rebates / offers on these items that were applied (such as being a Google Fi customer), but wanted to make sure the 10% is still applicable on top of those discounts\n11:54:35‚ÄØAM Robertson: Oh yes, the 10% discount it will be applicable on top of those discounts (my name) no worries \n\n\nBecause of this, I didn't cancel and replace the order. \n\nHad I done so, I at least would have separated the order into two orders - and gotten the discount on the Nest for one order, and the discount on my phone (an extra $100 off) on the other.\n\nNow after TWO MONTHS of back and forth with customer service, I keep getting told that Google won't apply the discount like the original customer service agent guaranteed me they would. Google has effectively cheated me out of over $100.\n\nAll of their responses ignore the original interaction I had, including the most recent one:\n\nThank you for contacting the Google Support Team regarding your order. We sincerely apologize for the delay in our response and truly appreciate your patience during this review period.\n\nOur specialist team has thoroughly reviewed your request to apply an additional promotional code to your order. We regret to inform you that we cannot accommodate this request.\n\nWe understand this outcome is disappointing, and we want to sincerely apologize for any confusion or frustration this may have caused.\n\nOur higher support team confirmed that a prior promotion‚Äîthe Nest Learning Thermostat upgrade promotion‚Äîwas already utilized on the existing order where you wished to apply the new code. As per our terms of service, only one promotional code or discount can be applied per order. This policy prevents us from stacking multiple discounts onto a single purchase.\n\nWe recognize the frustration of not being able to use the additional discount, and we truly apologize for this policy constraint.\n\nIf you have any further questions, or if you need assistance exploring other ways to save on a future purchase, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nThanks!\nCed\nThe Google Support Team\n\n\nThere have been over 20 interactions back and forth, all of them ignore what the first agent told me. Anyone else go through this before?",

    "selftext": "Well, I have been searching for this specific issue all over the internet to see if this is a common issue or not, but I couldn't find anything anywhere, so I guess I was the only lucky guy to experience this.\nA week ago, I was at a Barber üíà shop with my friend, and I really like to take photos anywhere I go, so we did take some really good pictures for each other using my Pixel 10. I then realized that all the photos I take are in the processing state for too long(never end for first photo), but I didn't think too much, and we keep on taking photos regardless of the last photos being in the processing state. Long story short, after our excellent barber done his job, I took some mirror selfie and would like to post it on my Facebook, but the photos are (still) processing. I then looked at the file names by chance and saw \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxxxx.jpg\" for these photos, oh yeah, may be my photos are so good that tensor G5 needs more time, I wonder. \nBut I really want to upload that mirror selfie on my Facebook, I couldn't wait more. So I did the most dumbest decision, I restarted my phone, just that the processing would start again and fix. But guess what and to my surprise, after restarting the phone, all of these previous \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxx.jpg\" were gone in thin air, I couldn't find it on photos, cloud, not on the trash. I really didn't believe that Google might have that kind of problem, so I waited, I tried taking another photos and these seem to become normal with their processing time being normal (1-3 sec) back again. But yet, the photos at the barber shop never came back. This is just my experience sharing about that and still no hate for Pixel (had been a fan since Nexus), but I think they might include some mitigation for this kind of situation, for example, at least saving the Non- processed photos on device or some kind of fail safe feature. \nBut yeah, this was the only time I've experienced this, and so far it's still working as expected. I hope this doesn't come again. Evidence? No, I really didn't think that kind of thing would ever happen, so no screenshot nor nothing was recorded.\n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI had a Pixel 2 XL when I released and I recently upgraded to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. I love the device, the camera is beautiful and I haven't had any complaints or inquiries until now.\n\nI've noticed some games just will not load. Not even past the splash screen. I noticed it first with Chaos Zero Nightmare and then with Duet Night Abyss and it's preload. It's disappointing because I really use my phone for the small bit of gaming I do and for the camera, I thought I'd have the best of both worlds here.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue? If so, how did you fix it?\n\nThanks so much!\n\n*Edit*\n\nI confirmed that these games work on different devices, Motorola Edge 2021 and iPhone 15. ",

I'm in the UK and the same day warranty repair places are few and far between if you're not in a major city - I can't send my phone away from a few days as I use it to pay for things etc and I don't have a spare device. \n\nI've asked Google to RMA (device is within warranty) as I think the screen failing twice with no external impacts or damage suggests an issue with the device somewhere else. However Google support are stuck in a process loop where they insist that I provide a PDF copy of a repair order, which the company who did the repair cannot provide, as their system does not output PDFs. Additionally I'm being asked to go back to the company repeatedly for this info.\n\nCan anyone help me get this escalated to someone at Google with autonomy to get this resolved? Or does anyone have a contact or someone at Google who monitors reddit who could help?\n\nIn case anyone assumes I'm trying to pull a con on Google - I'd gain nothing here if they RMA as I would like. My device is fairly pristine so Google get that back to repair and then have a refurbed phone, I get a refurbished phone. No gain financially.",

    "selftext": "\\*\\* Yeah, I know it's a pretty dumb little opinion question, but I still place more value in human responses from internet strangers than I do from trying to glean anything at all from targeted articles, sponsored videos etc.\n\nI've got the 6a, and I planned on replacing the battery and just keeping it as long as possible, but I'm seeing plenty of reports here that even that doesn't mitigated the update, and even a brand new battery is going to have quite bad performance. Also, I don't have a 'google authorized' service center in my country. Honestly, this sure looks to me like they got a little too impatient to wait for the planned obsolescense to kick in, and the battery issue was just too easy of an opportunity to force a purchase from a ton of customers, so I'm out. Bye bye, damn shame as I liked your phones, but you are an awful, soulless company anyways, so I'm moving on.\n\nThat said, I'm not one who particularly trusts tech, but I (like all of use) haven't had much choice in going along with the integration of it in our lives, and given the amount of information our devices now carry and as they literally serve as primary sources of identity confirmation, I'm not happy to be pushed to have to switch devices sooner than I'd like. Transferring from the 5 to the 6 was fine; as I recall, a pretty seamless transfer. Going from a Pixel to a different manufacturer? I've not had any experience with that, so I'm hoping to avoid any sort of deluge of idiotic, innane problems like the ones I've seen reported in this sub (locked out of google account etc.).\n\nWhat would be the best manufacturer to graduate to with minimal conflict? I'm not tech-incapable, I simply do not trust the level of intrustion/dependence on it in our lives, and thus things like this make me nervous af. I'd prefer as seamless experience as possible, so any advice or suggestions are much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "This kinda like an advise post if you're on the fence about upgrading or just switching brands all together.\n\nI've been with Pixel since the 3XL, upgrading every 2 \nyears or so (8 Pro was my last one), having fun and all that. I got used to the issues in thermals, battery, and bad modems. I accepted it's flaws and moved on, the camera was great so no biggie right.\n\nThen the Pixel 10 impressions started coming in and it was honestly disheartening, I been looking forward to that phone since the early leaks. Overall not a big upgrade, all the same issues, and the GPU performance and drivers situation. Performance just trailing too behind other phones at it's price range. I know I know \"benchmarks aren't everything, optimization is king, you only need that power for gaming and blah blah\". Yeah until your phone has to brute force an unoptimized app (which is common on Android I fear) all Pixel owners I dare you open Best Buy or Amazon and immediately try to scroll, it WILL struggle. \n\nI decided to jump ship and got a One Plus 13, and let me tell you it was night and day. I got the 16 + 512 GB one for 800 (It was a sale + student discount). The performance jump was astronomical, this thing just flies through apps like it's nothing. Gaming of course is also no problem. The battery lasted 8+ hours on 5G (a miracle on pixel if you even get there). Thermal performance is excellent, no more hand warmer when just watching YouTube on wifi or just barely pushing it (Seriously how was that a thing). It truly felt like I had a flaship for real this time. \n\nIs it perfect? nah, Pixel UI is in general better, but not by much, if anything Oxygen OS let's you do things that were taken away, like status bar icons being able to be modified. Tho Pixel UI has one BIG FLAW, the status bar and gesture bar are disgustingly large and DON'T go transparent at all (Shit takes way too much screen real state like wtf). Oxygen OS lets you get rid of the gesture bar completely and it makes the phone feels much more immersive and its a godsend (been wanting this on pixel since the gesture bar was introduced). The camera is worse yes, but not too far behind either, I don't think too many pics so I was ok with this compromise. I don't care, and barely used, any of the AI features so it wasn't a big loss either.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the happiest I've been with a phone ever, don't be afraid to look outside of your pixel bubble if you feel like you're not getting what you paid for.

It makes the phone feel quite thick in the hand and in the pocket.\nDoes anyone have good recommendations for a truly thin case?\n\nMy main priorities are:\nVery slim profile (minimal bulk)\nGood for scratch protection\nDecent grip (not super slippery)\nPixel Snap\n\nI'm less concerned with heavy-duty drop protection and more focused on preserving the phone's original form factor. What are your top picks for slim cases?",

    "selftext": "I bought a brand new Google Pixel 9 Pro XL from O2 in Slovakia, which is officially listed on Google‚Äôs website as an authorized reseller since Google does not have any official physical store here in Europe. \nThe phone was sealed and never used, purchased in June 2025.\n\nWhen I checked the warranty on Google‚Äôs support page, it showed the phone as purchased in January ‚Äî five months before I actually bought it.\nThe warranty was already shortened to less than 24 months, even though EU law guarantees a full 24-month warranty for new products.\n\nAfter some digging, it seems Google started the warranty countdown from the day the phone arrived in O2‚Äôs stock, not from the day it was sold to me. That‚Äôs clearly wrong and against EU consumer law.\n\nSo I contacted Google support to get it corrected. That‚Äôs when the nightmare started.\n\nThey told me O2 isn‚Äôt an authorized reseller, even though it‚Äôs literally listed on Google‚Äôs official site.\n\nO2 confirmed they have no access or ability to change anything in Google‚Äôs warranty system.\n\nWhen I went back to Google with that, they just repeated the same false info and closed the case.\n\nAt one point, Google support even offered to remotely check the phone‚Äôs internal system logs to verify that it hadn‚Äôt been used before I purchased it. I agreed, and they confirmed exactly that ‚Äî the phone was first activated after my purchase date.\nAnd even after confirming it themselves, they still refused to fix the warranty.\n\nEvery agent I spoke to gave copy-pasted or contradictory replies. \nUnder both EU law and Google‚Äôs own warranty policy, Google is responsible for honoring the full 24-month warranty for products sold by authorized resellers. Passing the blame is not just lazy ‚Äî it‚Äôs unacceptable.\n\nThis whole experience has been absurd.\n\nTL;DR:\nBought a new Google phone from O2 (authorized reseller).\nGoogle‚Äôs system says it was bought 5 months earlier ‚Üí shortened warranty.\nGoogle checked the phone logs remotely and confirmed it hadn‚Äôt been used before purchase ‚Üí still refused to fix the warranty.\nSupport keeps giving false info and closing the case.\n\nHas anyone else in the EU had a wrong purchase date or shortened warranty on a new Google phone? Did you ever get Google to fix it?",

Either way, I noticed it wasn't due to a bad connection, the phone had rebooted? Weird, a couple minutes goes by and it happens again.\n\nThis time I keep my eyes on the phone to see what's going on, and it looked like Gemini was being pulled up. I then turn off microphone access cause I was thinking maybe my audio book was triggering some weird \"turn off\" microphone command. Well then my phone acts even stranger. Reboots again and this time whenever I press the sleep button, it opens up the camera and then proceeds to prompt me to unblock the microphone, then it pulls up Gemini again. This literally repeats 4 or 5 times before I get freaked out and put it in airplane mode as a precaution. I get to work and turn off airplane mode and it hasn't occured since. \n\nI don't think it's hacking but it really felt like my phone was not listening to my commands and someone else was taking over the screen and trying to run Gemini.

Is there a inbuilt call recorder, as i had one in samsung which automatically records without the beep or any voice notes.\n\n2. Any similar apps like samsung find in Pixel, to constantly have another phone get my location at all times and vice versa \n\n3. I'm using their close up moon wallpaper from living universe section, is it a live capture kind of thing from my current location, coz if it is.. its kind of awesome\n \nThanks in Advance ",

I have Google Home with camera notifications and cradlewise for baby notifications and all the notifications are delayed. Often I would unlock the phone and see a flurry of notifications from Google Home about camera activity popping up. Funny enough, these notifications are not time stamped to when the phone was unlocked, but when the event happened. So it is super common for a Google Home notification to pop up with 30 mins ago written on it. Same happens with other apps too. \n\nI have turned off the adaptive battery, have the Google Home and other apps allowed unrestricted access to battery, but nothing seems to work. I had a Pixel 8a and a Pixel 7 before this and never had the issue on them. \n\nNot sure if it is a faulty device or a software bug. ",

Yesterday in my car (wireless Android Auto) I took a call through the AA menu, and instead of playing sound through the car, it played it on my phone. My phone thought in the target selection of the phone app, that it was connected to the car. I had to end the call and call back for it to work properly. Today while I was in my car I joined a Teams call, and it did not play through the car, but again through the phone. Then after I've left my car, I put in my PIxel Buds Pro 2, but instead on switching to it, it switched to my Pixel Watch 2. I've removed my buds and put them back a couple of times, but it did not help, it always played through my watch. It did not happen with media playback yet, so it seems to be call related, but both the phone and Teams. Has anyone experience this?",

If you want to use AI, it is Gemini or CPU rendering.\n\nQualcomm in other hand, does not advertise it much but you can take any high-end Qualcomm chipset and run local AI models in 1/100 the time due NPU acceleration (QNN)\n\nI have a 2022 old Sony phone, and I can produce AI images in 5 seconds while my Pixel 9 Pro takes almost almost 2 minutes due CPU processing.\n\n\\--\n\nBefore someone comes to talk to me about the miracles/horrors of Google AI Gallery or LiteRT, I think this is still bare-bones. You can see at their github page, they promote Google Tensor as \"Coming soon\".\n\nEdge Torch - The tool doing LLM model conversion - refers itself as \"broad CPU coverage, with **initial** GPU and NPU support\". This project started a year ago.\n\nThis to me is surprising, again, considering Google broadly talking about AI into Pixel phones but having nothing (except own made solutions), and Qualcomm talking very little about own phone chipsets but supporting most of their high-end devices for a while.",

That‚Äôs when the nightmare started.\n\nThey told me O2 isn‚Äôt an authorized reseller, even though it‚Äôs literally listed on Google‚Äôs official site.\n\nO2 confirmed they have no access or ability to change anything in Google‚Äôs warranty system.\n\nWhen I went back to Google with that, they just repeated the same false info and closed the case.\n\nAt one point, Google support even offered to remotely check the phone‚Äôs internal system logs to verify that it hadn‚Äôt been used before I purchased it. I agreed, and they confirmed exactly that ‚Äî the phone was first activated after my purchase date.\nAnd even after confirming it themselves, they still refused to fix the warranty.\n\nEvery agent I spoke to gave copy-pasted or contradictory replies. \nUnder both EU law and Google‚Äôs own warranty policy, Google is responsible for honoring the full 24-month warranty for products sold by authorized resellers.

Reboots again and this time whenever I press the sleep button, it opens up the camera and then proceeds to prompt me to unblock the microphone, then it pulls up Gemini again. This literally repeats 4 or 5 times before I get freaked out and put it in airplane mode as a precaution. I get to work and turn off airplane mode and it hasn't occured since. \n\nI don't think it's hacking but it really felt like my phone was not listening to my commands and someone else was taking over the screen and trying to run Gemini.

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve used the S22 Ultra before and really liked the design and One UI, even though the battery life wasn‚Äôt the best. Now I‚Äôm looking at the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra and wanted to hear from people who‚Äôve spent time with them.\n\nOn paper they seem very close, but I‚Äôm curious about how they actually feel day to day. How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra‚Äôs S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who‚Äôs been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

But that was my fault to not have backup.\n\n\n\nAnyway, i gotten a cheap Xiaomi phone to use until i was back to my country since i acquired Samsung care+.\n\nOnce returned and submitted it to the Samsung costumer center they mentioned few times, it will be a free repair unless water damage is detected.\n\nOf course, i kept the phone relatively well, but it received its shares of water splashes, and knowing very well what waterproof mean in the phone world i was ready to pay the 93\\~USD of screen change out of warranty. (The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra? I guess i use it as a Dex PC. ",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I‚Äôm absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I‚Äôm there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this sound bar isn‚Äôt quite on the same level as my old system was, but it‚Äôs probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I‚Äôve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "Hello all, im just wondering if anyone has had this experience since the OneUI 8 update. Now, i will clarify a few things:\n\n1. I use the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024)\n2. I've had the update for about 2-3 months\n\nI recently started running again, I started taking it seriously back in June (pre-update). When I was running then, I would do as I still do today; start the 'Running' exercise on Samsung Health (on the watch) and crack on. The activity face would report my live pace and report the split every km - if I ran at a  6:00/km then the split readout wouldn't report a 6:00/km pace.\n\nHowever, since the last major update (OneUI 8) on the watch, the live pace has been way off. This is my current experience: I start the 'Running' activity I crack on and check the live pace its reading 6:30. When I hit the first split and the readout occurs, its reading ~30s faster such as 'lap pace, 5:57/km' - and this is the split that is recorded after I finish the activity. So what has happened to the live readings? It's been like this for months, at this point, i am just used to it and just use the incorrect live pace, knowing what it is roughly and just read the split readout for the correct information. Has anyone else experienced this, from OneUI 7 > OneUI 8? I don't know if this is Watch Ultra specific issue or across the product range.\n\nTLDR: Live running pace used to be relatively accurate, since One UI 8 update, the live pace is reported as a much slower pace than what the actual pace is.",

    "selftext": "I have been a long time smartwatch user and have tried a lot of brands. I have mostly settled on Samsung and Amazfit but each is missing something. This is short wish list of changes for Galaxy watches:\n\n  \n1) **let me swipe away individual notifications**. Right now, I have to clear all of them at once, or tap on each one and clear it. I would rather just swipe from the list to do some quick triaging;\n\n2) **improve the step count deduping** between watch and phone. Right now it really seems to overcount, so I just turn off step counting on my phone, which is a shame because it would be nice to track some steps while my watch is charging\n\n3) **add Energy Score to the Galaxy Fit 3.** that would make it a great companion to the Galaxy watch. I could wear it at night for seemless tracking. I also prefer it for some sports where I want a smaller, lighter device and I dont need GPS\n\n  \n4) **Make message replies via voice faster**. On Amazfit, I can tap the notification, then hold down a button to active the voice assistant and can directly dictate. On WearOS, it takes a lot of taps to do that (tap the notification, open on watch, reply, keyboard, swipe up to select different keyboards, tap the microphone icon)\n\n  \n5) **consider swiping up for notifications and using both left and right swipes to access tiles**. That lets me get at my 2 most important tiles with a single swipe.\n\n  \n5a) *bonus* \\- **consider a shortcut tile**. Amazfit does this well and has it as a list you can scroll through. Galaxy watches have this a bit with the new tile designs but it still caps at 4.\n\n\n\nThese are just my thoughts. Maybe it's just me :)",

The watch correctly paused the workout, but when we started moving again, I noticed later that it never resumed tracking. Result: I lost a big chunk of my ride data.\n\nToday, I went cycling again and took a short break. The watch paused as expected. When I started riding back home, I remembered the issue from yesterday and checked: it was still paused, even though I was already moving. I manually resumed it and finished the ride, but when I got home, I saw that it tracked the time of my return but didn‚Äôt record the route on the map. So the saved activity shows double the duration and only half the distance, ending exactly where it paused during my break.\n\nNot sure if a factory reset would fix this. For now, I‚Äôll try disabling auto-pause and rely on manual pausing/unpausing, hoping it doesn‚Äôt bug out again. Otherwise, I might have to ditch Samsung Health and just record directly on Strava.\n\nAnyone else running into this issue?",

I don‚Äôt wear it while sleeping because I find it uncomfortable. Some of my friends suggested that it might be caused by the watch ‚Äî possibly due to the radio frequency (RF) signals from Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or LTE, or because of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs any truth to this and if my new headaches could really be related to the watch.",

    "selftext": "Hello! I'm writing this as my last resort. Yesterday I got a Galaxy watch ultra 2025 for my birthday. Today I wanted to set it up and my blood is boiling right now. I cannot get it to connect to my cmf phone 2 pro. What I tried:\n\n\\- clear cache and all data on galaxy wear (I've had a Samsung fit3 before)\n\n\\- completly reinstall the galaxy wear app\n\n\\- I have galaxy watch 7 plugin installed (as the wear app requested it)\n\n\\- I restarted both my phone and the watch\n\n\\- I tried multiple times, with and without logging into a samsung acount, accepting automatic updated and declining them.\n\n\\- I removed the watch from my bluetooth paired devices list\n\nHere's the steps that lead me to the issue:\n\n\\- I turn on my watch\n\n\\- I open galaxy wear app\n\n\\- I add new device\n\n\\- I press on Galaxy watch ultra under detected devices list\n\n\\- I press \"pair\" after confirming the code from the screen on the android pairing popup\n\n\\- It sometimes asks me if I want to log into samsung, I skip this step for now (same was happening when I logged in)\n\n\\- I agree to terms of service and other stuff\n\n\\- The app throws me back to my homescreen and when I want to come back to it, it shows scanning for available devices in galaxy wear app. \n\nI would really appreciate any help with that issue. The official samsung support is currently unavailable since it's Sunday, but judging by how hard it was to find the phone number or live chat link and fight with AI assistant to conn3ect me with human I can only hope they will help. \n\nI can post the full video of the steps I take if my internet-taught english isn't that good. \n\nAlso if my post dosen't fit the subreddit, I would really appreciate if you could point me to a right page, and I will immidietly delete this post.

It's not like the watch is hung, but on the activity screen it will keep showing only which HR Zones you are on right now. Pressing the button would let you pause or resume activity but the HR screen just remains and won't let you see the other vital information. The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time. Later I found a work around, you need to open Samsung Health app on your phone then select the activity again which kinda resets the screen, but this is such a hassle to do mid ride when you can't even see the time. I used a Galaxy Watch 4 for a short time and it never had this problem, only on my new watch I'm experiencing this bug. \n\nAnyone else experienceing this issue?",

    "selftext": "Hello all, im just wondering if anyone has had this experience since the OneUI 8 update. Now, i will clarify a few things:\n\n1. I use the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024)\n2. I've had the update for about 2-3 months\n\nI recently started running again, I started taking it seriously back in June (pre-update). When I was running then, I would do as I still do today; start the 'Running' exercise on Samsung Health (on the watch) and crack on. The activity face would report my live pace and report the split every km - if I ran at a  6:00/km then the split readout wouldn't report a 6:00/km pace.\n\nHowever, since the last major update (OneUI 8) on the watch, the live pace has been way off. This is my current experience: I start the 'Running' activity I crack on and check the live pace its reading 6:30. When I hit the first split and the readout occurs, its reading ~30s faster such as 'lap pace, 5:57/km' - and this is the split that is recorded after I finish the activity. So what has happened to the live readings? It's been like this for months, at this point, i am just used to it and just use the incorrect live pace, knowing what it is roughly and just read the split readout for the correct information. Has anyone else experienced this, from OneUI 7 > OneUI 8? I don't know if this is Watch Ultra specific issue or across the product range.\n\nTLDR: Live running pace used to be relatively accurate, since One UI 8 update, the live pace is reported as a much slower pace than what the actual pace is.",

    "selftext": "I have been a long time smartwatch user and have tried a lot of brands. I have mostly settled on Samsung and Amazfit but each is missing something. This is short wish list of changes for Galaxy watches:\n\n  \n1) **let me swipe away individual notifications**. Right now, I have to clear all of them at once, or tap on each one and clear it. I would rather just swipe from the list to do some quick triaging;\n\n2) **improve the step count deduping** between watch and phone. Right now it really seems to overcount, so I just turn off step counting on my phone, which is a shame because it would be nice to track some steps while my watch is charging\n\n3) **add Energy Score to the Galaxy Fit 3.** that would make it a great companion to the Galaxy watch. I could wear it at night for seemless tracking. I also prefer it for some sports where I want a smaller, lighter device and I dont need GPS\n\n  \n4) **Make message replies via voice faster**. On Amazfit, I can tap the notification, then hold down a button to active the voice assistant and can directly dictate. On WearOS, it takes a lot of taps to do that (tap the notification, open on watch, reply, keyboard, swipe up to select different keyboards, tap the microphone icon)\n\n  \n5) **consider swiping up for notifications and using both left and right swipes to access tiles**. That lets me get at my 2 most important tiles with a single swipe.\n\n  \n5a) *bonus* \\- **consider a shortcut tile**. Amazfit does this well and has it as a list you can scroll through. Galaxy watches have this a bit with the new tile designs but it still caps at 4.\n\n\n\nThese are just my thoughts. Maybe it's just me :)",

    "selftext": "Ever since I updated my Watch7 to One UI 8, I‚Äôve had issues twice with the auto-pause feature during workouts (something that never happened before on the previous version).\n\nYesterday I went for a bike ride and stopped midway to chat with a friend. The watch correctly paused the workout, but when we started moving again, I noticed later that it never resumed tracking. Result: I lost a big chunk of my ride data.\n\nToday, I went cycling again and took a short break. The watch paused as expected. When I started riding back home, I remembered the issue from yesterday and checked: it was still paused, even though I was already moving. I manually resumed it and finished the ride, but when I got home, I saw that it tracked the time of my return but didn‚Äôt record the route on the map. So the saved activity shows double the duration and only half the distance, ending exactly where it paused during my break.\n\nNot sure if a factory reset would fix this. For now, I‚Äôll try disabling auto-pause and rely on manual pausing/unpausing, hoping it doesn‚Äôt bug out again. Otherwise, I might have to ditch Samsung Health and just record directly on Strava.\n\nAnyone else running into this issue?",

I cannot get it to connect to my cmf phone 2 pro.

The official samsung support is currently unavailable since it's Sunday, but judging by how hard it was to find the phone number or live chat link and fight with AI assistant to conn3ect me with human I can only hope they will help. \n\nI can post the full video of the steps I take if my internet-taught english isn't that good. \n\nAlso if my post dosen't fit the subreddit, I would really appreciate if you could point me to a right page, and I will immidietly delete this post.

It's not like the watch is hung, but on the activity screen it will keep showing only which HR Zones you are on right now. Pressing the button would let you pause or resume activity but the HR screen just remains and won't let you see the other vital information. The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time. Later I found a work around, you need to open Samsung Health app on your phone then select the activity again which kinda resets the screen, but this is such a hassle to do mid ride when you can't even see the time. I used a Galaxy Watch 4 for a short time and it never had this problem, only on my new watch I'm experiencing this bug. \n\nAnyone else experienceing this issue?",

    "selftext": "Hello all, im just wondering if anyone has had this experience since the OneUI 8 update. Now, i will clarify a few things:\n\n1. I use the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024)\n2. I've had the update for about 2-3 months\n\nI recently started running again, I started taking it seriously back in June (pre-update). When I was running then, I would do as I still do today; start the 'Running' exercise on Samsung Health (on the watch) and crack on. The activity face would report my live pace and report the split every km - if I ran at a  6:00/km then the split readout wouldn't report a 6:00/km pace.\n\nHowever, since the last major update (OneUI 8) on the watch, the live pace has been way off. This is my current experience: I start the 'Running' activity I crack on and check the live pace its reading 6:30. When I hit the first split and the readout occurs, its reading ~30s faster such as 'lap pace, 5:57/km' - and this is the split that is recorded after I finish the activity. So what has happened to the live readings? It's been like this for months, at this point, i am just used to it and just use the incorrect live pace, knowing what it is roughly and just read the split readout for the correct information. Has anyone else experienced this, from OneUI 7 > OneUI 8? I don't know if this is Watch Ultra specific issue or across the product range.\n\nTLDR: Live running pace used to be relatively accurate, since One UI 8 update, the live pace is reported as a much slower pace than what the actual pace is.",

    "selftext": "I have been a long time smartwatch user and have tried a lot of brands. I have mostly settled on Samsung and Amazfit but each is missing something. This is short wish list of changes for Galaxy watches:\n\n  \n1) **let me swipe away individual notifications**. Right now, I have to clear all of them at once, or tap on each one and clear it. I would rather just swipe from the list to do some quick triaging;\n\n2) **improve the step count deduping** between watch and phone. Right now it really seems to overcount, so I just turn off step counting on my phone, which is a shame because it would be nice to track some steps while my watch is charging\n\n3) **add Energy Score to the Galaxy Fit 3.** that would make it a great companion to the Galaxy watch. I could wear it at night for seemless tracking. I also prefer it for some sports where I want a smaller, lighter device and I dont need GPS\n\n  \n4) **Make message replies via voice faster**. On Amazfit, I can tap the notification, then hold down a button to active the voice assistant and can directly dictate. On WearOS, it takes a lot of taps to do that (tap the notification, open on watch, reply, keyboard, swipe up to select different keyboards, tap the microphone icon)\n\n  \n5) **consider swiping up for notifications and using both left and right swipes to access tiles**. That lets me get at my 2 most important tiles with a single swipe.\n\n  \n5a) *bonus* \\- **consider a shortcut tile**. Amazfit does this well and has it as a list you can scroll through. Galaxy watches have this a bit with the new tile designs but it still caps at 4.\n\n\n\nThese are just my thoughts. Maybe it's just me :)",

It‚Äôs a 240Hz screen just like the original and the build quality looks great.\n\nHowever, the colors look totally off. The contrast seems lower and everything looks kind of dull. What‚Äôs strange is that in MS Word, the colors look perfect and crisp, but in Windows Explorer, Premiere Pro, photos, and videos, they look washed out and not normal at all.\n\nSince the panel is identical, I‚Äôm wondering if this might be a software or color profile issue instead of a hardware one.\n\nAny ideas or guidance would be really appreciated.\n",

However, I actively use other Apple devices (iPhone 15, iPad 9). Here are my priorities:\n\n1- I'm a psychological counselor, and due to my profession, I frequently use office programs (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.).\n\n2- My job requires me to move my computer to multiple locations. Therefore, a good battery, quietness, and lightness are very important.\n\n3- I don't want to buy a laptop once, use it for many years, and then have to buy another one for work.\n\n4- The models I'm considering are the Macbook M2/M4 (the price between these two models is $300 in my country), the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Intel Core Ultra 5, and the Asus Zenbook 14 Snapdragon X X1.\n\nPlease help me, I'm having a hard time deciding.",

I'm wondering if anyone has had this issue or what I should do and how to solve it.\n\nMy Zephyrus G15 GA503RW (that has a laptop RTX 3070ti in it) did a weird thing three weeks ago where the external monitor (connected over USB-C to DisplayPort) suddenly stopped working. All of a sudden, the NVidia app claimed that there were no drivers installed and Windows Device Manager simply stated \"Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)\"\n\nI reinstalled the nvidia drivers but nothing happened - the GPU just wouldn't come back.\n\nA week later, I saw that some new nvidia drivers had released and I thought that I would give it another shot. Lo and behold, suddenly my GPU was back and everything worked flawlessly once again.\n\n**Until today**.\n\nNow, the same thing happened again. The external monitor started showing artefacts so I unplugged it and plugged it back in. Everything was fine, then the entire computer crashed and restarted a few minutes later. Now, the device is stopped because it has reported problems and the nvidia app says no drivers are installed. Reinstalling does nothing. I have cleaned out the display drivers using DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) in safe mode and attempted to install the drivers again. No dice.\n\nIs the GPU on my Zephyrus G15 just cooked or is there something that I can do to get it working again?",

I‚Äôm worried that one day it might just stop working altogether.\n\nWith Windows 10 support ending (or already ended), I‚Äôm wondering:\n\n1)Do you think it‚Äôs worth trying to repair it?\n\n2) Or should I just move on and buy a new laptop? Which 13 inches one or smaller would you recommend? \n\n3) Do refurbished laptops last?

My needs are pretty simple ‚Äî mostly Microsoft Office and iCloud ‚Äî nothing heavy. Someone suggested getting a laptop with an Intel Core i5, saying it would be enough for my use, but I can‚Äôt help feeling that would be a step backward.\n\nThanks for reading and for any advice!",

So here is the brief: \n\n* ¬£1200 per machine\n* Lightweight\n* Great battery life\n* Powerful CPU for dealing with heavyweight database type work.\n* 15 or 16 inch\n* 16gig of ram\n* SSD size doesn't matter, we are server-based.\n* No GPU needed.\n* Good quality keyboard.\n* Good quality chassis.\n\nI was impressed with this review of the Elitebook X G1i, although it is too expensive and too small but this is where my research has started. I'm obviously looking at Lenovo's and figuring out the new Dell naming schemes. Any help appreciated.\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I shared my thoughts to my friends about needing to get a laptop for my college work, as it's becoming a bigger hassle having to work on my PC to edit, program, or just making powerpoints/documents. My initial plan was to just save up until next year to get a work laptop such as a V14 or Vivobook but it would be really nice to get one asap. My budget is around $600 max, and am based in SEA.\n\nMy friend told me he had a friend that has a Nitro 5 AN515-55 which he bought in 2021 for $1300 for his work but now upgraded to a mac, so it's been collecting some dust for a while and my friend said he could hook me up to buy it from him.\n\nWhat I'm looking for was really something not too bulky with a good screen, something that just works smoothly for document work, powerpoints, light coding, light video editing, and lightroom. I may or may not switch it to Linux but since it's an RTX 2060 I'm probably not going to.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "selftext": "So as the title suggests I want advice, I need a laptop that can run games like Minecraft, terraria, and some shooter games like Apex legends and COD. Im mainly looking for something with pretty good specs but within about 200 - 500 dollars, I should be able to get that by the end of the year. Im currently using an old PC that runs kinda bad, it has a Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-4130 @3.40GHz CPU and a NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030 GPU with 8 gigs DDR3. I used to be an Xbox player but I've had all three of my Xbox ones break on me due to hardware breaking out of my control so im done with it and want something more reliable and useful. Any advice will be helpful, even if you dont have advice than you for reading.",

    "selftext": "After trying out Apple's M4 MacBook Air, it's really nice and the M series chipsets are very powerful and snappy! The displays are beautiful too! The one little niche issue that made me return it and want to buy a Windows laptop, specifically a ThinkPad, is universal compatibility with external devices such as mice and other USB-A devices. I hate the fact that I have to buy multiple adapters just to use my Razer mouse or Blue Yeti microphone with the MacBook.. and there's this weird noticeable \"lag\" or jaggedness to the mouse cursor and its movements on the Mac no matter how much I tinker with the settings. It just doesn't feel as natural and fluid as it does on a Windows computer. It's little things like that that are deal breakers for me no matter how top quality some of the other specs are. Anyway, for me it's a ThinkPad or nothing. Specifically the T series with AMD. Is this a good buy? The specific model is 21MCOOOCUS. It says that the RAM is upgradable up to 64gb which is awesome as I plan to eventually throw 32gb in there and maybe a 1tb ssd if I need to down the road. Thoughts? Are there better T series AMD models for around the same price?\nOr should I just pull the trigger now? Thanks!",

IF i need a new one, any recommendations? i am a biology major so not too heavy on computer stuff but definitely need something sturdy  and reliable. i was thinking of getting a mac next bc i have the iphone & ipad but i know that they kinda suck, are very expensive, and hard to play TS4 on. advice please!!",

She doesn't have the monitor issues - yet. I imagine it's a matter of time. I could read over on r/lenovo on earlier threads that other people report this issue.\n\n  \nIs it something you guys have experienced also?

However, when they checked the laptop, it suddenly worked fine. So they said there was no issue at all.\n\nBut when I got it back, it started happening again. So they suggested it might be a socket problem at home, but all my devices charge fine at home. I got busy and all so I did not use the laptop for a few weeks. Then now, it won‚Äôt charge at all and the battery got drained.\n\nSo I brought it back to the repair shop, then they told me it was a motherboard problem, maybe. They said they have ordered some parts to fix it. However, it still didn‚Äôt work and told me they can‚Äôt repair it anymore.\n\nSo my question is‚Ä¶ is my laptop really not fixable anymore?

IF i need a new one, any recommendations? i am a biology major so not too heavy on computer stuff but definitely need something sturdy  and reliable. i was thinking of getting a mac next bc i have the iphone & ipad but i know that they kinda suck, are very expensive, and hard to play TS4 on. advice please!!",

    "selftext": "Hello guys, I have a problem with video rendering which I can't quiet wrap my head around. Whenever I am exporting 360 video footage in Premiere Pro my computer becomes practically unsuable. The browser won't load properly beyond 10 tabs, YouTube has insanely choppy playback, websites with a lot of graphical elements won't open, desktop apps like steam or discord have a 4 second delay after clicking something. \n\nOn the one hand, I recognize that rendering 8k footage on my older system takes a heavy toll on my PC, on the other hand, when I open task manager I see that there are plenty of resources still available. My CPU never exceeds 45%, my GPU hovers around 80%, and my RAM usage goes up to like 70% max. On paper, there should be plenty of excess resources for my PC to function without delay. Morevoer, whenever I am gaming at similar level of hardware usage, I can easily watch videos on the second monitor and google stuff without delay. \n\nI am going to be upgrading my PC soon and I want to make sure that it can handle 8K video rendering and still remain functional for browsing, watching videos, interacting with simple desktop apps like STEAM or Microsoft Teams. \n\nMy specs: \n\nGPU: RTX 2080 Super\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 3950x\n\nRAM: 64GB Corsair\n\nSSD: 512GB WD system drive and 4TB Samsung drive  \n  \nAll drivers are up to date, no viruses as far as I can tell, I never download questionable stuff. No third-party anti-virus software either. The PC has less than 15 apps (aside from games) installed in total, so nothing should be eating away resources in the background. \n\n  \nI also tested other software, like Davinci Resolve, Vegas Pro 21, and PowerDirector. No major differences in terms of impact on performace. \n\nWhich components should I focus on to avoid this issue in my future build? GPU? More RAM?\n\n  \nThanks in advance!\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I'm stuck in a bit of an annoying situation with my current outdated build.\n\nI've had this rig for well over 5 years now, and it is definitely showing its age. I recently got a second-hand RTX 2060 from my brother, and it's now more clear than ever that my CPU is bottlenecking me hard.\n\nI'm currently rocking an i5 8600k, and while it's always boosted at a comfy cool temp thanks to my dual tower cooler, it's just not cutting it anymore, and I'm seeing it pinned at 100% usage in basically every game I play, most commonly Marvel Rivals these days, which results in the game normally running 90-120fps at 1440p on low settings and with 0% DLSS sharpening, but with frequent and frustrating stutters when the CPU can't keep up.\n\nI was looking into bringing my rig to the new age by upgrading to a lower-end AM5 CPU with the intention to upgrade to a X3D CPU down the line, but the total cost required to purchase a new CPU, MoBo and DDR5 RAM is looking like a hefty bill in the range of $500, not even to mention replacing my case with something with I/O to take advantage of the new board (especially considering I have broken front panel ports on my current case that I've been dying to replace)\n\nSuddenly it it hit me today that instead of upgrading basically my entire PC I may be able to get away with just upgrading the CPU if I can stay within the same socket type, and sure enough it looks like I can get my hands on a used i9 9900k in the ballpark of $200. This way I wouldn't need to upgrade literally anything else, not even my cooler.\n\nThe question is though, is the money I save by doing this worth keeping my rig effectively outdated and taking a risk on a used chip? Would upgrading to the 9900k actually give me any noticeable performance increase with a 2060?\n\nI'd love to hear some opinions of those who've used this chip before, thanks in advance!",

If anyone would like to spend some time with me and explain everything, it will be very very appreciated.\n\nHere is everything that is important:\n- I will be buying everything in Poland\n- My budget is around 2000-2200$ (7000-8000z≈Ç)\n- I mostly play League of Legends, Fortnite and The Sims 3\n- I want it to look good, with some RGB and cool fans\n- I already have a keyboard, one monitor and mouse\n\n\nI should also mention that I'd love to have a lot of fps when playing with highest settings and that the PC would last me a looong time.\n\nThank you for your help in advance\nI don't want a complete parts list.\nI'm aware of the pcpartpicker page but there are so many options lol.",

I was able to keep my humidity between 45% and 55% during summer using a mix of my A/C unit and a dehumidifier that I bought.\n\nLiving in the northeast U.S., fall and winter now means cold weather and cold weather means dry air. it is getting down to 25-30% humidity in my room already and will only get lower. I want to keep my humidity between 45% and 55%.\n\nSo, I bought a humidifier. The Levoit Superior 6000S Evaporative Humidifier. It cost $225. \n\nDoes anyone else have this humidifier or a humidifier in general? If so, is it OK to be in the same room as my PC? I plan on keeping it as far away from my PC as possible.\n\nJust want to ensure that my PC isn‚Äôt intaking straight moisture as I‚Äôm sure that would be worse than low humidity and I just want to ensure that the PC I spent a lot of money on doesn‚Äôt get damaged and stays around without damage for years and years to come.\n\nThanks so much.",

I don't know what it's like in other EU countries.",

There's nothing particularly wrong with the 3060Ti. It's still doing what I need it to do and hasn't really kept me from playing anything I want to play. But I feel like GPUs are quickly running away from me and I might never upgrade if I don't do it soon. The goal is to upgrade and stretch this current build another 5 to 8 years if possible. What's holding me back based on my build below? I assume if I upgrade the GPU, I'll need to upgrade the power supply with it.\n\nI know nothing about AMD GPUs, I've been a Geforce guy since my first build 20 years ago. Totally open to AMD or whatever is my best bet. Whats my splurge option? What's my value option? What's my best option? Are these easy to find? My local Microcenter has plenty of ASUS NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Prime Triple Fan 12GB GDDR7 in stock for $550.

Where as just upgrading to a 4090/5090 seems overkill for 1440p and upgrading the whole PC feels like money better spent. Seems counterintuitive to perhaps buy the 4k/5080 combo and run it on 1440p as well.\n\nAgain, thanks in advance to anyone willing to help, cheers!",

My budget only allows for an LGA 1700 with a 12400F, and in the future, when I have the money, I can get a 14600F. Yes, I understand that Intel is significantly inferior to AMD, but AM4 with a 55600 is a dead end, and I don't have enough money to get to AM5, so LGA1700 is somewhere in between.  \nI heard that the 14600KF consumes a lot of power, so it needs a good VRM with good heatsinks. Is the VRM cooling on the Maxsun Challenger b760m good enough? (I want it because it costs $70 in my region)  \nOr should I not worry about this?",

And if so, will they give me a decent experience? I am no pro, but i would like to have an above average build for competitive purposes. I am least confident in my Storage choice, all I know is that NVMe is preferable, and Gen4 is nice for a mid-range build.  \n\nAny feedback would be much appreciated, thank you in advance for any advice you are able to contribute!",

I've had it paired with a 3080 since and still now, and while it performed great, I thought it should be better. I've played all the biggest releases on it getting decent fps on a mix high/max settings as I preferred my games to look good on my 1440p 144h monitor especially in single player games than try to reach my refresh rate and I was satisfied with it because I thought that was my ceiling for me! But holy SHIT I never thought with this card I could run battlefield 6 at MAX settings, 1440p, stream it on discord, and hover 100+ fps all with my new 7800x3d!!! It was on sale for at a microcenter near me for $299 and thought wow I had to purchase this right away. I am so glad I did. My gaming and even just doing simple computer task has never been better. I feel like I can run any game with this duo and I'm just so happy. Maybe it's the upgrade to DDR5 ram as well but wow if you're thinking about upgrading to the 7800x3d right now it's so good!!!!

Whenever I am exporting 360 video footage in Premiere Pro my computer becomes practically unsuable. The browser won't load properly beyond 10 tabs, YouTube has insanely choppy playback, websites with a lot of graphical elements won't open, desktop apps like steam or discord have a 4 second delay after clicking something. \n\nOn the one hand, I recognize that rendering 8k footage on my older system takes a heavy toll on my PC, on the other hand, when I open task manager I see that there are plenty of resources still available. My CPU never exceeds 45%, my GPU hovers around 80%, and my RAM usage goes up to like 70% max. On paper, there should be plenty of excess resources for my PC to function without delay. Morevoer, whenever I am gaming at similar level of hardware usage, I can easily watch videos on the second monitor and google stuff without delay. \n\nI am going to be upgrading my PC soon and I want to make sure that it can handle 8K video rendering and still remain functional for browsing, watching videos, interacting with simple desktop apps like STEAM or Microsoft Teams. \n\nMy specs: \n\nGPU: RTX 2080 Super\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 3950x\n\nRAM: 64GB Corsair\n\nSSD: 512GB WD system drive and 4TB Samsung drive  \n  \nAll drivers are up to date, no viruses as far as I can tell, I never download questionable stuff. No third-party anti-virus software either. The PC has less than 15 apps (aside from games) installed in total, so nothing should be eating away resources in the background. \n\n  \nI also tested other software, like Davinci Resolve, Vegas Pro 21, and PowerDirector. No major differences in terms of impact on performace. \n\nWhich components should I focus on to avoid this issue in my future build? GPU? More RAM?\n\n  \nThanks in advance!\n\n",

I recently got a second-hand RTX 2060 from my brother, and it's now more clear than ever that my CPU is bottlenecking me hard.\n\nI'm currently rocking an i5 8600k, and while it's always boosted at a comfy cool temp thanks to my dual tower cooler, it's just not cutting it anymore, and I'm seeing it pinned at 100% usage in basically every game I play, most commonly Marvel Rivals these days, which results in the game normally running 90-120fps at 1440p on low settings and with 0% DLSS sharpening, but with frequent and frustrating stutters when the CPU can't keep up.\n\nI was looking into bringing my rig to the new age by upgrading to a lower-end AM5 CPU with the intention to upgrade to a X3D CPU down the line, but the total cost required to purchase a new CPU, MoBo and DDR5 RAM is looking like a hefty bill in the range of $500, not even to mention replacing my case with something with I/O to take advantage of the new board (especially considering I have broken front panel ports on my current case that I've been dying to replace)\n\nSuddenly it it hit me today that instead of upgrading basically my entire PC I may be able to get away with just upgrading the CPU if I can stay within the same socket type, and sure enough it looks like I can get my hands on a used i9 9900k in the ballpark of $200. This way I wouldn't need to upgrade literally anything else, not even my cooler.\n\nThe question is though, is the money I save by doing this worth keeping my rig effectively outdated and taking a risk on a used chip? Would upgrading to the 9900k actually give me any noticeable performance increase with a 2060?\n\nI'd love to hear some opinions of those who've used this chip before, thanks in advance!",

I've watched some youtube videos, read some articles and reddit but it is still not clocking and idk where to start lol. I don't know how to pick the parts (I think that's my biggest problem). If anyone would like to spend some time with me and explain everything, it will be very very appreciated.\n\nHere is everything that is important:\n- I will be buying everything in Poland\n- My budget is around 2000-2200$ (7000-8000z≈Ç)\n- I mostly play League of Legends, Fortnite and The Sims 3\n- I want it to look good, with some RGB and cool fans\n- I already have a keyboard, one monitor and mouse\n\n\nI should also mention that I'd love to have a lot of fps when playing with highest settings and that the PC would last me a looong time.\n\nThank you for your help in advance\nI don't want a complete parts list.\nI'm aware of the pcpartpicker page but there are so many options lol.",

I was able to keep my humidity between 45% and 55% during summer using a mix of my A/C unit and a dehumidifier that I bought.\n\nLiving in the northeast U.S., fall and winter now means cold weather and cold weather means dry air. it is getting down to 25-30% humidity in my room already and will only get lower. I want to keep my humidity between 45% and 55%.\n\nSo, I bought a humidifier. The Levoit Superior 6000S Evaporative Humidifier. It cost $225. \n\nDoes anyone else have this humidifier or a humidifier in general? If so, is it OK to be in the same room as my PC? I plan on keeping it as far away from my PC as possible.\n\nJust want to ensure that my PC isn‚Äôt intaking straight moisture as I‚Äôm sure that would be worse than low humidity and I just want to ensure that the PC I spent a lot of money on doesn‚Äôt get damaged and stays around without damage for years and years to come.\n\nThanks so much.",

There's nothing particularly wrong with the 3060Ti. It's still doing what I need it to do and hasn't really kept me from playing anything I want to play. But I feel like GPUs are quickly running away from me and I might never upgrade if I don't do it soon. The goal is to upgrade and stretch this current build another 5 to 8 years if possible. What's holding me back based on my build below? I assume if I upgrade the GPU, I'll need to upgrade the power supply with it.\n\nI know nothing about AMD GPUs, I've been a Geforce guy since my first build 20 years ago. Totally open to AMD or whatever is my best bet. Whats my splurge option? What's my value option? What's my best option? Are these easy to find? My local Microcenter has plenty of ASUS NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Prime Triple Fan 12GB GDDR7 in stock for $550. That seems like a no brainer upgrade for basically the same price as what I paid for my 3060Ti. Should I jump on that?\n\nAny help would be amazing!\n\nTotally open to criticisms / bashing as well.

I've had it paired with a 3080 since and still now, and while it performed great, I thought it should be better. I've played all the biggest releases on it getting decent fps on a mix high/max settings as I preferred my games to look good on my 1440p 144h monitor especially in single player games than try to reach my refresh rate and I was satisfied with it because I thought that was my ceiling for me! But holy SHIT I never thought with this card I could run battlefield 6 at MAX settings, 1440p, stream it on discord, and hover 100+ fps all with my new 7800x3d!!! It was on sale for at a microcenter near me for $299 and thought wow I had to purchase this right away. I am so glad I did. My gaming and even just doing simple computer task has never been better. I feel like I can run any game with this duo and I'm just so happy. Maybe it's the upgrade to DDR5 ram as well but wow if you're thinking about upgrading to the 7800x3d right now it's so good!!!!

    "selftext": "Hey all,  \nI‚Äôm planning a GPU upgrade at some point down the road ‚Äî not immediately ‚Äî and I‚Äôm just gathering suggestions for now.\n\nSetup: I have two monitors connected but I‚Äôll only game on one (1440p). The second monitor will be used for browser/chat/Discord.\n\nWhat I‚Äôm considering: the newer AMD RX 9070 XT.\n\nSome context:\n\n* Gaming on one 1440p monitor.\n* I‚Äôd like the card to be ‚Äúfuture-proof-ish‚Äù for a few years.\n* Open to AMD or NVIDIA.\n* I‚Äôm in Germany, so prices are usually higher than in the US (VAT, no Micro Center). I don‚Äôt have a strict budget at the moment ‚Äî just looking for thoughts and recommendations.\n\nQuestions I‚Äôd love help with:\n\n1. How does the RX 9070 XT handle 1440p gaming (especially for a title like Monster Hunter Wilds)?\n2. Is something like the RTX 5070 Ti worth the premium here in Germany (I‚Äôve seen it around ‚Ç¨900)? Where‚Äôs the sweet spot for price vs. performance?\n3. Any other card suggestions or value options that make more sense in Germany/Europe?\n4. Given I have two monitors but only game on one, are there GPU features I should prioritise (VRAM, ports, features for multi-monitor use, NVIDIA Raytracing or FSR, etc.)?\n\nThanks in advance ‚Äî I‚Äôll pull the trigger when it feels right; for now I‚Äôm just trying to gather good options and opinions.",

    "selftext": "(Sorry for bad english) Hello. I want to build a computer with at least some upgrade potential. My budget only allows for an LGA 1700 with a 12400F, and in the future, when I have the money, I can get a 14600F. Yes, I understand that Intel is significantly inferior to AMD, but AM4 with a 55600 is a dead end, and I don't have enough money to get to AM5, so LGA1700 is somewhere in between.  \nI heard that the 14600KF consumes a lot of power, so it needs a good VRM with good heatsinks. Is the VRM cooling on the Maxsun Challenger b760m good enough? (I want it because it costs $70 in my region)  \nOr should I not worry about this?",

It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pok√©mon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today¬†announced a new partnership¬†with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by¬†Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also¬†just broke¬†that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners‚Äîa group of investors‚Äîwould be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game‚Äôs many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroƒülu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2¬†is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If¬†The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the sameÔªø experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original‚Äôs formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player‚Äôs ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however‚Äîparticularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn‚Äôt a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste ‚Äì it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio‚Äôs vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I‚Äôll admit, there‚Äôs a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [S√∂nke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw ‚Äì it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine ‚Äî sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices ‚Äî all wrapped in Obsidian‚Äôs signature corporate satire. It‚Äôs funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it‚Äôs a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galv√£o](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved‚Äîbitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting‚Äîbut without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Micha≈Ç Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom‚Äîthough a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian‚Äôs brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland‚Äîalmost forgettable‚Äîcompanions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It‚Äôs a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn‚Äôt lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you‚Äôll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran ≈Ωalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

Too afraid to alienate players and make big swings like the setting deserves.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nexus Hub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus-hub)** - [Andrew Logue](https://opencritic.com/critic/3996/andrew-logue) - [8 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves if it ain‚Äôt broke, make it bigger and prettier - a solid sequel that expands upon the first game in meaningful ways, though some fans might experience a bit of d√©j√† vu.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Vincent Ternida](https://opencritic.com/critic/8412/vincent-ternida) - [8 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a title well worth exploring, offering accessible gameplay and thoughtful quality-of-life enhancements that cater to both newcomers and returning fans. While it doesn‚Äôt radically reinvent the formula, it delivers a satisfying action RPG experience that scratches the adventure itch and rewards players who engage with its missions in full.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PPE.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/642/ppe-pl)** - [Patryk Dziƒôglewicz](https://opencritic.com/critic/8235/patryk-dzi-glewicz) - *Polish* - [8 / 10](https://www.ppe.pl/recenzje/387599/the-outer-worlds-2-recenzja-gry-chciwosc-kontra-totalitaryzm.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 may not revolutionize what we saw in the first installment, but it significantly improves on familiar elements. If you're in the mood for a great space opera with a satirical twist and RPG elements, you should definitely give this shooter a try.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pizza Fria](https://opencritic.com/outlet/915/pizza-fria)** - [Leandro Felippe de Paiva¬†Gomes](https://opencritic.com/critic/10798/leandro-felippe-de-paiva-gomes) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://pizzafria.ig.com.br/analises/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 manages to captivate with its charismatic cast of characters, a world that truly rewards exploration, and a good variety of approaches and choices that generate real consequences in the player's journey.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Timothy Nunes](https://opencritic.com/critic/846/timothy-nunes) - [9 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-ps5/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 excels on almost all fronts, presenting you with an open RPG that lets you choose how you progress while still keeping you on a clear path. The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you‚Äôll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avil√©s](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it‚Äôs the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could‚Äôve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It‚Äôs packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that‚Äôll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie‚Äôs Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It‚Äôs pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn‚Äôt Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of¬†The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but¬†TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

    "selftext": "To be more specific, Massive Entertainment put out a social media statement implying that they're encouraging staff to voluntarily leave the company/lay themselves off with benefits/company assistance:\n\n\"As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games. To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that¬†[Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed)¬†It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pok√©mon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today¬†announced a new partnership¬†with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by¬†Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also¬†just broke¬†that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners‚Äîa group of investors‚Äîwould be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game‚Äôs many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroƒülu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2¬†is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If¬†The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the sameÔªø experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original‚Äôs formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player‚Äôs ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however‚Äîparticularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn‚Äôt a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste ‚Äì it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio‚Äôs vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I‚Äôll admit, there‚Äôs a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [S√∂nke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw ‚Äì it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine ‚Äî sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices ‚Äî all wrapped in Obsidian‚Äôs signature corporate satire. It‚Äôs funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it‚Äôs a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galv√£o](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved‚Äîbitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting‚Äîbut without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Micha≈Ç Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom‚Äîthough a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian‚Äôs brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth.

Unfortunately, technical issues, bland‚Äîalmost forgettable‚Äîcompanions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It‚Äôs a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn‚Äôt lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you‚Äôll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran ≈Ωalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features. The Outer Worlds 2 showcases impressive narrative adaptability to player choices, lacking only a bit of technical ambition and polish to rank among the best role-playing games of today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[INVEN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/805/inven)** - [Kyuman Kim](https://opencritic.com/critic/9273/kyuman-kim) - *Korean* - [8.2 / 10](https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=310629)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 showcases Obsidian's RPG mastery through meaningful choices and dynamic character building, though the world lacks the vibrancy of modern open-world games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Just Play it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/936/just-play-it)** - [Aimen TAIB](https://opencritic.com/critic/10987/aimen-taib) - *Arabic* - [7.5 / 10](https://justplayit.info/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 may not be suitable for all players due to its complex narrative, but it‚Äôs undoubtedly a fitting choice for those seeking a deep RPG experience that demands thought and analysis. It offers you the freedom to choose a path that aligns with your own direction, both in terms of story and gameplay. However, it still suffers from several issues that need fixing.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Loot Level Chill](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)** - [Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser) - [9 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deceptively smart Looter-shooter RPG with colourful worlds and entertaining characters, and some really satisfying, malleable combat.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MondoXbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/794/mondoxbox)** - [Giuseppe Genga](https://opencritic.com/critic/7638/giuseppe-genga) - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.mondoxbox.com/recensione/3825/the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 improves upon its predecessor in mission design, combat, and meaningful player choice, offering a solid sci-fi RPG experience.

The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you‚Äôll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avil√©s](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it‚Äôs the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could‚Äôve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It‚Äôs packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that‚Äôll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie‚Äôs Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It‚Äôs pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn‚Äôt Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of¬†The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but¬†TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pok√©mon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

The integration of the standby clock together with the mirrored view of the O11 Vision Chrome, gave a very good finish, where you can only observe the screen without the edges.\n\nThe only point of attention:\n\nIt was not possible to use the tapes that came with the screen. I used velcro so that there was space to keep the rubbers in place and be easy to remove for future cleaning routines. \n\nIf you have a CPU-STRIMER like me, it can be difficult to place due to the available space and the tension that the wires make pressing the screen. But once again, velcro solved this problem.\n\nFor those who want something new on their PC in addition to the hardware, it is a good aesthetic option.",

    "selftext": "First of all, I want to say that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis post is not to troll or be a ragebait. I'm not against those people who like, use or share Windows-relates stuff. I myself use many different operating system on different computers and I like them all in their own way.\n\nI have been a member of this great community for a long time and have been following people's posts very actively for several years. It has been great! However, I have noticed a trend here that does not seem to make sense: people seem to be against posts and comments that bring up other computers that are not Windows-based computers. These comments and posts which are related to non-Windows stuff are usually downvoted heavily for no good obvious reason. And I think why that would be.\n\nPeople often seem to associate the name PC with Windows computers. This is because most users use Windows as a desktop and have grown to understand that PC automatically means a Windows computer. I want to make clear that the term \"PC\" simply refers to general-purpose electronic computer designed to be operated directly by an individual end-user. So a PC is not strictly dependent on an operating system, desktop environment or software environment. Several posts that I have seen here related to, for example, BSD-based computers, MacOS computers or Linux computers are very unpopular and these posts are downright hated with emotion in most cases it seems.\n\nI am writing this because I would like to see this community grow even bigger by having more posts that are related to large spectre of PCs, not just posts which are somehow related to Windows-based computers (like gaming on Windows PC), and to clear some of the misunderstanding related to the term \"PC\". Having more posts and being more open-minded about different varieties of PCs would make this subreddit much more interesting than it already is. This should be possible, if people understand what the term PC means and if people also give those non-Windows posts a chance. This would bring a new perspective for people on how people use computers, why we like them and what they could actually be.\n\nThank you.",

I was able to keep my humidity between 45% and 55% during summer using a mix of my A/C unit and a dehumidifier that I bought.\n\nLiving in the northeast U.S., fall and winter now means cold weather and cold weather means dry air. it is getting down to 25-30% humidity in my room already and will only get lower. I want to keep my humidity between 45% and 55%.\n\nSo, I bought a humidifier. The Levoit Superior 6000S Evaporative Humidifier. It cost $225. \n\nDoes anyone else have this humidifier or a humidifier in general? If so, is it OK to be in the same room as my PC? I plan on keeping it as far away from my PC as possible.\n\nJust want to ensure that my PC isn‚Äôt intaking straight moisture as I‚Äôm sure that would be worse than low humidity and I just want to ensure that the PC I spent a lot of money on doesn‚Äôt get damaged and stays around without damage for years and years to come.\n\nThanks so much.",

    "selftext": "About 4 months ago, my old PSU decided to go out with a bang ‚Äî literally. A capacitor exploded shortly after booting up.  \nConsidering it was from a brand nobody has ever heard of and over 12 years old, I couldn‚Äôt really complain. It had served me well, and it was whisper quiet until the end.  \nSince I needed a replacement ASAP, I went to a local store and picked up a [Gigabyte P650G](https://www.gigabyte.com/it/Power-Supply/GP-P650G), mostly because of the 80+ Gold certification and those ‚ÄúJapanese capacitors‚Äù (still traumatized by the previous explosion üòÖ).  \nRight away, I noticed it was much louder than my old PSU, but I figured I could live with that.\n\nThen, about a month later‚Ä¶ it started making some very questionable noises.[Here‚Äôs the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1acXTTO0gwIlTaB7rc47JefxOvfjauzvX/view?usp=drive_link)  \nI contacted Gigabyte support. They replied the next day asking for a video (the same one above).\n\nDue to personal stuff, I only replied two months later.  \nA week later, they answered saying the link permissions were wrong.  \nI fixed it immediately ‚Äî they replied again a few minutes later ‚Äî and then took six more business days to finally give me this response:\n\n    Dear dudo1985,\n    \n    From the video, it is coil whine. Kindly understand it is normal to have a little bit noise from electronic components. It will not affect the performance. Nevertheless, if you still feel concern on the product and required engineer to check the issue on the power supply directly, you may contact your vendor (where you purchase the device) for further investigation.\n    \n    Feel free to contact us again anytime if you have any feedback or need any support from us. Cases without updates in 7 days will be closed until further information is received.\n    \n    Regards,\n    GIGABYTE\n\nNeedless to say, I‚Äôll **never buy anything from them again.**",

    "selftext": "Ever since I built my first PC back in 2018, I‚Äôve been a die-hard full-tower guy. RGB fans, custom water cooling you name it. Cuz¬† r/pcmasterrace taught me that ‚Äúbigger is better.‚Äù\n\nBut after moving into a small apartment last month, my 70-pound rig started feeling less like a hobby and more like a piece of furniture. So my friend told me that i can¬† grab an acemagic F3A mini on amazon and it turns out you don‚Äôt need a giant case to feel like a proper PC enthusiast.\n\nLet‚Äôs talk specs first: Ryzen 7 6800HS, 16GB of DDR5 (I upgraded to 32GB because I hoard data), and a 1TB NVMe SSD pulled from my old build. It scores around 15,000 in Cinebench R23 multi-core about the same as my old i7-10700K, but packed into a box roughly the size of an Xbox Series S.\n\nI do some light gaming on it: League of Legends, Valorant, and a bit of Genshin Impact. League runs 110+ FPS at 1080p on high, Valorant hits around 90‚Äì100 FPS on medium, and Genshin stays around 45 FPS at 1080p medium. It‚Äôs not 4K 120 FPS, but that‚Äôs fine, this is my ‚Äúafter work wind-down‚Äù setup, and it handles that perfectly.\n\nPort selection honestly surprised me. Two USB 3.2 ports, a Type-C, and a 3.5mm jack on the front (a must for my old gaming headset). On the back, one HDMI, two more USB 3.0 ports, and gigabit Ethernet. I‚Äôve got it hooked up to a 27\" monitor, mechanical keyboard, mouse, and an external SSD no hub needed, no cable mess. The bottom panel pops off easily, so I threw in a 2TB HDD for old games and media.\n\nNow, the downsides:  \n The fan gets loud under load. When rendering or gaming for an hour, noise hits around 55dB enough to drown out a podcast, though not quite a jet engine.  \n The stock SSD wasn‚Äôt great, so I swapped it on day one (you could stick with it if you‚Äôre not picky).  \n Customer support took about two days to reply when I asked about a BIOS update. Not terrible, but not ASUS-level fast either. Maybe we have time gap cuz it from China.\n\nOverall, if you‚Äôre a practical PC user who wants solid performance without sacrificing desk space or you need a capable secondary setup for work and casual gaming the acemagic F3A is definitely worth a look.\n\n",

I just started Expedition 33 on game pass and am looking to get Ghost of Tsushima, Elden Ring, and assasins creed shadows, to give you an idea what I like.\n\nRyzen 9700\nRadeon 9060xt 16gb\n32gb ddr5 @6000\n2tb SSD\n",

Today when I tried to turn it on it turned on for a second then shut off. Next try qled indicates dram error, I thought it was weird cuz how can ram die overnight. Anyway, i did some testing and somehow it indicated that both sticks died. After like 2 hours of searching, I tried to reseat the cpu. Then, boom, qled indicates cpu error, I remove the cpu, clean the socket and the cpu, put it pack on and turn it on, DRAM error.\nAfter another hour or so of trying to reseat the ram, it finally turns on with one stick and boots and automatically enters the BIOS then it randomly restarts itself and the DRAM error is back on, somehow managed to get it off after a few restarts, then BOOT error is on (even tho my ssd is plugged in). Another restart another DRAM error, it restarts itself a few times until it boots, then Windows crash and I just gave up.\n\nMy build: \nMb: Asus Prime B550-Plus \nCpu: Ryzen 7 5800x \nRam: 2x 8GB corsair vegnance 3000Mhz\nGpu: Rtx 3070 8gb vram \nPsu: CV650",

So, I bought this keyboard for gaming and work, but a couple of months ago, one of my keys started not responding properly. I thought it needed some cleaning, so I removed the key caps around it and itself, and cleaned it, but then it still doesn't resolve the issue, so I ignored it, and after another few months, that one key that didn't work properly seems to affect the other keys too; the other key also started not responding properly and now it just ANNOYING AS HELL.\n\nI thought it stopped responding properly due to overuse, then I realised if that's the case, is it common for a keyboard to have various problems after being overused for years? And btw, did it start affecting the other keys because I removed the keycaps? Can someone help me with this problem, please?\n\nAnd if I have to buy another keyboard, suggest some great, reliable, long-lasting keyboard company, for budget and expensive ones (if I had the money, ofc) and also tell me how to maintain a mechanical keyboard properly, so that this issue or something similar won\\`t happen.\n\nFeel free to ask any further questions to resolve this issue.",

    "selftext": "Hello. I have recently built a new PC with the following specs:\n\n7500F\n\n9070 XT\n\nDDR5 6000 CL30\n\nI have already enabled PBO and EXPO, so I shouldn't be leaving any performance on the table.\n\nWhile the Cinebench and 3DMark scores and temperatures were fine, I tried the built-in benchmark in Marvel Rivals and realized that my average and 1% low FPS are around 10% slower than they should be. I am comparing my results to Hardware Unboxed's tests.\n\nMy results over 3 runs:\n\n720p Medium: 155 FPS AVG, 107 FPS 1% Low\n\n720p Ultra: 125 FPS AVG, 92 FPS 1% Low\n\nFunny enough, the ultra result was way closer than the medium result but I'm guessing that's only because it is more GPU-bound compared to medium. Both tests were CPU bottlenecked though, even though ultra preset was heavier on the GPU.\n\nAs I said, the temps were totally fine so no thermal throttling here and Cinebench also showed \"no\" for all thermal throttling tests. Any idea why this might happen?",

Option 2: go for amd5 build so new mobo, 32gb ddr5, ryzen 7 9700x and rtx5070. I would keep case, cpu cooler, 2 nvme disks, fans, 700W psu (should be enough for both options), ecc.

I ended up getting a 5070 Ti instead. \n\nSo I‚Äôve got one again to put in my second PC I‚Äôve got hooked up to the living room TV. I did the install (DDU then new drivers for the GPU), and tested out a few games. It worked fine, and performed great. \n\nSo later while I‚Äôm browsing the internet, it starts flickering. It happens when I‚Äôm on a website with embedded videos. It happened on Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram. It will flicker whenever a video comes onto, and exits the screen. So back to back videos in the feed make it flicker a lot. \n\nI also noticed it will change the color temp of the screen when it flickers. Like it will look warmer, and then go back to cooler. It‚Äôs not quite as drastic as turning on the built in blue light filter (night light or whatever it‚Äôs called), but it‚Äôs definitely noticeable. \n\nWhere would I start looking to fix this? I‚Äôm going to try a different HDMI cable later, bit this one worked fine previously. \n\nHere‚Äôs a video of the issue. As you can see, it flickers as I scroll through videos. If I stop scrolling, it stops flickering.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_sTuIh2xLg0?si=ahiekoB3tY5rYZeW\n",

While I am a hard linux lover, I realistically need bare metal windows for some of my research projects. \n\nSo, after 8 long years I decided to upgrade, I am choosing an i9-10940X. Yes, I know it is over priced but I had one constraint I wanted to get right: I run 256 gb of ram due to the virtual machines I sometimes need. And I didn‚Äôt have the cash for a thread ripper. \n\nThis is the first time I do a major upgrade to my computer, feels exciting and nostalgic. I guess I will build a second desktop with my old mob, cpu and the components I have upgraded from my first build over the years. Feels a bit like the ship of theseus",

The integration of the standby clock together with the mirrored view of the O11 Vision Chrome, gave a very good finish, where you can only observe the screen without the edges.\n\nThe only point of attention:\n\nIt was not possible to use the tapes that came with the screen. I used velcro so that there was space to keep the rubbers in place and be easy to remove for future cleaning routines. \n\nIf you have a CPU-STRIMER like me, it can be difficult to place due to the available space and the tension that the wires make pressing the screen. But once again, velcro solved this problem.\n\nFor those who want something new on their PC in addition to the hardware, it is a good aesthetic option.",

I might try monitor arms but my desk is a bit wobbly and I can only fit them in the little hole. I might also do wall mounting but am unsure. Any help would be appreciated. ",

I've made some upgrades based on suggestions + you can all see the full picture of my space I've been talking about (ie where the podcaster is now + mics etc and other side of the wall)\n\n**Check pictures here:** [**WIDE VIEW**](https://freeimage.host/i/pxl-20251025-011046826mp.Kr7j1zg) **|** [**CLOSE VIEW**](https://freeimage.host/i/pxl-20251025-011325535mp.Kr7kK9p)\n\n1. Added riser under monitor\n2. Added keybo/mouse pad (my old one, ordered new one to test)\n3. Added a power shelf under the table on the right\n4. FIXED the monitor tilt, more cable management, tucked computer away behind bar\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\n1. Waiting on new shelf and plants.\n2. Ordered a pegboard as well for charging station\n3. New larger grey scale mouse pad\n4. Headphones modern stand coming in Monday\n\nThank you all for the recommendations and trolling :P was fun!  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Original Post  \nFinally got around revamping my work station.\n\n* Used the [74\" IKEA Kitchen KIRBY Walnut Veneer Table Top](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/karlby-countertop-for-kitchen-island-walnut-veneer-30297641/#content)\n* Got a welder to custom build legs for me\n* Bought square leg risers to add some height + have padding on the bottom of the feet.\n* Added LED lights from Temu\n* Cable management under the monitor area via Amazon\n* Monitor arm from Amazon as well\n* Yamaha HS7 Monitor + Amazon Stands (I wish the stands were shorter but the smaller ones couldn't handle the weight)\n\nMy computer is tucked in the back under, it doesnt stick out...just an early picture ( I built without lights for the first time thinking I wouldn't care lol, wish I got a sick case, but oh well)\n\nWaiting for blackfriday to get a new chair as the current one is too old.\n\nI wanted to add shelving so I bought one but not sure where to add it lol. The left of the table is a window in the basement that throws off the whole look. I will upload an updated picture but thought I would post this to get some feedback in the meantime!",

I've paired the build with a purple and green Owlab Voice Mini, and MW Fright Night deskmat. \n\nThere's nothing better than combining multiple multiple purchases into one solid theme. Best of all both the board and macropad are wireless, which feels appropriate for a Halloween theme keeping everything untethered.\n\nThis is my 6th post that's part of #keebaweek.

Recorded on my phone so the audio is not the best and my typing looks horrendous so there is just a image. I made a silicone sheet for the bottom and put some car wheel weights on it.

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks ‚Äî band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast üôÇ.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me ‚Äî in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn‚Äôt make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they‚Äôll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly ‚Äî The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay‚Äôs voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away ‚Üí Roxette**  \nI‚Äôm still in love with Marie Fredriksson‚Äôs voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 ‚Üí Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele ‚Äî the man, the music, the attitude ‚Äî pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F ‚Üí Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The ‚Äú3‚Äù also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit ‚Äî Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 ‚Üí 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it‚Äôs probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive ‚Üí** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently‚Äôs Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt‚Äôs pure freedom, soul, happiness ‚Äî life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins‚Ä¶ and hopefully Bart‚Äôs story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy ‚Äî build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power ‚Üí N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote ‚Äútuurnn‚Äù next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in ‚Äî just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane ‚Üí** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane ‚Äî the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations ‚Üí** had to be here anyway, but this one‚Äôs a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song‚Äôs energy, Mark‚Äôs wild teenage years, his early work ‚Äî all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we‚Äôre at it‚Ä¶\n\n**P.I.J M.M ‚Üí Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite ‚Äî the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE ‚Üí Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come Through* would‚Äôve been too many ‚Äúdreams‚Äù ‚Äî and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire ‚Üí Scooter (HP Baxxter‚Äôs voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in P√©cs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously ‚Äî the best element!\n\n**Out of Space ‚Üí The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under ‚ÄúSpace‚Äù, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune‚Äôs ‚ÄúI was sent to outer space,‚Äù and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can‚Äôt Stop Raving* didn‚Äôt fit anymore üòÖ.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True ‚Üí** basically the slogan of the ‚Äô90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven‚Äôt outgrown it ‚Äî and honestly, ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù was never my strong suit üôÇ.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? ‚Üí** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I‚Äôve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here ‚Äî sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt need explaining, but I shouldn‚Äôt forget it either.\n* **NRG** ‚Äî same energy.\n* **Music** ‚Äî the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** ‚Äî clich√©, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** ‚Äî probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** ‚Äî took a while to find. Wanted something that says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fit in boxes,‚Äù kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** ‚Äî because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** ‚Äî as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** ‚Äî one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny ‚Äú-drive,‚Äù because if it‚Äôs worth doing, it‚Äôs worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn‚Äôt stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches‚Ä¶ the works.\n\nThat‚Äôs about all that fit ‚Äî for now.  \nI‚Äôve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer ‚Äî brush smears the paint, and I don‚Äôt want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the¬†***Logitech G915 TKL***¬†and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the¬†*G515*¬†with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the¬†***Keychron K1 Max***¬†with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using¬†[launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/)¬†but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use¬†[usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

Big win for us all!\n\nI'm a big fan of marbley sounds and the Hi75 is the perfect model for this. Even stock, this thing sounded great.\nI tried HMX Canglan switches on this board, which sounded great but had a more muted and thocky sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the MMD Princesses which had a slightly higher-pitched sound, which I think really helps with the marbley sound as opposed to a more deep and flat sound. I was inspired by sound tests like [this one with MMD Princesses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2iPPrgfkIo) and [this one with Epomaker Jade Blossoms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9EoDIbE9OU) which sound basically perfect to me. The former is more like what my build sounds like IRL so I'm over the moon with the sound, but I still have Jade Blossoms on the way to see what they sound like as well.\n\nI'm also pleasantly surprised by these Osume keycaps. Not only do I like the non-standard legends and gradient colors from top to bottom, the packaging itself was very thoughtful (all rows separated in different trays, and individual places in the trays labeled, as opposed to all keycaps in one enormous tray with no labeling to help). And of course as a Taiwanese guy, I loved these novelties and had to spring for those as well. :)\n\nOverall this is the most perfect build I've ever made and I'm so happy with what the market looks like in 2025.",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Found bigger silicone bumpons that dont sink into deskpads completely, fixing ‚Äúthudding‚Äù. input parts number 107091 into [Here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/), order a reasonable amount and should deliver it to you for free\n\n\nNowadays I‚Äôve been noticing that some keyboards like the Frog Mini and some if the newer Neo boards having issues with how it sounds. This is mostly due to those keyboards having pretty short feet leading to the bottom of the keyboard to touch your deskpad as it compresses due to the weight of the keyboard which causes it to ‚Äúthud‚Äù. \n\nI‚Äôve had issues with this in the past since I use a XSoft mousepad from LethalGamingGear. When i put my keyboard on my mousepad it at first sounds fine, but as the keyboard starts to sink down due to its weight, i start to hear vibrations and ‚Äúthudding‚Äù from the desk.\n\nWhile building a drawer from ikea, i noticed that it came with some silicone bumpons to reduce the noise from the contact of the wood. And now compared to the normal hemisphere silicone bumpons that keyboards usually come with, these are a bit bigger. So I thought to try them on a keyboard that is thudding, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, tall enough so that the bottom does not touch my mousepad. I did some searching to see where i can find more of these and lo and behold, ikea actually gives them for free. Simply go to the [IKEA spare parts](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/) website and input part number 107091 and it should show up. Each one comes in a pack of 2 so as long as you order a reasonable amount, they should give them to you for free delivered straight to you.\n\nEDIT: Size for comparison. Smaller original feet are from a JJW Moment https://imgur.com/a/T48CUmH",

It has the option to be either a single-handed keyboard or a normal macropad, I specifically use my copy of the board for gaming. It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB. That said, this is the [PCB Edition](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-pcb-kit) which is available on my shop if people are interested, in addition to the keycaps and 3D printed case. You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

All keys are working, only one caveat: the upper left LED is not blinking, but I am not a LED guy and its switched off any way (been using Das Keyboard Ultimate with unlabeled keys for years). Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or ‚Äúmovement‚Äù, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom ‚Äúclacky‚Äù WS Flux HE switches as well as the ‚Äúdeep clacky‚Äù WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

All are connected to my PC at the same time (don‚Äôt ask) and I just grab one depending on what I‚Äôm doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn‚Äôt want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator.

I‚Äôm an 80s baby so the thick typewriter style of SA felt oddly familiar as I definitely played with vintage typewriters and word processors. \n\nBoard is a Massdrop CTRL V1 with HMX Gulf switches.

However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws: ‚ÄÉ\n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks ‚Äî band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast üôÇ.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me ‚Äî in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn‚Äôt make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they‚Äôll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly ‚Äî The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay‚Äôs voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away ‚Üí Roxette**  \nI‚Äôm still in love with Marie Fredriksson‚Äôs voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 ‚Üí Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele ‚Äî the man, the music, the attitude ‚Äî pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F ‚Üí Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The ‚Äú3‚Äù also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit ‚Äî Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 ‚Üí 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it‚Äôs probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive ‚Üí** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently‚Äôs Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt‚Äôs pure freedom, soul, happiness ‚Äî life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins‚Ä¶ and hopefully Bart‚Äôs story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy ‚Äî build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power ‚Üí N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote ‚Äútuurnn‚Äù next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in ‚Äî just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane ‚Üí** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane ‚Äî the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations ‚Üí** had to be here anyway, but this one‚Äôs a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song‚Äôs energy, Mark‚Äôs wild teenage years, his early work ‚Äî all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we‚Äôre at it‚Ä¶\n\n**P.I.J M.M ‚Üí Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite ‚Äî the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE ‚Üí Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come Through* would‚Äôve been too many ‚Äúdreams‚Äù ‚Äî and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire ‚Üí Scooter (HP Baxxter‚Äôs voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in P√©cs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously ‚Äî the best element!\n\n**Out of Space ‚Üí The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under ‚ÄúSpace‚Äù, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune‚Äôs ‚ÄúI was sent to outer space,‚Äù and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can‚Äôt Stop Raving* didn‚Äôt fit anymore üòÖ.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True ‚Üí** basically the slogan of the ‚Äô90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven‚Äôt outgrown it ‚Äî and honestly, ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù was never my strong suit üôÇ.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? ‚Üí** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I‚Äôve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here ‚Äî sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt need explaining, but I shouldn‚Äôt forget it either.\n* **NRG** ‚Äî same energy.\n* **Music** ‚Äî the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** ‚Äî clich√©, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** ‚Äî probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** ‚Äî took a while to find. Wanted something that says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fit in boxes,‚Äù kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** ‚Äî because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** ‚Äî as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** ‚Äî one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny ‚Äú-drive,‚Äù because if it‚Äôs worth doing, it‚Äôs worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn‚Äôt stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches‚Ä¶ the works.\n\nThat‚Äôs about all that fit ‚Äî for now.  \nI‚Äôve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer ‚Äî brush smears the paint, and I don‚Äôt want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the¬†***Logitech G915 TKL***¬†and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the¬†*G515*¬†with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the¬†***Keychron K1 Max***¬†with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using¬†[launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/)¬†but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use¬†[usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

I've paired the build with a purple and green Owlab Voice Mini, and MW Fright Night deskmat. \n\nThere's nothing better than combining multiple multiple purchases into one solid theme. Best of all both the board and macropad are wireless, which feels appropriate for a Halloween theme keeping everything untethered.\n\nThis is my 6th post that's part of #keebaweek. You can find the rest of my posts here, where I'm posting a keyboard every week for a whole year, 52 boards, with 6 down and 46 more to go.\n\nWeek 1: [Vertex Arc60](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1npcvs7/im_posting_a_picture_of_a_different_mechanical/)  \nWeek 2: [Lazydesigners Cloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1ntnjbu/im_posting_a_keyboard_a_week_for_the_next_year/)  \nWeek 3: [Sneakbox AVA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1nzmknb/im_posting_a_keeb_a_week_this_is_week_3_sneakbox/)  \nWeek 4: [Viktus Styrka](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1o5mc5w/week_4_of_posting_a_fresh_board_every_week_for/)  \nWeek 5: [Hola Mini](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1obmwjr/week_5_of_posting_a_fresh_board_every_week_a_year/)\n\nOf course, since I'm going through the trouble to document all of these boards after building such a large collection, I've been adding their finer details to a the [cataloging and sharing app Keebuilder](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/), this way I'll eventually have all of my builds and the parts used in a single place.

Currently, I have a crappy little monitor and an even crappier square monitor as a second monitor that has the video quality of a potato. I'm planning on upgrading to a nicer main monitor.\n\nFor my second monitor, I've wanted to keep it small--I only really use it for youtube or having wikis pulled up. A second huge horizontal monitor seems overkill, and honestly would take up way more room on my desk than I want. In my perfect world, I'd have a small vertical monitor. I want it to have 2k visuals, but at this point, I don't think that's anywhere near in the cards for me.\n\nI, however, cannot find a single monitor in the universe which is not a literal barely-functioning screen built for an office that will fit. To fit a monitor vertically, it would have to have a width of less than 18.5\", which I've discovered virtually does not exist. To keep it from being huge, I have searched for any slightly higher quality square/4:3 monitors, but I have discovered that those, too, simply do not exist.\n\n(For reference, [this ](https://www.amazon.com/SKitphrati-Inch-Monitor-Color-Correction/dp/B09KZP5J3S?crid=1195BAY9HNYJA&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kzeFVrja8FuGmR_heQoYfU6b3pF6FLdqsySrsnU64-CbWrREzhzBIDevyNoT6zOQwDgkhjuN2sKd_rqwHN-GZCnmeJ8Qry2wJZZfMCJN1dr5L40An8-Zm30YbEjPvs2XvPxjpv0YigIzDduvRAQHXDzGCuDOr6oOZVPKWjFHvfoLRiG7ePvLlaWncLi0G6LpGXnk16-iqQzE1ZYjU3wmDuof0VbTtbEjo13p79cU6D4.SGFZbOIp2vQr2vh_Uzg4gyuunoiFBZC8uUpx17HTn10&dib_tag=se&keywords=square%2Bmonitor&qid=1761575338&sprefix=square%2Bmonito%2Caps%2C251&sr=8-4&th=1)is what I have right now. it works about as well as you'd think)\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations, or am I doomed to suffer eternally at the hands of my no-space desk?",

    "title": "I officially give up on vrr freesync on gsync compatible monitor my ass (samsung s34j55x over display port) hours and hours troubleshooting with 0 results. I give up ive tried literally everything.",
    "selftext": "After exhausting every troubleshooting step to get VRR/FreeSync working on a G-Sync Compatible monitor, it's reasonable to stop when the issue persists despite correctly applying all recommended settings\n. In many cases, especially with non-certified \"G-Sync Compatible\" setups, minor stutters can be inherent due to imperfect hardware or software implementations. \nWhen to give up\nYou should consider stopping when you've done all the following and still see no improvement:\n\n    Verified all basic setup requirements, including using a DisplayPort cable and ensuring VRR is enabled in your monitor's OSD, NVIDIA Control Panel, and in-game settings.\n    Applied advanced optimization techniques, such as capping your in-game frame rate a few frames below your monitor's maximum refresh rate and setting V-Sync to \"On\" in the NVIDIA Control Panel but \"Off\" in-game.\n    Investigated other software issues, like disabling overlays (such as NVIDIA's or the Xbox Game Bar), checking for background applications, and ensuring you have the latest drivers installed.\n    Performed a clean re-installation of drivers using a tool like DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller).\n    Accepted that the problem might be hardware-related. For instance, some users on OLED monitors report persistent VRR flicker that is unfixable, as it may be tied to the display technology itself. \n\nWhat to do instead\nIf you've given up on getting a flawless VRR experience, here are some alternatives to improve your gameplay:\n1. Cap your frame rate\nThis is often the most effective and simplest solution for avoiding stuttering and screen tearing.\n\n    Disable all adaptive sync in your monitor settings and the NVIDIA Control Panel.\n    Cap your frame rate in-game or using a tool like RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS) to your monitor's refresh rate (e.g., cap at 144 FPS for a 144 Hz monitor).\n    Turn V-Sync on in the NVIDIA Control Panel and in-game. This will eliminate screen tearing and keep frame times stable, though it may introduce some input lag. \n\n2. Use Fast Sync or Enhanced Sync\nThese are GPU driver features designed to reduce tearing and input lag without forcing a fixed refresh rate.\n\n    Enable Fast Sync (NVIDIA) or Enhanced Sync (AMD) in your GPU control panel instead of standard V-Sync.\n    Ensure adaptive sync is off. This can be a good compromise for competitive games where low input lag is a priority. \n\n3. Accept screen tearing\nFor competitive gamers who prioritize the absolute lowest input lag above all else, the standard practice is to:\n\n    Disable adaptive sync and V-Sync entirely.\n    This will allow your GPU to render frames as fast as possible, but you will experience screen tearing when your frame rate is out of sync with your monitor. \n\nThe bottom line\nYou've likely done all you can. The \"G-Sync Compatible\" label on some FreeSync monitors is an imperfect standard, and it's not uncommon for users to experience issues that a certified G-Sync module would prevent. The time and effort spent troubleshooting can reach a point of diminishing returns. The best path forward is to find a configuration that provides the best balance of smoothness and low input lag for your specific use case, even if that means abandoning VRR altogether. ",

My main game is Overwatch 2 if that helps at all in giving me suggestions. I am NOT looking for OLED suggestions as they are far out of my budget. The refresh rate cannot be under 240 but I'm all for anything higher than that if it would still fit in my budget (which I doubt lol). I also ONLY want it to be 1440p. Nothing lower or higher than that resolution. If you have any more questions about my preferences feel free to ask. Thank you in advance for any help given!",

I had to do a lot of stuff for university including coding and all of that. I'm currently using a MacBook Air (15\"). I bought the 15 inch because I heard it's better if you have a larger screen it's not as bad for your eyes compared to a smaller 13\" screen. But I somehow feel like it's still bad for my eyes.\n\nAs far as I know, my laptop has a LCD screen. Would an OLED be better? I also use a lamp behind my laptop because I've heard (and read) that also helps against eye strain. If I got something like a 28 or 30 inch OLED screen, would that be a lot better? If that is the case, can someone recommend me a good external display that I can connect via USB C?\n\nI don't know if it's the stress (bc of exams and all the studying) or working on my laptop for 4-6 hours daily.

I hope y'all are well.\n\nI don't really have a lot of knowledge regarding monitors, but I would like to start to look for a new one.\n\nRight now I have the Odyssey G6 (since almost 2 years) for my PS5 Pro.\nIt is not bad but I got it because of the integrated OS and a good sale at that time. It definitely has some flaws.\n\nNow I really want to focus more on the performance, so I guess 4k, HDMI 2.1 and 120 hz should be a must have. The question now is should I go with a normal IPS, a Mini LED or OLED. First problem is, OLED is too expensive.\n\nI looked a little bit into RTINGS and when I compared their ratings for OLED and Mini LED, the OLED monitors had *much* higher ratings which surprised me, because I always see good feedback to Mini LEDs here in this subreddit.\nThen again OLED is too expensive. The only affordable monitor they recommended is the ASUS ROG Strix OLED XG27ACDNG for 689‚Ç¨. It got also a really nice review but it is not 4k, unfortunately.\n\nBecause of the price I was tending more to Mini LED, but after seeing the ratings on RTINGS and that big difference in comparison to OLED I am really not sure anymore.\n\nIs there anything I need to know? Anything specific I should look at?\n\nYour help will be much appreciated ü•≤",

I understand certain monitors offer KVM functionality, but given my setup, would it be possible to switch between Desktop and Laptop while getting all 3 of Video, Mouse And Keys at once? Given that the mouse and keyboard each are connected to a bluetooth receiver (USB-A). My understanding is, I would need to plug those receivers into the monitor, along with 2 other cables for Desktop/Laptop (DIsplayPort/HDMI).\n\n\n\nWould this even work, and is there any monitor with this many ports? One of my USB-C ports on the laptop is also taken up, which would mean that the one that connects from the monitor would have to charge/maintain the battery as well. ",

The paint was already chipping in several places, some bolts had damaged threads, it was nearly impossible to adjust the monitor even after trying all the settings from minimum to maximum, and the parts felt cheap, like the plastic cable management piece. When I tried adjusting the monitor, it actually bent the pivot joint. I was honestly shocked by the quality.\n\nOne of the arms even broke before I could mount a monitor on it. At $107, this is just embarrassing. What really gets me is that Ergotron sells the same arm for around $180. These should cost $20 at most. I have no idea how they get good reviews. Maybe they're fake?\n\nAnyway, moving on from that, I'd love to get some recommendations from you guys.\n\nI'm thinking of maybe getting a Desky Dual Spring Eco Monitor Arm or the HUANUO gas spring dual monitor mount.\n\nI'm building a standing desk setup for a new work from home job.

How many dimming zones is enough, apparently QA can pass a monitor with 5 dead pixels, does that matter or not? So many pop up Chinese manufacturers I don't recognize, what's good what's bad. And in all of it there doesn't seem to be a consensus on what's good. mini led vs oled vs qled vs qned.\n\nWhat response time is enough, how to read refresh rates spec, a monitor advertises 180hz....at its lowest resolution. At the highest resolution it's 60. So do I want resolution, refresh. Or both? Why is refresh non standard increments, 60, 75, 144, 180?

First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ‚Üî 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2√ó HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters.

[P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe‚Äôre currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

I can't help but think that's taking the piss.\n\n  \nI want a single monitor that I can do work on, play games such as Fallout4, occasionally watch movies on, in the future maybe a console, just an all-rounder.\n\nLooking at RTings and their idea of a budget 27\" monitor is ¬£350, when there are dozens below this level that presumably do a competent job\n\nIs there a good reason why I shouldn't look at or pickup something along these lines, which is where I currently stand? I've had numerous iiyama monitors in the past that were always very good, hence looking at them again.\n\n[https://www.cclonline.com/gcb3481wqsu-b1-iiyama-g-master-gcb3481wqsu-b1-34-inch-uwqhd-180hz-curved-va-gaming-monitor-465766/](https://www.cclonline.com/gcb3481wqsu-b1-iiyama-g-master-gcb3481wqsu-b1-34-inch-uwqhd-180hz-curved-va-gaming-monitor-465766/)",

I've seen videos, reviews and posts but it's quite a lot to take in. \n\n  \nMy main use will be for gaming and university (need some extra screen real estate) and the potential to pair up with a pc if I build one down the line. I don't really the best specs or anything but I hope that the monitor can be at least 120hz with good colours. Not too particular about viewing angles, ghosting or smearing, especially since I've always used the laptop display (60hz IPS) so I'm not too sure on what to expect.\n\n  \nI could potentially look for 27\" 1440p but I would like to stay with a 24\" due to a small desk, though I'm open to options.",

Currently, I have a crappy little monitor and an even crappier square monitor as a second monitor that has the video quality of a potato. I'm planning on upgrading to a nicer main monitor.\n\nFor my second monitor, I've wanted to keep it small--I only really use it for youtube or having wikis pulled up. A second huge horizontal monitor seems overkill, and honestly would take up way more room on my desk than I want. In my perfect world, I'd have a small vertical monitor. I want it to have 2k visuals, but at this point, I don't think that's anywhere near in the cards for me.\n\nI, however, cannot find a single monitor in the universe which is not a literal barely-functioning screen built for an office that will fit. To fit a monitor vertically, it would have to have a width of less than 18.5\", which I've discovered virtually does not exist. To keep it from being huge, I have searched for any slightly higher quality square/4:3 monitors, but I have discovered that those, too, simply do not exist.\n\n(For reference, [this ](https://www.amazon.com/SKitphrati-Inch-Monitor-Color-Correction/dp/B09KZP5J3S?crid=1195BAY9HNYJA&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kzeFVrja8FuGmR_heQoYfU6b3pF6FLdqsySrsnU64-CbWrREzhzBIDevyNoT6zOQwDgkhjuN2sKd_rqwHN-GZCnmeJ8Qry2wJZZfMCJN1dr5L40An8-Zm30YbEjPvs2XvPxjpv0YigIzDduvRAQHXDzGCuDOr6oOZVPKWjFHvfoLRiG7ePvLlaWncLi0G6LpGXnk16-iqQzE1ZYjU3wmDuof0VbTtbEjo13p79cU6D4.SGFZbOIp2vQr2vh_Uzg4gyuunoiFBZC8uUpx17HTn10&dib_tag=se&keywords=square%2Bmonitor&qid=1761575338&sprefix=square%2Bmonito%2Caps%2C251&sr=8-4&th=1)is what I have right now. it works about as well as you'd think)\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations, or am I doomed to suffer eternally at the hands of my no-space desk?",

    "selftext": "After exhausting every troubleshooting step to get VRR/FreeSync working on a G-Sync Compatible monitor, it's reasonable to stop when the issue persists despite correctly applying all recommended settings\n. In many cases, especially with non-certified \"G-Sync Compatible\" setups, minor stutters can be inherent due to imperfect hardware or software implementations. \nWhen to give up\nYou should consider stopping when you've done all the following and still see no improvement:\n\n    Verified all basic setup requirements, including using a DisplayPort cable and ensuring VRR is enabled in your monitor's OSD, NVIDIA Control Panel, and in-game settings.\n    Applied advanced optimization techniques, such as capping your in-game frame rate a few frames below your monitor's maximum refresh rate and setting V-Sync to \"On\" in the NVIDIA Control Panel but \"Off\" in-game.\n    Investigated other software issues, like disabling overlays (such as NVIDIA's or the Xbox Game Bar), checking for background applications, and ensuring you have the latest drivers installed.\n    Performed a clean re-installation of drivers using a tool like DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller).\n    Accepted that the problem might be hardware-related. For instance, some users on OLED monitors report persistent VRR flicker that is unfixable, as it may be tied to the display technology itself. \n\nWhat to do instead\nIf you've given up on getting a flawless VRR experience, here are some alternatives to improve your gameplay:\n1. Cap your frame rate\nThis is often the most effective and simplest solution for avoiding stuttering and screen tearing.\n\n    Disable all adaptive sync in your monitor settings and the NVIDIA Control Panel.\n    Cap your frame rate in-game or using a tool like RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS) to your monitor's refresh rate (e.g., cap at 144 FPS for a 144 Hz monitor).\n    Turn V-Sync on in the NVIDIA Control Panel and in-game. This will eliminate screen tearing and keep frame times stable, though it may introduce some input lag. \n\n2. Use Fast Sync or Enhanced Sync\nThese are GPU driver features designed to reduce tearing and input lag without forcing a fixed refresh rate.\n\n    Enable Fast Sync (NVIDIA) or Enhanced Sync (AMD) in your GPU control panel instead of standard V-Sync.\n    Ensure adaptive sync is off. This can be a good compromise for competitive games where low input lag is a priority. \n\n3. Accept screen tearing\nFor competitive gamers who prioritize the absolute lowest input lag above all else, the standard practice is to:\n\n    Disable adaptive sync and V-Sync entirely.\n    This will allow your GPU to render frames as fast as possible, but you will experience screen tearing when your frame rate is out of sync with your monitor. \n\nThe bottom line\nYou've likely done all you can. The \"G-Sync Compatible\" label on some FreeSync monitors is an imperfect standard, and it's not uncommon for users to experience issues that a certified G-Sync module would prevent. The time and effort spent troubleshooting can reach a point of diminishing returns. The best path forward is to find a configuration that provides the best balance of smoothness and low input lag for your specific use case, even if that means abandoning VRR altogether. ",

If it's exactly $300 or a few dollars over I am okay with that, just not at or past $350  preferably. I'm not very knowledgable in monitors but I would like it to have nice vibrant colors and come from well known brands like LG, Alienware, ASUS, Acer, etc. Doesn't have to be those specifically, just any kind of monitor brand that is well known and reliable. My main game is Overwatch 2 if that helps at all in giving me suggestions. I am NOT looking for OLED suggestions as they are far out of my budget. The refresh rate cannot be under 240 but I'm all for anything higher than that if it would still fit in my budget (which I doubt lol). I also ONLY want it to be 1440p. Nothing lower or higher than that resolution. If you have any more questions about my preferences feel free to ask. Thank you in advance for any help given!",

    "selftext": "Article: [MAX OLED](https://sid.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/msid.1610)\n\n  \nThe implications of this technology are huge !\n\n* Reduced pixel gap from 20Œºm to 8Œºm, which means 2.000 pixels per inch max density (for reference that would mean 55.000 x 31.000 resolution on a 31.5\" screen)\n* Lead time development cycle from 6 months to 6 weeks, which will make advancement pace of new OLED panels dramatically quicker\n* 47% lower power requirements on a 34\" screen, which means lower burn-in rates\n* Much higher brightness when/if needed (up to 2.000 nits luminance), which means proper HDR for anyone who wants it.\n* Larger (substrate) glasses in production lines, which means a lot more different designs in parallel so faster time to market products.\n* Less wasted area on the glass between panels (from 50cm to 23cm), which means more panels per glass, so cheaper panels.\n\nIf all of the above stand, then that MAX OLED could be a game changer for the industry.\n\n\n\nDid I got it right, or is it just too good to be true ?",

I don't really the best specs or anything but I hope that the monitor can be at least 120hz with good colours. Not too particular about viewing angles, ghosting or smearing, especially since I've always used the laptop display (60hz IPS) so I'm not too sure on what to expect.\n\n  \nI could potentially look for 27\" 1440p but I would like to stay with a 24\" due to a small desk, though I'm open to options.",

    "selftext": "First time in the market after 16 years. Replacing an Asus VS228 that was a hand-me-down.  But I'm overwhelmed in reading the reviews here, and Amazon and rtigns. I'll find a monitor I can afford, is available, and rtigns likes it, but reddit hates it. TN vs VS vs IPA. How many dimming zones is enough, apparently QA can pass a monitor with 5 dead pixels, does that matter or not? So many pop up Chinese manufacturers I don't recognize, what's good what's bad. And in all of it there doesn't seem to be a consensus on what's good. mini led vs oled vs qled vs qned.\n\nWhat response time is enough, how to read refresh rates spec, a monitor advertises 180hz....at its lowest resolution. At the highest resolution it's 60. So do I want resolution, refresh. Or both? Why is refresh non standard increments, 60, 75, 144, 180? I don't see the trend there. 1080, 2160, ratios and expanding binary base 2 at least makes some sense. \n\nPart of the problem is probably I'm ignoring the $600+ category. \nFor all my ranting I'm looking at.\n\nMSI MAG 27CQ6F\n\nMSI G274QPF\n\nAOC Q27G3XMN\n\nThank you for listening\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: thank everyone for helping.",

The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else. I would be perfectly happy with these as my open back and Aeon Closed RT as my closed back for the forseeable future.",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by Edifier or have any commercial interests in selling headphones. I just like music and love a good deal.\n\nThe Edifier WH950NB likely need no introduction; they launched for ‚Ç¨150 in Europe two years ago, have been around ‚Ç¨110 for a long time, and the white model has dipped to ‚Ç¨71 for a week a few months ago. I bought them on launch, and waited for a long time to form my opinion.\n\nI commute a few hours with them daily, and charge them once a week. I'm coming from a Hifiman Deva Pro, Sennheiser HD58X, and HD560S. I cannot overstate it: these headphones are phenomenal. Not \"good enough for Bluetooth headphones\", no, I often use them as my preferred listening experience over the others.\n\nHere's the secret: you get a (somewhat restricted) parametric EQ in the Edifier app. However, I created a preset from data (and my ears) that sounds so, so much better than the default tuning (see attached image for graphs):\n\n39Hz -3dB 2.0 (Optional)\n3000Hz -8dB 2.0\n3300Hz 3dB 2.0\n9000Hz 3dB 0.5\n\nIf you use UAPP on Android you can do automatic sample rate switching so you bypass Android's resampler on LDAC, and with some extra parametric EQ bands in UAPP you can improve the sound signature slightly more (I can add my preset in a comment if anyone is interested).\n\nOther than sound signature, these do everything you'd expect from a modern pair of BT headphones. There's passive and active 3.5mm support, a massive two-week battery, multiple ANC modes, multi-point Bluetooth 5.3, 96/32 LDAC, safe volume limiter, low latency mode, theater surround sound mode, and most importantly, an amazing travel case with a bunch of accessoires included (airplane splitter, usb-c cable, 3.5mm L-shape cable, protection pad for the folded cup).\n\nGenuinely wondering how no one is talking about these. Some of my family members, friends and colleagues bought one on my recommendation and they all think it's an amazing product. I only hear about the ‚Ç¨300+ products from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser etc.\n\nIs there anyone else that has these?",

    "selftext": "Here's a trimmed down version of my full review over on head-fi. You can find it [here](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/aune-n7.28592/reviews).\n\n# Aune N7 Review ‚Äî Mojo 2 Finds Its Match\n\nAfter upgrading to the Hifiman Arya Stealth, I wanted a proper Class A amp to bring out their full potential. I‚Äôve long used the Chord Mojo 2 as my main DAC/amp ‚Äî a brilliant device ‚Äî but I suspected pairing it with a pure Class A amp might unlock something new. Enter the **Aune N7**.\n\n# Build & Design\n\nCompact, solid, and purposeful ‚Äî the **N7**‚Äôs machined aluminum chassis with side heat fins looks serious and feels premium. The **volume knob** clicks smoothly but can skip if turned too fast. The **aluminum remote** feels fantastic, though its **volume buttons** could be better placed.  \nThe **display** is functional but small; no brightness control. As expected from a Class A amp, it runs warm ‚Äî hand-warmer warm, not egg-frying hot. The internal temperature stays around 45¬∞C even after long sessions.\n\n# Listening Setup\n\n**Chain:** Spotify Lossless ‚Üí WiiM Mini ‚Üí Mojo 2 ‚Üí Aune N7 ‚Üí Hifiman Arya Stealth (balanced out, high gain/high current).\n\n# Sound Impressions\n\n* **Steely Dan ‚Äì ‚ÄúAja‚Äù**: The N7 adds depth and weight, expanding the soundstage front-to-back. Bass gains texture; cymbals smooth out; the sax solo feels more alive. Some upper-mid sparkle is softened, but the trade-off is cohesion.\n* **Bill Evans Trio ‚Äì ‚ÄúSunday at the Village Vanguard‚Äù**: The sense of space and realism jumps. You don‚Äôt just hear LaFaro‚Äôs bass ‚Äî you feel it resonate. Evans‚Äô piano takes on body and warmth, and brushwork on the snare is wonderfully tactile.\n* **Snarky Puppy ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe Like It Here‚Äù**: A perfect showcase for the N7‚Äôs Class A dynamics. Everything stays tight and layered even in dense sections. You lose a touch of bite on transients, but gain richness and flow.\n* **Martha Argerich ‚Äì Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3**: The Mojo alone is precise but dry. Add the N7 and the sound breathes ‚Äî the piano has weight and the hall ambience comes alive.\n* **Entheogenic ‚Äì ‚ÄúDreamtime Physics‚Äù**: Electronica gains dimension and slam. Sub-bass digs deeper, highs shimmer smoothly, and the sound feels enveloping. The N7‚Äôs black background lets microdetails emerge effortlessly.\n\n# Tonal Character\n\nThe **N7** sits between **neutral and warm**, adding body without syrup. It turns the Mojo 2‚Äôs clinical precision into a more natural, organic presentation ‚Äî like switching from a microscope to a beautifully developed photo. Mids are dense, bass tight, highs extended yet smooth.\n\n# Noise & Power\n\nAbsolutely silent, even at high gain. The Arya Stealth reaches satisfying levels around 10‚Äì15/30 volume steps, leaving plenty of headroom. Rated at **6.5W @ 32Œ© balanced**, the N7 drives demanding planars effortlessly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe **Aune N7** is a **$399 Class A gem** ‚Äî compact, powerful, and genuinely musical. It transforms the Mojo 2 from analytical to alive, and makes the Arya Stealth sound more organic and fatigue-free.  \nIf you want long, engaging sessions and real Class A smoothness without spending big or cluttering your desk, this is the one. Mine‚Äôs staying put ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the best endorsement I can give.",

HE6se V2: less refined than Arya Stealth, very neutral and clinical, honky and boxy telephone-like sound (some may prefer this), very fast and dynamic.\n\n**With EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth (does not require EQ): still the best allrounder\n2. HE6se V2: very natural and smooth, great 3D sound with slightly less stage size than Arya Sealth, more weight and slam, excellent midrange, amazing separation\n3. Arya Stealth: fuller and richer but less emphasis than HE6 in many ways, slightly more balanced and smoother, good overall sound for a number of different use cases\n\nBoth the HE6se V2 (EQ'd) and HE1000 Stealth trade blows. It's definitely no slouch and ever so slightly prefer it over the HE1000 Stealth with certain genres such as rock and metal. For everything else including classical music, and videogame/movie OST's such as LOTR, Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 etc. the HE1000 Stealth is the overall winner, including Rap and Hip-Hop.\n\nThe most noticeable factors of the HE1000 Stealth over the Arya Stealth is note weight and staging. Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be ¬£3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

However, I do listen to lots of metal, and in some tracks, especially more chaotic with lots going on or just old and badly mixed - Aryas get a little bit harsh. Equalizer works great but it also kinda kills the beautiful detail on other songs, so it feels like a compromise. I can get used to switching equalizer settings but I can also afford another pair of headphones, that would be used for more casual listening or metal in general. \n\nBudget is flexible if it's worth it. I've been thinking about HD490Pro or HD660S2 (listened to both in a shop nearby, sounded nice and relaxed, but plastic build felt a bit cheap), maybe audeze LCD-2c (didn't get to listen to). It has to be different to be worth it, probably warmer, more forgiving, less harsh, but still a good hi-fi headphones. Any opinions are welcome!",

Regardless of what experts, reviews or anyone what is saying: what is your perfect pair of headphones? \n\nI used to have a pair of first generation Sennheiser Momentum but then due to working from home and getting a Jabra Evolve 75 SE from my company for calls I stopped using them and somehow lost them. \n\nRecently there came a point, though, where I got sick and tired from listening to music on them. I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring. At that moment I realised that they are perfect for me.",

    "title": "Quick comparison of Arya Stealth vs Edition XS for metal music",
    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it‚Äôs tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For ‚Äúheavier‚Äù music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that‚Äôs clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It‚Äôs an excellent headphone and if you don‚Äôt AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

    "title": "CCA CRA+: pure fun at a ridiculous price.",
    "selftext": "Hello Community!\n\nThis time it's the review of a low-cost product, but just because it costs little money doesn't mean we should forget about this range. In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO JA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**‚Ç¨13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 ‚Ç¨/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of ‚Ç¨30 than one of ‚Ç¨100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶let's start with the **package content:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† User manual\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the ‚Ç¨13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but‚Ä¶ the highs got easily out of control‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶ I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is‚Ä¶ somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child‚Äôs voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors‚Äô behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies‚Äô guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **‚Ç¨13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n¬†",

    "selftext": "Hope I got the right flair. Been Lurking here sometime. I‚Äôm About to make a job change to wfh and decided last week I‚Äôd get myself a Christmas present of noise cancellation, over the ear headphone to reduce those outside distractions while I‚Äôm trying to concentrate and focus. \n\n4 or 7 years or so ago the wife and I were goofing in a mall and visiting a crowded Apple Store for some reason. We live in a rural area and it‚Äôs two hours to the nearest so it‚Äôs a novel event and we wandered around checking out everything . Outside of some Bose about 15+ years ago, I‚Äôve never had occasion to be near NC Headphones. \n\nAnyway, I popped these on and EVERYTHING went dead silent. Best of all, my wife‚Äôs voice, right in front of my face trying to talk to me. Reminded me of that scene in, I think, Face Off with travolta and cage where someone drops headphones of soothing music on the little 4 yr old kid and then a huge gun battle breaks out. In that crazy, crowded, noisy store I heard nothing but soft cool jazz. I could see my wife‚Äôs lips moving but could hear a word and it was pure bliss. Not sure which model I had but they were like $500+ at the time. \n\nQ: Anything BETTER, or cheaper yet still super isolating and effective these days? How would I go about trying other models out? \n\nAlso appreciate advice on replacing ear pads, battery life, overall longevity of devices. ",

Yeah the highs are crisp, and I'll admit footsteps sound good, but I'm not getting the same emersive factor that I was getting from the nova pros. For example jumping out the plane in warzone the wind and engine sounded like it was actually up in your face if that makes sense, but with the Maxwells it just sounds thinned out. I have Atmos and the latest firmware installed and yes I tweaked with the EQ. Is there something I'm missing here?",

Especially the high-quality bass. But one thing that made me really happy as a customer is the accessories you get. When I bought much more expensive headphones, they don't treat you as good as FiiO. You get the regular 3.5mm cable with 6.35mm adapter but also a premium looking case and A BALANCED 4.4MM CABLE! Amazing headphones with amazing accessories. all for an amazing price. It's super convenient because I always wanted a balanced cable for my HD 600 and Edition XS but they are quite expensive. The fact that FiiO included them is just really nice. Now I can use them for my Edition XS without having to go out and look and spend money on them.\n\nThis really reminds me of how cheap smartphones gives you more than $1000 smartphones. You get a screen protector already applied, a free phone case included in the box and of course a should-be-mandatory charging brick. But for $1000 you don't even get a charger, like how is a dude gonna charge the damn phone???",

    "selftext": "I've had my Bose QC headphones for about a month now and I'm gonna be honest. I love them. I think they sound incredibly clear, they fit me perfectly, and have unbelievable ANC. The bass isnt muddied or undefined, its very rumbley, both male a female vocals are amazing, and treble isnt too overshadowed by the bass rumble. To be fair, this is the most expensive set of headphones I have ever had, but the ones I've tested in stores (sony WH-1000XM5, beats studio pro, sony WH-1000XM4, Anker space one, apple airpods max) are \\*OVERALL\\* worse for me. the sound isnt as good as some other headphones, but these headphones are so comfortable and the ANC is so powerful I dont really mind the audio quality loss. What do you guys think? ",

Love the flat bass response down to like 20hz, no roll off. I think the treble is perfect for me and I don‚Äôt think vocals are too far back in the mix at all.\n\nI‚Äôve had Sundara and Ananda in the past, as well as LCD 2C.\n\nWhile I never thought the Hifimans were overly piercing or too treble forward, I think the XV is definitely closer to the 2C in terms of overall tonality.\n\nWill definitely be keeping these.\n\nAre they better than 6xx? Out of the box yes but with EQ bass shelf on 6xx it gets much closer. They complement them well. 6xx is more of an intimate sound, XV is more spacious.\n\nKick drums and high hat sound perfect IMO. Love it\n\nOne weird thing I noticed....I always run through freq sweeps and tone generators every once in awhile to make sure there is no driver buzzing or other weird stuff going on.\n\nWith these Edition XV, there is no driver buzzing. However, when running the tone generator on squig.link I notice there is a tone within the tone at various frequencies. Not sure what that's about.\n\n300hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n1700hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n4000hz - left channel there are two seperate freqs coming through\n\n4900hz - right channel tone issue\n\nWould I have ever noticed just listening to music and watching videos? No. But now that I know it's there...\n\nI'll use for a couple weeks and see if it goes away.",

I have seen some really nice stands on vids by Resolve (a Focal stand) and GadgetryTech (forget the brand), but those are $250-$500, more than I want to pay for a stand. I found these HiFi For All stands (pictured) which are affordable, and solve the problem, but I would prefer one with a bit of a longer headband area (vs just wide depth-wise). Like the ones on Gadgetry‚Äôs vids - there is one that has a little knob that looks like it is for length adjustment that looks nice too, but I can‚Äôt find it on the net. (Third picture, from his Aune AR5000 review, sorry for blurriness).\n\nI am thinking there must be some hidden gems out there that are reasonable affordable, and available in the US sans tariff/import fees, preferably.",

I never had a issue with the XS comfort either, but the Arya's feel so far more comfortable.\n\nThe sound is such an upgrade. Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better. I was listening to my go to testing track Dreams by Fleetwood Mac and song just felt livelier. Stevie Nicks' voice had more character, the kick drums had presence and everything felt musical. The treble is spicy, but in not treble sensitive and actually prefer (call me crazy). The sound stage is bigger too!\n\nI am using these with my Ifi Neo Idsd that using the Burr Brown for reference and power these with ease. \n\nMy edition XS has been great for the last 3 years, but it's time to retire/sell them. I'll be listening to the Aryas and Fiio FT1 from now on, so they don't have any use. \n\nIn conclusion, these are brilliant and very happy I finally pulled the trigger.

Maybe it‚Äôs different for you.\n\nEdit 2: I repositioned the headphone a bit backwards. Seems to help with the ear pain. But I don‚Äôt have confidence to say the pads will provide longer session comfort.\n\nEdit 3: If you like the stock tuning. Get the stpad deluxe. Similar tuning but better clarity, quality and a bit more sound stage. Better comfort too. \n\nUnfortunately, same as the stock pads, stpad2 don't really improve the passive sound isolation.\n\nThe pads noticeably change the sound for the better. You can feel the wider sound stage or I should say the distance the pads created the second you put them on.\n\nLess bass but just right, stock bass was too much for me. Sub bass doesn‚Äôt seem to be impacted much.\n\nBetter mids IMO. more separation, details.\n\nTreble is definitely more, airy but not really harsh to me so far.\n\nFeels like the tuning is now neutral bright like IEMs but still has good amount of bass.

I would expect more at this price. honestly feels a bit plasticky and cheap. style also is very bland. doesn't look premium. Also, I personally don't like the swipe touch controls and I found them finicky.\n\nPX7 S3 - excellent. no leather. great styling and premium look. I enjoy the button controls better than the Sennheiser.\n\nPx8 S2 - excellent. has leather if you're concern about that. great styling and premium look even more than the px7. same button controls as the px7.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nHDB 630 - good but not great. with airplane noise it's about the same as the Px7. 630's were better with distinct noises like voices or background noise in a cafe or on a bus.\n\nPX7 S3 - good. not great. pretty good with airplane noise but distinct noises leak through quite a bit.\n\nPx8 S2 - just okay. worst of the bunch surprisingly. let in more airplane noise than the other two and distinct sounds leaked through quite a bit like the Px7\n\n**SQ:**\n\n**HDB 630:**\n\ntuning: pretty neutral\n\nspace and technicalities: space and staging is good. not great but all three are closed back so that's a natural limitation. Sennheiser is more relaxed and less \"fun\" but some audiophiles prefer that. both the Px7 and Px8 everything sounds closer and more \"fun\". good technicalities though. everything feels snappy and controlled. instrument separation is great.\n\nbass: well extended into sub bass and well controlled but is definitely not the star of the show. a bit thin sounding if you're not used to audiophile tuning. they can rumble though if you boost the bass with the EQ\n\nmids: maybe it's the audiophile tuning but it sounds a bit shouty to me. definitely not warm. lower mids seems thin while upper mids sound too forward. vocals sound a bit thin and snares sound a little sharp. actually a bit annoying to my ears but I tend to be treble sensitive.\n\ntreble: great as you would suspect from audiophile tuning. well extended and controlled but do weirdly get harsh for me. again, I'm a bit sensitive to treble so YMMV with that.\n\n**PX7 S3:**\n\ntuning: very bloated bass. maybe you'll like it if you're a basshead. good extension into sub bass but a bit less controlled than the px8 and 630 but still pretty good.\n\nspace and technicalities: worst of the bunch but still pretty good and pleasant to the ears. I only really notice they're worse after listening to the other headphones. both the px8 and 630 extract more detail and sound more spacious and 3D.\n\nbass: way bloated. strong and good extension into sub bass\n\nmids: my favorite here actually. sounds intimate and full. smooth and fun tuning. not shouty.\n\ntreble: my favorite also. sounds well extended and airy but not overly so. doesn't get sharp or shouty. maybe a tad rolled off and recessed compared to true audiophile tuning but to my ear they are close to just right. very pleasant sounding. the treble adds a bit of nice air and sparkle without getting annoying.\n\n**Px8 S2:**\n\ntuning: I would still consider these bass bloated but less so than the px7. mids feel a tiny bit more recessed than the px7 but more present and forward than the 630. more treble presence than the px7. maybe about the same as the 630 but sounds less shouty.\n\nspace and technicalities: very good here. better 3D space and detail than the px7. bass is tighter and transients feels slightly snappier than the px7. similar to the 630 in terms of space and detail but again, the B&Ws feel closer and more \"fun\".\n\nbass: my favorite bass of the three. still sounds bloated to me but less so than the px7. more balanced and controlled than the px7. definitely way more power here than the 630 without EQing.\n\nmids: very good. tiny bit recessed compared to the px7. sounds smooth and balanced.\n\ntreble: very good here. well controlled and extended but still sounds smooth. about the same presence as the 630 but sounds more balanced to me.\n\n**what I'm keeping?**\n\nto my surprise, I think I'm keeping the Px7 S3. I'm hoping the band loosens a bit. the ANC is pretty good especially with airplane noise. the B&W styling is very attractive. mids and highs are great and tuned to my liking. sense of space and technicalities are still very good and pleasant to listen to. and for now, I have the low bass down 3.5 and mid bass down 2.0 and they sound less bloated.",

Should i order 2 just incase? Lol but im guessing the unopened earbuds are still having they battery drained by just existing anyways?",

    "title": "3 year Review of the Audeze LCD-X (Post 2021 Version)",
    "selftext": "To start off, these are such incredible cans. It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

While I think the ATs beat them in imaging, it isn‚Äôt that big of a difference. They are less comfortable, don‚Äôt have any bass, build quality feels cheap. \n\nI tried them with BF6 and while it was immersive, the moment I put on the 490s after these the difference was apparent. The velour pads work well with my glasses and are way more comfortable than the audio technicas. \n\nI also tried listening to some music, namely BRAT because I love the production on that album and these lacked any sort of punch. I have SONY MDR MV1s coming in tomorrow, will see how they hold up against what I already have. Looking for something more V shaped and lush compared to the 560s sound signature and I‚Äôve heard that the mv1s fit that description well. If they don‚Äôt I might return the 490s, R70xas and MV1s and skipping mid fi completely and move to some Hi Fi offerings like Clears/Meze 109 pro/FT7 (because I want to try planars). Any other suggestions are welcome, looking for open backs with a big soundstage as well as a bass boost. Not too concerned with neutrality. ",

    "selftext": "**TLDR:** Good sound, good customization, bad comfort, finnicky connectivity, high price. Audeze Maxwell + Momentum 4 for $50 more (can be less if you're cool with open box) do more things better.\n\n**The positives:**\n\n* **One of the best ever sounding closed backs**, definitely the best I've heard with ANC (vs Bathys, XM5/XM6, Momentum 4, QC Ultra, Airpods Max), competes with or beats many wired closed backs. I think they fall just short of Audeze Maxwell with some EQ adjustments, but those headphones are very close to my tastes out of the box so YMMV.\n* Pairs great tuning with anatomy measurements to normalize low end performance between different users and re-seating.\n* **PEQ** to dial in to your tastes\n* **Low latency** (matched my monitor's input lag near identically in gaming mode by my perception))and high res Bluetooth connections with the dongle. I think Sennheiser are getting close to or even beating that 30ms latency in the low latency dongle mode\n* **The sound with the dongle is excellent**, even in the low latency mode\n* Solid all around functionality as a portable ANC headphone\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n* **Comfort is not great**. Fairly shallow pads that compress easily cause heat and pressure on the pinna, and I don't have big ears. They (and Momentum 4) also have an odd cup angle that requires you to rotate the headband forward which is sub-optimal. For comparison, I find the Bathys comfier in the pads but slightly less comfy in the headband. I hate the XM5/XM6 comfort-wise, 630 are an improvement. APM are comfier and QC Ultra are much much comfier.\n* The WC Freeze pads for Momentum 4 fit and are way comfier but hurt the seal a lot (which makes ANC and sound both much worse) making those pads a complete no-go IMO.\n* No 2.4GHz on the dongle\n* Finicky pairing and touch controls. Same issues as Momentum 4.\n* **No ability to use the mic + get full sound quality at the same time**\n* No options for a boom mic\n* **Boring looking and no color options,** and they are a bit too thick in the cups to look normal vs other ANC.\n* **Expensive**: **You can get a pair of Momentum 4 + an Audeze Maxwell for $50 more**, and less than the price of the HDB 630 if you are willing to do refurbs/open box. Maxwell is comfier to me (weight doesn't bother me, capra strap improves even more) and sounds better + has the boom mic and low latency via 2.4ghz. Momentum 4 sounds pretty good with the built in graphic EQ and not that much worse than HDB 630 if you use another app for PEQ.\n\n**Deeper Sound Breakdown**: These headphones were very quickly determined to be not worth the money for me, so these impressions are not my most thorough. As with all sound impressions, YMMV.\n\n* **Tuning**\n   * They are **a bit mid-bass focused** for me, sounding a bit bloated in the low end. Luckily the blending into the mids is very clean and not boomy. The extension is good, but the midbass focus also reduces how apparent this is\n   * **The mids are very nice.** Perhaps a bit lacking in energy, but this can be fixed with a peak filter most likely somewhere between 1-3k. I often find 2-2.5k helps with this a lot.\n   * **They are very natural sounding in timbre**. This is the one thing that they solidly beat the Momentum 4 at even with the M4 dialed in with the in-app EQ.\n   * **The treble very even and pleasant albeit** maybe a tad too relaxed for me.\n* **Technicalities**\n   * **Bass texture is lacking.** Even with a filter reigning in the midbass, they lacked the grit and texture in the low-end that I really look for in a headphone\n   * **Treble is a bit oversmoothed, leading to a perceived lack of resolution**. This may actually be affecting the bass texture situation.\n   * **They aren't that punchy or energetic**. The midbass focus and a bit of relaxed 1-3k lead to a bit of dullness. Kick drums don't impact as nicely as I'd like, and higher voices don't come through as strongly as I think they should.\n   * **They are a well-controlled but not super 'fast'.** Especially with the bass reduced, they do give the impression of not being sloppy or slow, but they aren't super quick in terms of attack or decay.\n   * **A note about imaging/soundstage**: I am a speaker guy first and foremost. I don't get any impression of verticality or layering from any headphones unless the music is mastered specifically with headphones and spaciousness in mind. I find that production to be very rare. The things I do notice are imaging and distance. **The imaging is good; t**his is mostly just down to consistent channel matching across the FR. **Spaciousness is exactly what you'd expect.** They aren't completely inside my head, but they give no impression the sound is coming from a distance outside of the headphone. This is typical for me for closed backs.\n* **EQ Suggestions:**\n   * Peak filter around 120hz, q\\~1, -1-3db to get rid of the bass bloat\n   * If you are more of a bass roll-off fan, do a bass shelf with 2-5db reduction.\n   * Find the area between 1-3k that increasing with a q filter of \\~1 by 1-3db gives you more energy and punch.\n   * Find any over-emphasis in the low treble, 3-7k and reduce that if needed.\n   * See if you have any aggressive peaks above 5k, and reduce them with smaller q value filters\n   * Add a treble shelf to boost detail if needed.\n\n**Summary:** excellent sound especially with PEQ, mediocre comfort, boring design that looks a bit bulky on head, good latency and sound via dongle, no boom mic, sound is bad when using mic, and pricey vs a dedicated ANC + dedicated gaming headphone. I like the Maxwell + Momentum 4 enough to make it a no-go for me. **But if the mic situation and comfort are good for you, they're very hard to beat as an all-around single solution.**",

Thank you.\n\nI am someone who was originally aiming towards the Creative Aurvana Ace 3s, but love the sound profile of the Jlabs too much (I use the Knowles Sound Profile with a bump in the bass) and thought why not upgrade to the headphones instead of the TWS to compensate for the difference in soundstage and generational gap as the Epic Lab Edition TWS are a few years dated now compared to the Creatives.",

Instead, they delivered a flimsy build, muddy audio, and abysmal customer service, making this purchase a complete letdown.\nDurability: Shockingly Fragile\nThe website claims the H1H survived 1.8m drops onto hard floors, but this is a blatant lie. My headphones‚Äô headband snapped in two after a mere 0.4m drop onto a soft carpeted floor. For a premium product, this fragility is outrageous. The 308g weight also made them uncomfortable for extended wear, and the satin finish attracted fingerprints, further cheapening the experience.\n\nCustomer Service: Insulting Response,\n\nWhen I contacted Heavys about the broken headband, their response was slow and unhelpful. After days of generic emails, they offered a 25% discount on another purchase. Why would I buy a faulty product again? This dismissive attitude left me feeling cheated and ignored.\n\nSound and Features: Substandard,\n\nThe sound was bass-heavy and muddy, burying vocals and guitars in tracks like Iron Maiden‚Äôs Run to the Hills. The app‚Äôs EQ barely helped, and the soundstage felt cramped. The ‚ÄúHell Blocker‚Äù noise cancellation was ineffective against basic background noise, and clunky buttons made adjustments a hassle.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Heavys H1H are a massive disappointment. A fragile build, false durability claims, poor sound, and insulting customer service make these headphones a waste of money. Metal fans, steer clear and invest in something reliable.",

The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else. I would be perfectly happy with these as my open back and Aeon Closed RT as my closed back for the forseeable future.",

    "selftext": "Here's a trimmed down version of my full review over on head-fi. You can find it [here](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/aune-n7.28592/reviews).\n\n# Aune N7 Review ‚Äî Mojo 2 Finds Its Match\n\nAfter upgrading to the Hifiman Arya Stealth, I wanted a proper Class A amp to bring out their full potential. I‚Äôve long used the Chord Mojo 2 as my main DAC/amp ‚Äî a brilliant device ‚Äî but I suspected pairing it with a pure Class A amp might unlock something new. Enter the **Aune N7**.\n\n# Build & Design\n\nCompact, solid, and purposeful ‚Äî the **N7**‚Äôs machined aluminum chassis with side heat fins looks serious and feels premium. The **volume knob** clicks smoothly but can skip if turned too fast. The **aluminum remote** feels fantastic, though its **volume buttons** could be better placed.  \nThe **display** is functional but small; no brightness control. As expected from a Class A amp, it runs warm ‚Äî hand-warmer warm, not egg-frying hot. The internal temperature stays around 45¬∞C even after long sessions.\n\n# Listening Setup\n\n**Chain:** Spotify Lossless ‚Üí WiiM Mini ‚Üí Mojo 2 ‚Üí Aune N7 ‚Üí Hifiman Arya Stealth (balanced out, high gain/high current).\n\n# Sound Impressions\n\n* **Steely Dan ‚Äì ‚ÄúAja‚Äù**: The N7 adds depth and weight, expanding the soundstage front-to-back. Bass gains texture; cymbals smooth out; the sax solo feels more alive. Some upper-mid sparkle is softened, but the trade-off is cohesion.\n* **Bill Evans Trio ‚Äì ‚ÄúSunday at the Village Vanguard‚Äù**: The sense of space and realism jumps. You don‚Äôt just hear LaFaro‚Äôs bass ‚Äî you feel it resonate. Evans‚Äô piano takes on body and warmth, and brushwork on the snare is wonderfully tactile.\n* **Snarky Puppy ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe Like It Here‚Äù**: A perfect showcase for the N7‚Äôs Class A dynamics. Everything stays tight and layered even in dense sections. You lose a touch of bite on transients, but gain richness and flow.\n* **Martha Argerich ‚Äì Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3**: The Mojo alone is precise but dry. Add the N7 and the sound breathes ‚Äî the piano has weight and the hall ambience comes alive.\n* **Entheogenic ‚Äì ‚ÄúDreamtime Physics‚Äù**: Electronica gains dimension and slam. Sub-bass digs deeper, highs shimmer smoothly, and the sound feels enveloping. The N7‚Äôs black background lets microdetails emerge effortlessly.\n\n# Tonal Character\n\nThe **N7** sits between **neutral and warm**, adding body without syrup. It turns the Mojo 2‚Äôs clinical precision into a more natural, organic presentation ‚Äî like switching from a microscope to a beautifully developed photo. Mids are dense, bass tight, highs extended yet smooth.\n\n# Noise & Power\n\nAbsolutely silent, even at high gain. The Arya Stealth reaches satisfying levels around 10‚Äì15/30 volume steps, leaving plenty of headroom. Rated at **6.5W @ 32Œ© balanced**, the N7 drives demanding planars effortlessly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe **Aune N7** is a **$399 Class A gem** ‚Äî compact, powerful, and genuinely musical. It transforms the Mojo 2 from analytical to alive, and makes the Arya Stealth sound more organic and fatigue-free.  \nIf you want long, engaging sessions and real Class A smoothness without spending big or cluttering your desk, this is the one. Mine‚Äôs staying put ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the best endorsement I can give.",

    "selftext": "**Without EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth: best all rounder, widest soundstage, great imaging, superior separation, hefty bass\n2. Arya Stealth: sterile, thin sounding, decent bass\n3. HE6se V2: less refined than Arya Stealth, very neutral and clinical, honky and boxy telephone-like sound (some may prefer this), very fast and dynamic.\n\n**With EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth (does not require EQ): still the best allrounder\n2. HE6se V2: very natural and smooth, great 3D sound with slightly less stage size than Arya Sealth, more weight and slam, excellent midrange, amazing separation\n3. Arya Stealth: fuller and richer but less emphasis than HE6 in many ways, slightly more balanced and smoother, good overall sound for a number of different use cases\n\nBoth the HE6se V2 (EQ'd) and HE1000 Stealth trade blows. It's definitely no slouch and ever so slightly prefer it over the HE1000 Stealth with certain genres such as rock and metal. For everything else including classical music, and videogame/movie OST's such as LOTR, Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 etc. the HE1000 Stealth is the overall winner, including Rap and Hip-Hop.\n\nThe most noticeable factors of the HE1000 Stealth over the Arya Stealth is note weight and staging. Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be ¬£3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by Edifier or have any commercial interests in selling headphones. I just like music and love a good deal.\n\nThe Edifier WH950NB likely need no introduction; they launched for ‚Ç¨150 in Europe two years ago, have been around ‚Ç¨110 for a long time, and the white model has dipped to ‚Ç¨71 for a week a few months ago. I bought them on launch, and waited for a long time to form my opinion.\n\nI commute a few hours with them daily, and charge them once a week. I'm coming from a Hifiman Deva Pro, Sennheiser HD58X, and HD560S. I cannot overstate it: these headphones are phenomenal. Not \"good enough for Bluetooth headphones\", no, I often use them as my preferred listening experience over the others.\n\nHere's the secret: you get a (somewhat restricted) parametric EQ in the Edifier app. However, I created a preset from data (and my ears) that sounds so, so much better than the default tuning (see attached image for graphs):\n\n39Hz -3dB 2.0 (Optional)\n3000Hz -8dB 2.0\n3300Hz 3dB 2.0\n9000Hz 3dB 0.5\n\nIf you use UAPP on Android you can do automatic sample rate switching so you bypass Android's resampler on LDAC, and with some extra parametric EQ bands in UAPP you can improve the sound signature slightly more (I can add my preset in a comment if anyone is interested).\n\nOther than sound signature, these do everything you'd expect from a modern pair of BT headphones. There's passive and active 3.5mm support, a massive two-week battery, multiple ANC modes, multi-point Bluetooth 5.3, 96/32 LDAC, safe volume limiter, low latency mode, theater surround sound mode, and most importantly, an amazing travel case with a bunch of accessoires included (airplane splitter, usb-c cable, 3.5mm L-shape cable, protection pad for the folded cup).\n\nGenuinely wondering how no one is talking about these. Some of my family members, friends and colleagues bought one on my recommendation and they all think it's an amazing product. I only hear about the ‚Ç¨300+ products from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser etc.\n\nIs there anyone else that has these?",

    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it‚Äôs tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For ‚Äúheavier‚Äù music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that‚Äôs clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It‚Äôs an excellent headphone and if you don‚Äôt AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

Regardless of what experts, reviews or anyone what is saying: what is your perfect pair of headphones? \n\nI used to have a pair of first generation Sennheiser Momentum but then due to working from home and getting a Jabra Evolve 75 SE from my company for calls I stopped using them and somehow lost them. \n\nRecently there came a point, though, where I got sick and tired from listening to music on them. I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring. At that moment I realised that they are perfect for me.",

    "selftext": "Hello Community!\n\nThis time it's the review of a low-cost product, but just because it costs little money doesn't mean we should forget about this range. In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO JA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**‚Ç¨13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 ‚Ç¨/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of ‚Ç¨30 than one of ‚Ç¨100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶let's start with the **package content:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† User manual\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the ‚Ç¨13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but‚Ä¶ the highs got easily out of control‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶ I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is‚Ä¶ somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child‚Äôs voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors‚Äô behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies‚Äô guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **‚Ç¨13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n¬†",

However, I do listen to lots of metal, and in some tracks, especially more chaotic with lots going on or just old and badly mixed - Aryas get a little bit harsh. Equalizer works great but it also kinda kills the beautiful detail on other songs, so it feels like a compromise. I can get used to switching equalizer settings but I can also afford another pair of headphones, that would be used for more casual listening or metal in general. \n\nBudget is flexible if it's worth it. I've been thinking about HD490Pro or HD660S2 (listened to both in a shop nearby, sounded nice and relaxed, but plastic build felt a bit cheap), maybe audeze LCD-2c (didn't get to listen to). It has to be different to be worth it, probably warmer, more forgiving, less harsh, but still a good hi-fi headphones. Any opinions are welcome!",

I never had a issue with the XS comfort either, but the Arya's feel so far more comfortable.\n\nThe sound is such an upgrade. Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better. I was listening to my go to testing track Dreams by Fleetwood Mac and song just felt livelier. Stevie Nicks' voice had more character, the kick drums had presence and everything felt musical. The treble is spicy, but in not treble sensitive and actually prefer (call me crazy). The sound stage is bigger too!\n\nI am using these with my Ifi Neo Idsd that using the Burr Brown for reference and power these with ease. \n\nMy edition XS has been great for the last 3 years, but it's time to retire/sell them. I'll be listening to the Aryas and Fiio FT1 from now on, so they don't have any use. \n\nIn conclusion, these are brilliant and very happy I finally pulled the trigger.

The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else. I would be perfectly happy with these as my open back and Aeon Closed RT as my closed back for the forseeable future.",

    "selftext": "Here's a trimmed down version of my full review over on head-fi. You can find it [here](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/aune-n7.28592/reviews).\n\n# Aune N7 Review ‚Äî Mojo 2 Finds Its Match\n\nAfter upgrading to the Hifiman Arya Stealth, I wanted a proper Class A amp to bring out their full potential. I‚Äôve long used the Chord Mojo 2 as my main DAC/amp ‚Äî a brilliant device ‚Äî but I suspected pairing it with a pure Class A amp might unlock something new. Enter the **Aune N7**.\n\n# Build & Design\n\nCompact, solid, and purposeful ‚Äî the **N7**‚Äôs machined aluminum chassis with side heat fins looks serious and feels premium. The **volume knob** clicks smoothly but can skip if turned too fast. The **aluminum remote** feels fantastic, though its **volume buttons** could be better placed.  \nThe **display** is functional but small; no brightness control. As expected from a Class A amp, it runs warm ‚Äî hand-warmer warm, not egg-frying hot. The internal temperature stays around 45¬∞C even after long sessions.\n\n# Listening Setup\n\n**Chain:** Spotify Lossless ‚Üí WiiM Mini ‚Üí Mojo 2 ‚Üí Aune N7 ‚Üí Hifiman Arya Stealth (balanced out, high gain/high current).\n\n# Sound Impressions\n\n* **Steely Dan ‚Äì ‚ÄúAja‚Äù**: The N7 adds depth and weight, expanding the soundstage front-to-back. Bass gains texture; cymbals smooth out; the sax solo feels more alive. Some upper-mid sparkle is softened, but the trade-off is cohesion.\n* **Bill Evans Trio ‚Äì ‚ÄúSunday at the Village Vanguard‚Äù**: The sense of space and realism jumps. You don‚Äôt just hear LaFaro‚Äôs bass ‚Äî you feel it resonate. Evans‚Äô piano takes on body and warmth, and brushwork on the snare is wonderfully tactile.\n* **Snarky Puppy ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe Like It Here‚Äù**: A perfect showcase for the N7‚Äôs Class A dynamics. Everything stays tight and layered even in dense sections. You lose a touch of bite on transients, but gain richness and flow.\n* **Martha Argerich ‚Äì Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3**: The Mojo alone is precise but dry. Add the N7 and the sound breathes ‚Äî the piano has weight and the hall ambience comes alive.\n* **Entheogenic ‚Äì ‚ÄúDreamtime Physics‚Äù**: Electronica gains dimension and slam. Sub-bass digs deeper, highs shimmer smoothly, and the sound feels enveloping. The N7‚Äôs black background lets microdetails emerge effortlessly.\n\n# Tonal Character\n\nThe **N7** sits between **neutral and warm**, adding body without syrup. It turns the Mojo 2‚Äôs clinical precision into a more natural, organic presentation ‚Äî like switching from a microscope to a beautifully developed photo. Mids are dense, bass tight, highs extended yet smooth.\n\n# Noise & Power\n\nAbsolutely silent, even at high gain. The Arya Stealth reaches satisfying levels around 10‚Äì15/30 volume steps, leaving plenty of headroom. Rated at **6.5W @ 32Œ© balanced**, the N7 drives demanding planars effortlessly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe **Aune N7** is a **$399 Class A gem** ‚Äî compact, powerful, and genuinely musical. It transforms the Mojo 2 from analytical to alive, and makes the Arya Stealth sound more organic and fatigue-free.  \nIf you want long, engaging sessions and real Class A smoothness without spending big or cluttering your desk, this is the one. Mine‚Äôs staying put ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the best endorsement I can give.",

HE6se V2: less refined than Arya Stealth, very neutral and clinical, honky and boxy telephone-like sound (some may prefer this), very fast and dynamic.\n\n**With EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth (does not require EQ): still the best allrounder\n2. HE6se V2: very natural and smooth, great 3D sound with slightly less stage size than Arya Sealth, more weight and slam, excellent midrange, amazing separation\n3. Arya Stealth: fuller and richer but less emphasis than HE6 in many ways, slightly more balanced and smoother, good overall sound for a number of different use cases\n\nBoth the HE6se V2 (EQ'd) and HE1000 Stealth trade blows. It's definitely no slouch and ever so slightly prefer it over the HE1000 Stealth with certain genres such as rock and metal. For everything else including classical music, and videogame/movie OST's such as LOTR, Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 etc. the HE1000 Stealth is the overall winner, including Rap and Hip-Hop.\n\nThe most noticeable factors of the HE1000 Stealth over the Arya Stealth is note weight and staging. Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be ¬£3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by Edifier or have any commercial interests in selling headphones. I just like music and love a good deal.\n\nThe Edifier WH950NB likely need no introduction; they launched for ‚Ç¨150 in Europe two years ago, have been around ‚Ç¨110 for a long time, and the white model has dipped to ‚Ç¨71 for a week a few months ago. I bought them on launch, and waited for a long time to form my opinion.\n\nI commute a few hours with them daily, and charge them once a week. I'm coming from a Hifiman Deva Pro, Sennheiser HD58X, and HD560S. I cannot overstate it: these headphones are phenomenal. Not \"good enough for Bluetooth headphones\", no, I often use them as my preferred listening experience over the others.\n\nHere's the secret: you get a (somewhat restricted) parametric EQ in the Edifier app. However, I created a preset from data (and my ears) that sounds so, so much better than the default tuning (see attached image for graphs):\n\n39Hz -3dB 2.0 (Optional)\n3000Hz -8dB 2.0\n3300Hz 3dB 2.0\n9000Hz 3dB 0.5\n\nIf you use UAPP on Android you can do automatic sample rate switching so you bypass Android's resampler on LDAC, and with some extra parametric EQ bands in UAPP you can improve the sound signature slightly more (I can add my preset in a comment if anyone is interested).\n\nOther than sound signature, these do everything you'd expect from a modern pair of BT headphones. There's passive and active 3.5mm support, a massive two-week battery, multiple ANC modes, multi-point Bluetooth 5.3, 96/32 LDAC, safe volume limiter, low latency mode, theater surround sound mode, and most importantly, an amazing travel case with a bunch of accessoires included (airplane splitter, usb-c cable, 3.5mm L-shape cable, protection pad for the folded cup).\n\nGenuinely wondering how no one is talking about these. Some of my family members, friends and colleagues bought one on my recommendation and they all think it's an amazing product. I only hear about the ‚Ç¨300+ products from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser etc.\n\nIs there anyone else that has these?",

    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it‚Äôs tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For ‚Äúheavier‚Äù music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that‚Äôs clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It‚Äôs an excellent headphone and if you don‚Äôt AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

Regardless of what experts, reviews or anyone what is saying: what is your perfect pair of headphones? \n\nI used to have a pair of first generation Sennheiser Momentum but then due to working from home and getting a Jabra Evolve 75 SE from my company for calls I stopped using them and somehow lost them. \n\nRecently there came a point, though, where I got sick and tired from listening to music on them. I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring. At that moment I realised that they are perfect for me.",

Fun little game, very much a 6/10, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad by any means- just a bit derivative and repetitive. But sometimes that‚Äôs just what you need.  \n\nalso being able to play this up scaled is so nice. \n\nNext up is the Nicktoons Unite series. ",

    "selftext": "Just wanted to share and check in that I'm not missing anything. \n\nBiggest issue I've had that prevents me from using SD is the fact that I feel like story driven games just aren't as enjoyable. The resolution is worse than my 1440P on ultra, even when I try to stream from PC it looks dark and pixelated. This makes it really hard to enjoy that type of game and I essentially feel like I'm missing out by playing something like Indiana Jones on my deck instead of my 27\" 1440P monitor which is much more immersive.\n\nAt the same time, I find myself wanting to play more on the SD because after working 8 hours from home on my computer, sitting there and gaming another 4+ is getting old and it's affecting me because it becomes a room of depression if that makes sense. When I play cartoon games, 2d, platformers, etc. on deck it feels great and I wish I was able to game on the couch or even in bed where I have more windows/light, etc. just makes it feel better after spending all day working in a small dark room.\n\nAnyone else experience the same and find any solutions?",

I had to reinstall them to get them working, which they did but the install took a while so I decided to reformat the SD card to get it working correctly. The formatting just didn't work, just sat there. Tried a few methods mentioned on some posts about formatting but wouldn't work. Formatted the card on my PC - quick format works find but full format again just doesnt do anything - sitting at 0% after 30 minutes. According to my PC the card is fine, no errors. After a quick format I used it on my PC and am installing Steam Games on there as it seems more reliable than the Steam Deck - but its taking a very long time to install - for context its taken over an hour to do 10gb of a 40gb install, where as installing on a different disk took about 10 mins for 10gb. \n\n  \nI know this is a crossover into general tech support, but I've seen a few people mention SD card problems so wondering it might be an issues with the Steam Deck and if there anyway to fix the card?\n\n  \nThanks",

No covers, no kickstand... just our friend without extras!\n\nNote: photos of screens suck big time. The moir√© effect ruins it. But it's better than nothing",

However, it being wired is a pain in the ass. \n\nI have bought a longer usb c cable that goes from my dock all the way to my gaming chair. Now, this is a prime example of first world problems, but the cable is annoying as hell. I tried to get as flexible a cable as I could, but it is just a mess when I have it stored behind my Steam Deck.\n\nLooking into using a wireless controller seems way more complicated than I thought it would be. Would a wireless Power A Xbox Series controller work ok?

It's portable, but hardly pocketable, so I'm never really going to take it anywhere unless I'm properly traveling, and even then I have far more portable options. What that boils down to is that if a game is also available on Switch (or Switch 2 which I don't have yet), then I'd rather just get it there. I can also use that on the couch and it's way easier to take with me. My Switch Lite fits in my pocket. \n\nIf a game isn't also available on another portable console, then I also have a PC and an Xbox at home, and I know that not everyone has all that, but I can play a lot of those games also on the couch on a big TV with a nice controller. That's not to mention that a lot of my steam library are games that either don't have controller support or are better with keyboard and mouse.\n\nWhat am I actually supposed to play on the Steam Deck that isn't a better experience on a different device? It's too big to be portable, and it struggles to compete with other options in the house. We originally only got one because my son was interested in it, and he never touches it, he just uses his ipad. \n\nI want to want to use it, I just don't see the use case unless you don't own anything else, and in that case, that's not much of an endorsement to \"just get a steam deck\". \n\nHelp me see the light.

    "selftext": "I normally play on PC (preferred system) but am traveling internationally for the next couple of weeks so have had to resort to Steam Deck. It's an amazing piece of hardware but has always struggled with Helldivers 2.\n\nFinally decided to do some research into actual verified solutions/tweaks that would at least get the game at a locked 40 FPS without hitching/stuttering.\n\nI made four changes:\n\n1. Set graphics preset to the \"Steam Deck ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è\" profile\n\n2. Set Sharpness to .70 (this is personal preference, doesn't affect performance)\n\n3. Boot into the BIOS (don't panic, it's like three clicks in the BIOS GUI), change VRAM pre-allocated amount from the default of 1GB to 2GB. Some posts say do 4GB but I wanted to test results with a slight bump first.\n\n4. Set the IN GAME FPS limit to 40. Do not use the Steam side-panel FPS restriction option \n\nPower off deck fully. Hold volume up button and tap power button. When you see the logo appear on the screen, release the volume up button.\n\nBottom right of screen, click that option.\n\nIn the menu, Advanced --> whatever option (VMU? CMU?) is defaulted to 1GB and only has four options (512MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB), set that to 2GB.\n\nSave and exit. Wait ~30 seconds for Deck to reboot (screen will be black for a bit). \n\nHelldivers feels WAY more smooth and frame pacing is no longer all over the place.\n\nI've only run difficulties one through five after this tweak, but it's solidly consistent in the 32-40 FPS range, while not looking like complete shit. I categorize this as \"very playable.\"\n\nHope this helps fellow Deck Divers\n\n------------\n\nYou do **not** need to edit config files, use FSR, change from the native resolution of 1280x800, or any of the other in-depth changes you'll see in other posts when googling this issue.\n\nUse the Steam Deck graphics preset and bump up the VRAM allocation and boom you have a playable game",

Recently a thumbstick started to fail, so I changed them both, I assumed the problem would go away after that but it did not, so I think it is safe to assume it is not a hardware related issue.  \n\nGoogled a bunch but cannot find anyone complaining about a similar behavior.  Wouldn't be a big deal being the L3 key works normally (in game) but the \"listen\" command is super useful and is functionally useless now.

A lot of PC players are used to play without a gamepad and we didn‚Äôt fully realize that.\n\nWe‚Äôre currently working on keyboard & mouse controls, and it works fine. So you can still play our upcoming game on PC, but it would feel way better on Steamdeck:\n\n* Controls are tailored to play smoothly on a pad and to make full use of all the Steamdeck buttons,\n* UI is designed to be readable on a small screen,\n* There‚Äôs a quick game mode, you decide how long you want it to be,\n* If you feel peaceful, you can be friends with other factions,\n* You can do some actions, then pause the game and continue later,\n* Characters are so cute that you want to keep them in your pocket üíô\n\nThe game is perfect to be played on-the-go.  \nWe hope Steamdeck users will enjoy our alien game üòÖ\n\nNB: Sorry the poor video and sound quality!",

I had to reinstall them to get them working, which they did but the install took a while so I decided to reformat the SD card to get it working correctly. The formatting just didn't work, just sat there. Tried a few methods mentioned on some posts about formatting but wouldn't work. Formatted the card on my PC - quick format works find but full format again just doesnt do anything - sitting at 0% after 30 minutes. According to my PC the card is fine, no errors. After a quick format I used it on my PC and am installing Steam Games on there as it seems more reliable than the Steam Deck - but its taking a very long time to install - for context its taken over an hour to do 10gb of a 40gb install, where as installing on a different disk took about 10 mins for 10gb. \n\n  \nI know this is a crossover into general tech support, but I've seen a few people mention SD card problems so wondering it might be an issues with the Steam Deck and if there anyway to fix the card?\n\n  \nThanks",

However, this is something I'd like to do to suit my use-case scenario.\n\nI've set up a couple autohotkey scripts / exes on my desktop, one for when I start a session of streaming to deck (kills my IM programs, sets my universal game volume virtual device to full volume), and one for when I finish (open the IM programs again, minimise them and steam to tray, revert audio device, put computer to sleep). That's fine. Problem is that in order to trigger them, I'd have to boot up steam link or moonlight, start and end of every session, run them from the app list, close.\n\nWhat I'd ideally like is to have these two nestled away in my 'Game Streaming'  category, so they're just 2-3 taps away, and .sh files don't get bumped to the top of the home menu when used.",

The resolution is worse than my 1440P on ultra, even when I try to stream from PC it looks dark and pixelated. This makes it really hard to enjoy that type of game and I essentially feel like I'm missing out by playing something like Indiana Jones on my deck instead of my 27\" 1440P monitor which is much more immersive.\n\nAt the same time, I find myself wanting to play more on the SD because after working 8 hours from home on my computer, sitting there and gaming another 4+ is getting old and it's affecting me because it becomes a room of depression if that makes sense. When I play cartoon games, 2d, platformers, etc. on deck it feels great and I wish I was able to game on the couch or even in bed where I have more windows/light, etc. just makes it feel better after spending all day working in a small dark room.\n\nAnyone else experience the same and find any solutions?",

A lot of PC players are used to play without a gamepad and we didn‚Äôt fully realize that.\n\nWe‚Äôre currently working on keyboard & mouse controls, and it works fine. So you can still play our upcoming game on PC, but it would feel way better on Steamdeck:\n\n* Controls are tailored to play smoothly on a pad and to make full use of all the Steamdeck buttons,\n* UI is designed to be readable on a small screen,\n* There‚Äôs a quick game mode, you decide how long you want it to be,\n* If you feel peaceful, you can be friends with other factions,\n* You can do some actions, then pause the game and continue later,\n* Characters are so cute that you want to keep them in your pocket üíô\n\nThe game is perfect to be played on-the-go.  \nWe hope Steamdeck users will enjoy our alien game üòÖ\n\nNB: Sorry the poor video and sound quality!",

However, this is something I'd like to do to suit my use-case scenario.\n\nI've set up a couple autohotkey scripts / exes on my desktop, one for when I start a session of streaming to deck (kills my IM programs, sets my universal game volume virtual device to full volume), and one for when I finish (open the IM programs again, minimise them and steam to tray, revert audio device, put computer to sleep). That's fine. Problem is that in order to trigger them, I'd have to boot up steam link or moonlight, start and end of every session, run them from the app list, close.\n\nWhat I'd ideally like is to have these two nestled away in my 'Game Streaming'  category, so they're just 2-3 taps away, and .sh files don't get bumped to the top of the home menu when used.",

I had to reinstall them to get them working, which they did but the install took a while so I decided to reformat the SD card to get it working correctly. The formatting just didn't work, just sat there. Tried a few methods mentioned on some posts about formatting but wouldn't work. Formatted the card on my PC - quick format works find but full format again just doesnt do anything - sitting at 0% after 30 minutes. According to my PC the card is fine, no errors. After a quick format I used it on my PC and am installing Steam Games on there as it seems more reliable than the Steam Deck - but its taking a very long time to install - for context its taken over an hour to do 10gb of a 40gb install, where as installing on a different disk took about 10 mins for 10gb. \n\n  \nI know this is a crossover into general tech support, but I've seen a few people mention SD card problems so wondering it might be an issues with the Steam Deck and if there anyway to fix the card?\n\n  \nThanks",

I am trying to figure out a way to use the smart devices as much as possible without making them exposed to or used by renters/PM folks etc.  My inventory so far is \n\n* a dozen wifi smart switches (but not all of the house) that seem Tuya\n* 4 ring cameras, \n* a smart TV (LG ThinQ), \n* a tuya smart lock\n* An Arris Cable Modem\n* A bunch of older 5G networking gear \n* a few oddballs like a water level monitor for a cistern.  \n\nNone of it seems to be connected (although I suspect the PM firm can access the Ring cameras).\n\nI'm looking for some thoughts on a low impact, high reliability solution to leverage as much as I can.  At the moment, I am planning to tie all the switches and ring cameras into Smart Life and Ring which will add them to my Alexa account.  It seems like I am missing some opportunity to use the TV as a hub for al this.  (No interest in a Home Assistant solution).\n\n  \nThoughts?",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5). Tripp Lite Metered PDU, 15A, 13 Outlets (5-15R), 120V, 5-15P, 100-127V Input, 15 ft. Cord, 1U Rack-Mount Power, (PDUMH15)\n\n6). NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe‚Äôre still in development and not selling anything yet ‚Äî just trying to see if there‚Äôs real value in this idea.

Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

Basically if we have negative air pressure in the room I risk burning up my oven control units very quickly. As you can imagine this is expensive both to repair and both in time. Air pressure can be controlled with the facilitation of a make up air system and multiple exhaust fans that can be individually switched on and off. \n\nIdeally I‚Äôd have sensor that goes off and sounds an audible alarm if say there is too much negative air pressure so that the bakers can adjust things.\n\nDoes something like this exist ready to go out of the box?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

I can get them to all come back if I powercycle all of my Echos at the same time, but they start dropping off again within an hour.\n\nI'm at a dead-end as far as troubleshooting.  I have tried powercycling, reconfiguring, connecting things in a different order, etc.  I have factory reset everything in the entire system multiple times.  As I previously mentioned, all firmware is up to date.  If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob ü§∑\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on¬†https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5.

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0‚Äì360, S and V are 0‚Äì1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01‚Ä¶81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests ‚Äúindex‚Äù is the zero-based LED position inside the device‚Äôs internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` ‚Üí hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 ‚Ä¶` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the ‚Äúapply‚Äù byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 ‚Ä¶`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n‚Ä¢ Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n‚Ä¢ Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n‚Ä¢ Working zone writes: `‚Ä¶ 81 01` to `‚Ä¶ 81 04`  \n‚Ä¢ Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n‚Ä¢ Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n‚Ä¢ Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

(and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

    "selftext": "Hey there! I'm looking to add some automation to my home for the very first time. I am looking to start by purchasing a smart lock for my front door. I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring‚ÄîI want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative‚Ä¶ let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark ‚Äútreeluminator decoration‚Äù. It‚Äôs this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I‚Äôve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we‚Äôve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I‚Äôd like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t‚Ä¢\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn‚Äôt require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I‚Äôve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send ‚Äújammed‚Äù alerts\n\nHere‚Äôs what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it‚Äôs happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%¬± after 90 days. The Thread one‚Äôs down to about 60 %. I‚Äôm guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock‚Äôs spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA‚Äôs network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA‚Äôs core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA‚Äôs event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the ‚Äúold‚Äù one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it‚Äôs been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).\n\nEdit: Appreciate all the feedback! A bunch of you mentioned trying the newer Z-Wave LR hardware, so I picked up one of the fingerprint-enabled models to test. U-Bolt is my choice.\n\n Install was painless, popped right into HA with Z-Wave JS, no hub weirdness.\n\n I‚Äôve tried plenty of Wi-Fi locks over the years, but this one finally feels like the right mix of DIY-friendly and ‚Äúset it and forget it.‚Äù Will report back in a month once it‚Äôs had more runtime.",

I like to sleep cold, but enjoy getting up with a moderately warm room. \n\nI already have a fan that turns off about 30 minutes to an hour before I wake up, which is nice. The thing I'm looking for is a way for my door to be closed as well. (I don't have a window, the door leads to a small balcony). I noticed there are a number of products that allow for automation when it comes to allowing pets through or manual opening and closing, but none that include a timer. Am I just being blind and missing them or do they not exist? \n\nIf anyone has a solution, I would love to hear it! (Sleeping in a warm room is not an option)",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5). Tripp Lite Metered PDU, 15A, 13 Outlets (5-15R), 120V, 5-15P, 100-127V Input, 15 ft. Cord, 1U Rack-Mount Power, (PDUMH15)\n\n6). NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, we are working on something and I'd like to know your honest opinion, sort of a sense-check.\n\nIt's a tool (or rather a suite of tools) that guides you step by step through the process of building and maintaining a smart home. A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe‚Äôre still in development and not selling anything yet ‚Äî just trying to see if there‚Äôs real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

I had 2 ikea LED strips with only a physical button to change colours, a similar solution would work.

But i'm not sure if I still need any app to install it. \n\nIkea has a solution similar to what I seek, but only with Rolling curtains/roller blinds (idk the English word, those hanging ones). \n\nAqara Curtain Driver E1 seems to offer a similar solution, but once again it's smart and I don't see it explicitly stated that it can be used without the smart stuff\n\nWhen I google I see options ranging from 6 euro Aliexpress ones on shady websites to solutions which seem trustworthy but are 200Eur each, wich is too much as I need four. \n\nCan anyone point me towards products which might be worth checking into?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

The thing I'm looking for is a way for my door to be closed as well. (I don't have a window, the door leads to a small balcony). I noticed there are a number of products that allow for automation when it comes to allowing pets through or manual opening and closing, but none that include a timer.

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5). Tripp Lite Metered PDU, 15A, 13 Outlets (5-15R), 120V, 5-15P, 100-127V Input, 15 ft. Cord, 1U Rack-Mount Power, (PDUMH15)\n\n6). NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

I am trying to figure out a way to use the smart devices as much as possible without making them exposed to or used by renters/PM folks etc.  My inventory so far is \n\n* a dozen wifi smart switches (but not all of the house) that seem Tuya\n* 4 ring cameras, \n* a smart TV (LG ThinQ), \n* a tuya smart lock\n* An Arris Cable Modem\n* A bunch of older 5G networking gear \n* a few oddballs like a water level monitor for a cistern.  \n\nNone of it seems to be connected (although I suspect the PM firm can access the Ring cameras).\n\nI'm looking for some thoughts on a low impact, high reliability solution to leverage as much as I can.  At the moment, I am planning to tie all the switches and ring cameras into Smart Life and Ring which will add them to my Alexa account.  It seems like I am missing some opportunity to use the TV as a hub for al this.  (No interest in a Home Assistant solution).\n\n  \nThoughts?",

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe‚Äôre still in development and not selling anything yet ‚Äî just trying to see if there‚Äôs real value in this idea.

All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

    "selftext": "Hello! Our house which we moved into a few months ago has a strange beeping sound. It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

Now, Google wants nearly ¬£300 for renewal  and it‚Äôs being rebranded as Google Home Premium Advanced.\n\nThat price jump feels insane for what I‚Äôm getting.\n\nI‚Äôve recently moved all my automations to Home Assistant and absolutely love it. It‚Äôs made me realize how much control I could have outside Google‚Äôs ecosystem.\n\nSo, my question:\nWhat‚Äôs the best way to move away from Google/Nest entirely while keeping similar functionality (especially for cameras and hubs)?\n\nIs there a good local/NAS-based alternative for video storage and smart home integration?\n\nAnyone here migrated from Nest to Home Assistant-compatible cameras successfully?\n\nAnd what‚Äôs the best use for the Nest Hubs if I start de-Googling everything?\n\n\nAppreciate any tips or migration stories from folks who‚Äôve done this , I‚Äôm happy to tinker, but I don‚Äôt want to lose reliability or ease of use for the family.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I‚Äôve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox ‚Äî mostly because it supports Matter and doesn‚Äôt need a separate hub.\n\nHere‚Äôs my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn‚Äôt connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz ‚Äî after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It‚Äôs surprisingly consistent ‚Äî every morning when I‚Äôm still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a ‚ÄúMovie mode‚Äù scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they‚Äôre showing around 85%. I‚Äôll update if that changes, but it looks like they‚Äôll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly ‚Äî not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went ‚Äúno response‚Äù üòÖ.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding ‚Äî but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt‚Äôs not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected ‚Äî thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn‚Äôt super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn‚Äôt bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that‚Äôs fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything ‚Äî I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn‚Äôt drop connection every other day.\nIf you‚Äôre building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I‚Äôll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

    "selftext": "I have a smart IR blaster which is connected to the wifi so I can connect it to my phone. The built in on and off and other basic commands like temperature work fine. But when I tried to use the DIY function where I physically put the remote up to the IR blaster so it can read the signal outputted by the remote so that it can read that signal and out put it itself, it doesn't work but when I tried the remote on the ac itself it does work. AC doesnt support a wifi function so it won't work with the TCL home app. The Smart IR blaster is an OEM tuya remote. \n\nI first tried to consult this to an AI model but it said that remotes often transmit a long code containing temperature, modes and whatnot and that the IR receiver of the blaster might not be picking that long code and only picking up a quick bit of it. Then it just said to bring this up to a community so here I am. I think my problem might not be with TCL but that I'm trying to use an AC",

Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I‚Äôve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a better alternative.\n\n**What I‚Äôm looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4‚Äì5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you‚Äôve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn‚Äôt a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance ‚Äî and if you‚Äôve built something like this, I‚Äôd love to see your setup!",

I have Starlink, so I have very very few issues with connectivity.   \nDo I need a hub for my set up? or if I do need one, what's a decent basic hub to control 5 or 6 bulbs in a small (1400sq ft) house? I don't want a voice activated system like Alexa or Google Home. Something more simple. What are your suggestions? I'm not trying to create some massive home network here.    \nOverthinking here!  ",

(Some things are more comokicated but with enough time i can handle it) So i would love to have the visualisation over HA. \n\nBUT; What would be the best/easiest way to set up the rest/electricity? This should be more of an easy/straight forward thing. Should run when we move into the house. I can set the HA things later. \n\nI Thought KNX would be the way, but there are still a few disadvantages:\n\n- I cant program ETS by myself\n- I would like to have the main functions to work with KNX (heating, shading, lights, main door lock, garage door) to be controled over switches AND something like a Shelly walldisplay which should have all functions.\n\nSo my questions is:\n-Is it possible to control shading, main door lock etc. also over HA? (Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system. (Where I can do the normal stuff already when moving into the house)\n\nThanks for your advice!\n",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

    "selftext": "For home usage. I'd like to store a decent amount of video from the cameras (I have no idea how storage for the ones without subscription works but maybe a month of storage with motion detection if that works well plus the option of transferring the video to other storage). \n\nI would want three cameras to surround the house, plus a doorbell where I can talk to people outside (this could also be one of the three cameras with a speaker/microphone especially if the doorbells are prone to getting stolen). Motion activated security lights \n\nI'd also like some window sensors (they needn't necessarily be part of the same system) that work with windows with narrow frames that open outwards.\n\nSome kind of siren on things would be a bonus if they are activated in a smart way.\n\nI don't really have the option of wired connection, so it would all have to be WiFi. \n\nWhat do I need to achieve all this?",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

    "selftext": "Hello! Our house which we moved into a few months ago has a strange beeping sound. It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "title": "Been testing Bringnox smart shades with HomeKit for 3 weeks ‚Äî here‚Äôs what I learned",
    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I‚Äôve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox ‚Äî mostly because it supports Matter and doesn‚Äôt need a separate hub.\n\nHere‚Äôs my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn‚Äôt connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz ‚Äî after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It‚Äôs surprisingly consistent ‚Äî every morning when I‚Äôm still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a ‚ÄúMovie mode‚Äù scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they‚Äôre showing around 85%. I‚Äôll update if that changes, but it looks like they‚Äôll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly ‚Äî not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went ‚Äúno response‚Äù üòÖ.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding ‚Äî but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt‚Äôs not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected ‚Äî thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn‚Äôt super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn‚Äôt bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that‚Äôs fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything ‚Äî I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn‚Äôt drop connection every other day.\nIf you‚Äôre building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I‚Äôll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

    "selftext": "I love the idea of the Zooz ZEN34, but it's only available in white and all my switches and outlets are brown (Leviton brown).  \n\nHas anyone ever seen an add-on battery-powered smart switch that has color options including brown?   \n\nI use Home Assistant (Green hub) with the Z-Wave ZWA-2 antenna, and everything in my home is Z-Wave so that's what I need.\n\n#If it doesn't exist:\nI would be totally open to a brown regularly wired Z-Wave switch that has the feature to control a second device with, perhaps, a double click or maybe it has a second button on it or something?\n\nThe situation - i have a small room with one light switch.  I want to add to the wallplate a second switch that activates a lighted frame device I have in the room (for fun).  I've got it connected to a Z-wave smart outlet plug thing.  But I need a way to control it from the wall.  Hope that makes sense.\n\nThank you!",

All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

    "selftext": "Hi, I unplugged my EIGHTREE Smart Socket 2 days ago and plugged it back in today. Unfortunately, it won't come back online since being plugged in. Eben manually pressing the button also does nothing. I tried to reset it, which also didn't work. I also plugged in another, identical EIGHTREE Smart Socket just today, and it was fully functional again immediately. I noticed that when I plug in the one that is still working, the button briefly lights up red. Nothing happens with the \"broken\" one. I think it is the ET2 model, but there are pictures. Is it really broken, or am I being stupid?\n\n",

Also sorry if this is very similar to another post, I looked through a few but they were either inconclusive or a different situation to my own.\n\nMy computer is connected to the wifi network, but says it has no internet. I checked two other devices (phone and laptop), both work just fine on the same WiFi network so I‚Äôm assuming the issue is with the computer. I‚Äôve connected to the wifi on the computer before, so this is a new issue. The only cause I can think of is I had to switch my PC off with the power button rather than the usual shutdown menu, but I‚Äôve done this before without these issues occurring. I did some brief research and most sites recommend restarting the router, but I don‚Äôt have access to mine (university wifi, not my own), so I can‚Äôt really do this. Again, the problem isn‚Äôt affecting any other devices, so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll be the cause anyway, but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nSome more things I feel may be of note:\n- I have been using an ethernet cable for the past week or so and without any issues\n- I‚Äôve tried connecting to two other networks, one of which being my phone‚Äôs hotspot, and both had the same issue of connecting but no internet\n- I‚Äôve tried restarting the device at least thrice now, twice within fairly quick succession and once this morning after having it switched off overnight. None of the restarts fixed anything\n- The device in question is a desktop computer, windows 11. Not sure what specs may be needed to troubleshoot, so I‚Äôll update with some if asked for them.",

As if it needs to buffer for 30-60 seconds before playing the video like normal. \n\n2: Flicker the video and continue playing it, but without any audio coming from the earbuds or phone speaker.\n\nI've found each problem has a very temporary solution (it'll have one of the issues again within 3-5 videos after)\n\nIf it freezes I can flick the phone into airplane mode disconnecting internet and Bluetooth for a sec, then turn it off and things work again. If it flickers I can tap the Bluetooth icon and just hit the disconnect and reconnect on my earbuds real quick and it comes back. \n\nContext:\n\nI've turned it off and back on. Both phone and drained the raycon battery.\n\nI've cleared YouTube cache/storage, and uninstalled and reinstalled. \n\nI've cleared other phone memory in settings, and flicked several setting options on or off in the Bluetooth settings and the raycons on the phone.\n\nI haven't been able to find my old Bluetooth earbuds yet to see if they have the same issue. \n\nHowever, I have tried my earbuds with a tablet and I do not have the same issue\n\nI'm concerned that one of the next steps is a factory reset, but before I try it I figured I should ask and see if anyone has some hidden gem of info.

    "selftext": "I was playing a game on my desktop a few days ago when my screen went dark, the fans stopped spinning, but the power light still stayed on. Without really thinking (I thought it crashed or something, my laptop has crashed in similar ways), I clicked the power button, and the fans all started spinning again, only to hear a pop and to see my GPU to light on fire. I of course immediately switched off the outlet it was plugged into but the damage to the GPU was already done. There are 3 large round capacitors on the top of my card by the ports which are burnt. Here is a picture showing 2 of the capacitors (the third is behind the very burnt one): [https://imgur.com/a/aAq4Cmm](https://imgur.com/a/aAq4Cmm)\n\nI have since removed the GPU and booted the PC using the IGPU and everything seems fine (looking back that was probably quite stupid and could have caused another fire). No data seems to be lost, all my RAM, SSDs, fans, etc seem to still be working. When I initially turned the monitor on I thought it was done for, as it appeared to have a lot of broken pixels only displaying blue, but even with that just turning it on and off again seemed to fix it. So, while nothing seems to be wrong now, I am still incredibly nervous about it and don't think I want to replace the GPU until I have a better idea of what happened. \n\n\n\nWhile I am sad the GPU is probably done for, my main concern now is for the rest of my computer. I am nervous that something else my be wrong with it given that the failure literally caused it to light on fire. So this is leaving me with a few questions:\n\n* What signs of damage should I be looking for? \n* Are there any components I should be particularly concerned about?\n* How can I try and find the source of the problem?\n\nMy first thought is that maybe it was a power surge or that the PSU is faulty, and that if I were to buy a new GPU or even just plan on keeping the PC I should repalce it? I am not sure what else could have caused it to fail in such a way. I have heard of capacitors popping on cards when they get old enough, but I have never heard or seen anything like this.\n\n\n\nThe GPU in question was a Gigabyte GTX 1650 Super, that I bought refurbished 4 years ago(along with everything else I bought new), but having found some old pictures of the box the GPU seems to have been originally bought almost 6 years ago. here is also a link to gigabyte's page on the card: [https://www.gigabyte.com/ie/Graphics-Card/GV-N165SWF2OC-4GD](https://www.gigabyte.com/ie/Graphics-Card/GV-N165SWF2OC-4GD)\n\nSome of the other specs include:\n\n* CPU: Ryzen 5 5600G\n* Mobo: Gigabyte B550M DS3H\n* RAM: 2x 8GB g.skill ripjaws\n* PSU: Gigabyte P650B",

    "selftext": "Windows 11. Been freeing up space for things I don't play anymore recently. I have some questions on how should I go about uninstalling The Sims 4 and Electronic Arts app (that I got through Steam instead of the website). I have no plans on returning to the software.\n\n1) Do I unlink EA from Steam before I start doing anything else? Or will this break something?\n\n2) Do I need to do things in a specific order (e.g. uninstall TS4 through Steam/Control Panel first then EA app)?\n\n3) Does it also delete the CC (custom content) in the folder or will I have to do that manually?\n\nI've already searched for troubleshooting answers but to no avail. It is also against the respective subreddits' rules to post asking about this.\n\nThank you to anyone who is able to give me advice! (Preferably not looking for uninstallers by the way.)",

It can happen within minutes, usually around half an hour, and 5% of the time, no problems for hours.\n\nThe sound starts crackling in my headphones, fps drops to 10-20 without GPU and CPU usage or heat spikes, and then the game crashes (it can happen for example with a pixelated game as well, with CPU/GPU usage around 15-20%, so nothing demanding). Immediately restarting, the issue either disappears for a while or comes back in minutes, as detailed above. Other than that, my rig seems to run some games with sub optimal performance, regardless their requirements (others have no issues with the same or lesser specs running it medium/high, I cannot maintain 30 FPS in absolute low settings)\n\nRan DXDIAG, ramtest, cpu test, gpu tests, monitoring heat, voltage, anything unusual - so far, nothing. Tried different bios setups, ram timings, freqs. Might be important, that I do not want to and never did OC anything. All drivers checked, up to date, windows up to date as well, even did a clean windows install to test it out.\n\nOperating System: Windows 11 Pro 64-bit (10.0, Build 26100) (26100.ge\\_release.240331-1435) \n\nMB: Asus rog strix b450-f gaming\n\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor (12 CPUs), \\~3.6GHz\n\nMemory: 32768MB RAM (Corsair¬†VENGEANCE LPX 16GB (4x8GB) DDR4 3200MHz CMK16GX4M2B3200C16)\n\nPSU: Enermax Platimax 600W\n\nDirectX Version: DirectX 12\n\nIt would be much appreciated to get some tips, what could be the possible issue.

The only \"error code\" i get is my monitor displaying \"DP not detected\" before it black screens. Restarting my PC will fix this, but attempting to load the game again will cause the same issue. Sent my PC into a PC repair store, so all the connections internally were tested and wires replaced. I replaced the display port cable, and have changed which port it is connected to. I had a friend more well versused in tech completely reset my PC (wipe everything and reinstall windows), it seemed to be working fine (benchmark didnt crash my pc anymore and i was able to play hollow knight for 30 mins). Tried to play peak a couple hours later and loaded into the lobby just fine, but when loading the game PC black screened and same error message came up (\"DP not detected\"). Was able to load back in but was getting about 3fps with all the visual settings as low as possible. Checked and the crash had caused my display adapted to not enable on startup. Have to manually disable/enable them to get them to work. Sometimes have to completely reinstall them because they will enable but not run. I managed to play minecraft for about 6 hours recently, and my pc only crashed once (in the middle of the game, didnt open anything or change anything my screen just went black). Just tested and once re-enabled i was able to log into peak (offline mode) just fine once re-enabling my drivers. Any idea of what could be causing this random crashing or how i could fix it.\n\n\\*\\*edit: with crashing i specifically mean my monitor blackscreening, it seems as though my actual pc is still running, and once i could still hear audio even with the black screen.\n\nI apologise if this is messy or formatted badly, im just unbelievably at a loss of what to do.",

    "selftext": "Hi, so today I was using my Wacom Intuos S BT Tablet as usual. I wanted to look for reference in Chrome so I hovered with my pen over the search bar and started typing with the laptop keyboard (I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5). Suddenly, as soon as I pressed the M-key, the window was closed. And when I pressed E, an explorer window popped up. This was the case with the rest of my keyboard, not even Ctrl+C or Ctrl+V works. \n\nI restarted the Laptop, everything went back to normal. But as soon as I use the tablet, my keyboard wont behave. What could have caused this, and how can I deactivate these \"settings\"?\n\nThanks!\n\nAdditional info:\nI connected through Bluetooth, didnt try with cable yet. The keyboard wont work with folder names, search on a browser, alltogether typing, but i was able to open Windows+R and type \"control\" to get to the Access Center and disable every checkbox in \"Make the Keyboard easier to Use\". Then, the keyboard would also start to work normally again, though temporarily. As soon as my Pen touches the tablet, the keyboard is in shambles.",

    "selftext": "My laptop is 4 years old and now is starting to have some troubles with the vents. Specifically 1 doesn't even start, the other spins loudly and sometimes stop. I stopped gaming but still used it since I need it for University, but I replaced the thermal paste.\nFor clarification, my Laptop is a Pavilion HP 15-ec0016 (I couldn't for the life of me find manuals about it, I just found a video explaining how to dismantle it, just a video explaining how to replace fans)\n\n\nI removed battery, fans and heatsink (the connectors were really problematic since the wouldn't come off. I applied a bit of pressure while being careful to not damage the motherboard), applied the thermal paste (I had to be careful since It was attached to the motherboard with...tape? I didn't want to risk it) and rescrewed everything. The PC didn't start without the charger attached, but once I plugged it in it started.\n\nMy temp didn't vary much, but I noticed it sky rocketed after a while (idle temp was mostly 45 C, after a while it went to 65 only to cool down), going from 45 to 60, then cooling down and finally sky rocketing to 70. I turned it off to not damage it further.\n\nI'm currently waiting for one of the replacement fans to come, but could I have possibly done something wrong? Did I permanently damage one of the components? I also dusted off with a clean brush all the dust from the heat sink, but still what makes me tremble is the skyrocketing temperature from 60 to 70 degree in a few seconds. Also, I used to control the temperature Speed fan.",

    "selftext": "So I finished this build around 2 weeks ago now. My specs are -\n\n* **Motherboard:** Colorful CVN B850M\n* **CPU:** Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n* **GPU:** ASROCK Steel Legend 9070 XT\n* **RAM:** 2 x 16GB Acer Predator Vesta II 6000 MT/s CL30\n* **PSU:** Gigabyte UD850GM PG5 850W PSU\n* **Storage:**\n   * WD Blue SN570 250GB (carried over from my previous PC)\n   * WDC WD10EZEX-22MFCA0,(old 1 TB HDD, also carried over)\n\nWithin a couple of days I saw multiple crashes when I was in-game with error codes like `IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL` and `KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED`.\n\nI searched around then and figured the problem was with my RAM as memtest86 was constantly failing at Test 8 with the EXPO profile enabled. I reduced the frequency to 5800 MT/s and things seemed to be running fine for a while.\n\nA few days after that I added a new SSD to this build - MSI M470 Pro Gen 4 2 TB.\n\nAfter installing this, I soon saw a BSoD again and thought it must be the RAM again so I reduced the speed further to 5600. Again things seemed fine for a while until I saw multiple crashes in a row. I then got fed up and returned my RAM and got these new ones - 2 x 16GB TeamGroup T-Force Delta 7200 MT/s CL34 (tuned to run at 6000 MT/s at CL30 using Buildzoid's timings).\n\nDidn't see any crash after that for a few days until today - when it crashed 3 times again. The error code once was `CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED`, I couldn't note what it was 1 other time, and 1 time it just froze and I had to manually shut down the PC. On top of this, it seems like Windows is unable to write a dump file either for this as I saw the following error in Event Viewer after each BSoD -  \n`Dump file creation failed due to error during dump creation. BugCheckProgress was: 0x00040049`\n\nI am suspecting the issue to be related to my storage somehow now but I don't know how to confirm this. Would really appreciate some help here.\n\nI am now realising that the 3 errors I got on the day I installed my new SSD also show the same error while creating the dump in Event Viewer.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm really hoping someone can help me with a frustrating audio issue on my Windows 11 PC that I've been troubleshooting for hours.\n\n**My System:**\n\n* **OS:** Windows 11 (Latest updates installed)\n* **Motherboard:** ASRock B650I Lightning Wifi\n* **Audio Chipset:** Onboard Realtek Audio\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA (Latest Game Ready Drivers installed via NVIDIA App, including NVIDIA HD Audio Drivers)\n* **Connections:** Headset plugged into the rear lime green port, Headset microphone into the rear pink port. No front panel audio jacks.\n* **Headphones:** Razer Blackshark V2\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nI need the official Realtek drivers installed because I rely on the **sidetone** feature. However, every time I install the proper Realtek drivers (from ASRock's website), my main Windows audio (input and output) stops working, and the list of output devices starts \"blinking\" (a device is very quickly appearing and disappearing) \n\n* **With Generic Windows Drivers:** If I completely uninstall Realtek drivers (using DDU), Windows loads a generic \"High Definition Audio Device\" driver. With this, **audio input and output work perfectly fine**, but there's **no sidetone** functionality.\n* **With ASRock Realtek Drivers Installed:** When I install the official Realtek driver for my motherboard (B650I Lightning Wifi for Win 11 from ASRock's site):\n   * **Sidetone WORKS** (I can enable it in Windows Sound settings > Playback > Speakers > Properties > Levels > Microphone to 100 and hear myself).\n   * **NO Windows audio input or output.** Test tones fail. No sound from apps, mic doesn't register in apps.\n   * The Realtek Audio Console app *does* correctly detect that my speakers and mic are plugged into the right ports.\n   * Initially, there's no device blinking/conflict in Sound Settings.\n   * If I try to change *any* setting for the Speakers (like disabling Audio Enhancements or Exclusive Mode), the **device list starts blinking rapidly** again (the driver conflict loop), and the setting change doesn't stick. Restarting stops the blinking but doesn't fix the audio.\n\n**What I've Already Tried (Extensively):**\n\n1. **Clean Driver Installs:** Used DDU multiple times to remove Realtek and leftover Soundblaster drivers before reinstalling. Always ran installers as administrator.\n2. **Driver Sources:**\n   * Tried the **latest official ASRock driver** for my specific motherboard/OS multiple times. (This is the one that installs but breaks audio & causes blinking when settings are changed).\n   * Tried **generic Realtek drivers** (R2.82 and R2.83) directly from Realtek/third-party sites - these **fail to install** completely with an error.\n   * Checked **Windows Update** (including Optional Updates) - no Realtek drivers offered.\n3. **Windows Settings:**\n   * Verified Speakers/Mic are set as **Default Device** in the classic sound panel (`mmsys.cpl`).\n   * Toggled **Audio Enhancements** (disabling this on the ASRock driver triggers the blinking bug).\n   * Toggled **Exclusive Mode** (disabling this also triggers the blinking bug).\n   * Tried changing the **Default Format** (Sample Rate).\n   * Restarted **Windows Audio** and **Windows Audio Endpoint Builder** services.\n4. **Realtek Audio Console:**\n   * Confirmed devices show as connected.\n   * Confirmed **Speaker Configuration** is set to \"Stereo\" (not 5.1/7.1).\n   * Checked for any mutes or low volume sliders within the app.\n5. **System Checks:**\n   * Ran `sfc /scannow` (no integrity violations found).\n   * Checked **BIOS**: Onboard HD Audio is enabled, Front Panel type set to HD Audio. BIOS is reasonably up-to-date.\n6. **Conflict Resolution:**\n   * When using generic drivers, ensured NVIDIA HD Audio and the generic HD Audio device (for Realtek) were correctly identified.\n   * When the ASRock driver caused blinking, disabling the other HD Audio devices (GPU ones) stopped the blinking, but didn't fix the lack of sound from the Realtek driver itself.\n\nI'm at my wit's end. It seems the ASRock driver is fundamentally broken or incompatible, but the generic Realtek ones won't install, and the basic Windows one lacks the feature I need. Has anyone seen this specific behaviour (sidetone working but nothing else, driver crashing when settings touched) with ASRock/Realtek on Win 11?\n\nAny fresh ideas would be massively appreciated! Thanks!",

It was working perfectly fine all week, then a few days ago started weirdly crashing to black screen and would cycle through all the monitors like it was trying to detect a screen to use.  The PC does not shut down or restart though, and the only way I'm able to restart it is by switching the PSU off/on.  NO OTHER GAME DOES THIS nor does me playing the campaign...\n\nAfter dealing with the headache of having to wipe my entire PC to upgrade to Windows 11 just to enable secure boot, I'm just so over Battlefield & PC gaming in general.  I had a few console friends I was sooo close to converting to PC, but after all the headaches I've had they now laugh at me and will probably never convert haha\n\nI just took my PC to microcenter as well and they ran diagnostics tests for another issue I was having (blue screen crashing), and they said I had faulty RAM & a HDD which have since be removed & replaced, not sure if that's relevant info but they never diagnosed anything else as being an issue.\n\nPlease and thank you! \n\n\\-a frustrated PC gamer",

The PC is essentially bricked because I can't interact with the recovery menus.\n\nWhat Led Me Here:\n¬∑ My PC would boot randomly, so I tried to restart it through settings. \n¬∑ Upon reaching any blue recovery screen, my USB keyboard and mouse would lose power/function. (No lights on the keyboard).\n¬∑ I managed to get to the \"Reset this PC\" screen by Resetting the PC through the Settings, but now I'm stuck at ‚ÄúReset this Pc‚Äù because I can't click \"Got it\" or any other option.",

I'd like to know if they're completely interchangeable. So, I can buy the required display, remove the old one, install the new one, and that's it, no OS or hardware modifications, etc. Or at least find a similar model with a 1366x768 IPS display?

    "selftext": "Hello, I have a following problem which I've been struggling today while upgrading pc.\n\nI've just changed the base of PC - Motherboard/Rams/CPU.\n\nEverything worked out perfectly - device booted up - MSI center autoinstallation appeared - Installed and restarted 2 times afterwards - That is where my problem begins.\n\nNot sure if it happened before or after this restart, but after i went into file explorer - i noticed missing one partition from PC. Had C - 200GB E: 300GB and D: 500GB.\n\nD: Partition - Vanished completely - The only sign that it was there was recent searches which is \"D: ?\" now and all of the files/games are missing.\n\nIt seems like Bios/Motherboard/Drivers see the SSD but wrognly. In reality i have Crucial 1TB 2,5\" SATA SSD MX500.\n\nHowever it looks like it is now 500GB and everything acts like that's the reality now :D\n\nPartition is not hidden. There is no unallocated storage. I tried remove 1GB of one of the partition - the 1GB appeared as unallocated - nothing more.\n\nTried updating some drivers - nothing. BIOS is on 1.0L version if I can see correctly - Not sure if that is the correct one - I had it flashed by the store which i bought it from to avoid bricking it myself.\n\nThought it might be becaue I didn't use the fresh install. I decided to create boot stick with win 11 - Unfortunately, during the installation i could already see it's missing the 500GB. Just went through with it and finished with one partition so that it's just done. Installed correctly - Still missing 500GB.\n\nAny idea what should i look at more? Maybe the BIOS version or some settings there that could cause this?\n\nIt's literally like PC see the wrong type of SSD. 500GB instead of 1 TB.",

    "selftext": "I have recently run into an issue with my PC and I am struggling to find a way to identify the source of the problem. Every session with my PC results in a single problem that occurs once during that session. At some point the audio I/O for my headset stops working, preceded by the disconnected device sound and then followed by the reconnected device sound. As this disconnect and reconnect is occurring the videogame or youtube video that is being watched lags heavily for 2 seconds. Before upgrading to windows 11 last week, this occasionally resulted in a BSOD playing certain video games. I have uninstalled everything Nvidia related and reinstalled and updated drivers. Uninstalled all audio devices and reinstalled as far as i can tell. Is there a way or program that can actually detect the issue or whats causing this crash or bug in what i presume is an audio driver. Is this a graphics card issue possibly?",

The only cause I can think of is I had to switch my PC off with the power button rather than the usual shutdown menu, but I‚Äôve done this before without these issues occurring. I did some brief research and most sites recommend restarting the router, but I don‚Äôt have access to mine (university wifi, not my own), so I can‚Äôt really do this. Again, the problem isn‚Äôt affecting any other devices, so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll be the cause anyway, but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nSome more things I feel may be of note:\n- I have been using an ethernet cable for the past week or so and without any issues\n- I‚Äôve tried connecting to two other networks, one of which being my phone‚Äôs hotspot, and both had the same issue of connecting but no internet\n- I‚Äôve tried restarting the device at least thrice now, twice within fairly quick succession and once this morning after having it switched off overnight.

As if it needs to buffer for 30-60 seconds before playing the video like normal. \n\n2: Flicker the video and continue playing it, but without any audio coming from the earbuds or phone speaker.\n\nI've found each problem has a very temporary solution (it'll have one of the issues again within 3-5 videos after)\n\nIf it freezes I can flick the phone into airplane mode disconnecting internet and Bluetooth for a sec, then turn it off and things work again. If it flickers I can tap the Bluetooth icon and just hit the disconnect and reconnect on my earbuds real quick and it comes back. \n\nContext:\n\nI've turned it off and back on. Both phone and drained the raycon battery.\n\nI've cleared YouTube cache/storage, and uninstalled and reinstalled. \n\nI've cleared other phone memory in settings, and flicked several setting options on or off in the Bluetooth settings and the raycons on the phone.\n\nI haven't been able to find my old Bluetooth earbuds yet to see if they have the same issue. \n\nHowever, I have tried my earbuds with a tablet and I do not have the same issue\n\nI'm concerned that one of the next steps is a factory reset, but before I try it I figured I should ask and see if anyone has some hidden gem of info. Appreciate you all, thank you! ",

    "title": "GPU Started fire, several burnt capacitors. What does it mean for my other components?",
    "selftext": "I was playing a game on my desktop a few days ago when my screen went dark, the fans stopped spinning, but the power light still stayed on. Without really thinking (I thought it crashed or something, my laptop has crashed in similar ways), I clicked the power button, and the fans all started spinning again, only to hear a pop and to see my GPU to light on fire. I of course immediately switched off the outlet it was plugged into but the damage to the GPU was already done. There are 3 large round capacitors on the top of my card by the ports which are burnt. Here is a picture showing 2 of the capacitors (the third is behind the very burnt one): [https://imgur.com/a/aAq4Cmm](https://imgur.com/a/aAq4Cmm)\n\nI have since removed the GPU and booted the PC using the IGPU and everything seems fine (looking back that was probably quite stupid and could have caused another fire). No data seems to be lost, all my RAM, SSDs, fans, etc seem to still be working. When I initially turned the monitor on I thought it was done for, as it appeared to have a lot of broken pixels only displaying blue, but even with that just turning it on and off again seemed to fix it. So, while nothing seems to be wrong now, I am still incredibly nervous about it and don't think I want to replace the GPU until I have a better idea of what happened. \n\n\n\nWhile I am sad the GPU is probably done for, my main concern now is for the rest of my computer. I am nervous that something else my be wrong with it given that the failure literally caused it to light on fire. So this is leaving me with a few questions:\n\n* What signs of damage should I be looking for? \n* Are there any components I should be particularly concerned about?\n* How can I try and find the source of the problem?\n\nMy first thought is that maybe it was a power surge or that the PSU is faulty, and that if I were to buy a new GPU or even just plan on keeping the PC I should repalce it? I am not sure what else could have caused it to fail in such a way. I have heard of capacitors popping on cards when they get old enough, but I have never heard or seen anything like this.\n\n\n\nThe GPU in question was a Gigabyte GTX 1650 Super, that I bought refurbished 4 years ago(along with everything else I bought new), but having found some old pictures of the box the GPU seems to have been originally bought almost 6 years ago. here is also a link to gigabyte's page on the card: [https://www.gigabyte.com/ie/Graphics-Card/GV-N165SWF2OC-4GD](https://www.gigabyte.com/ie/Graphics-Card/GV-N165SWF2OC-4GD)\n\nSome of the other specs include:\n\n* CPU: Ryzen 5 5600G\n* Mobo: Gigabyte B550M DS3H\n* RAM: 2x 8GB g.skill ripjaws\n* PSU: Gigabyte P650B",

    "selftext": "hey all... last week i upgraded my pc, bought a b850 max wifi along with a 9800x3d, adata xpg lancer neon ddr5 6400mhz 2x16GB ram kit and a wd black sn850x 2tb nvme, but since then im getting constant freezes and bsods, no matter what im doing, be it browsing, gaming or even when it's idle, and it's ALWAYS around 3 hours of use ... my gpu is a rtx 5080 and my psu is a xfx 850w\n\nwhat i already tried:\n\n1. updated bios to lastest version (7E62v2A48)\n2. formatted pc 3 times, windows 11 or 10, same thing\n3. clean gpu drivers installation with ddu\n4. ran windows driver verifier, used to give me bsod immediately after activating it, after the last format it runs fine now, but pc still crashes after a few hours\n5. memtest ran for 3 hours, passed all tests, zero errors\n6. stress cpu test with prime95, no errors\n7. memory expo, xmp or default, no changes\n8. leaving pc on idle immediately after formatting, before even connecting to the internet, still crashed after a few hours\n9. went back to my old rtx3080 to make sure it wasn't a psu (or gpu) problem, still the same thing\n10. cleaned all drivers and manually installed them from msi mobo page\n11. removed the new nvme and installed windows again on the old one, that worked fine with the old setup, still same exact thing, crash and bsod around 3 hours mark\n\none thing i noticed, this new mobo has two 8pin slots for the cpu but my psu only has one cpu 8 pin connector, do you think this could be the cause for the crashes? i searched something about this and apparently it should work fine with only 1 connector, but who knows\n\nmy gpu worked fine before upgrading, with my old i7 9700k and msi gaming plus mobo\n\nthe errors i get are different each time, like KMODE\\_EXCEPTION\\_NOT\\_HANDLED tcpip.sys, or PAGE\\_FAULT\\_IN\\_NONPAGED\\_AREA ntoskrnl.exe, one caused by PSHED.dll and ntoskrnl.exe, and so on\n\ni have a bunch of logs in case anyone feels like taking a look at them, but man, i'm at my wits end with this, who knew a simple upgrade would be so stressing haha\n\n[https://app.mediafire.com/folder/dzrc5e6e9lf1z](https://app.mediafire.com/folder/dzrc5e6e9lf1z)\n\nappreciate any help",

If some beads are still stuck deep inside (like in the hinge or near the fan), can that cause long-term damage later? What about this sound i heard when i opened/ closed the screen?",

Yesterday I was playing some project zomboid, had some yt playing in the background and suddently everything froze completely, audio gone, no weird noises from pc, everything the same just frozen. After about 5 minutes, with video output still frozen (not black, just frozen game), i just decided to click the restart button on my case, after which the pc didn't post.\n\nI have:\nRyzen 7 9700x\nAsrock x870 pro rs wifi\nKingston fury ddr5 2 sticks\nAsus 3060ti\n\nThe pc turns on, but never posts, all fans spin, but the motherboard has red and yellow lights on it. According to asrock manual it means CPU and DRAM issue. \n\nSo far ive tried:\nChanging ram stick places, booting with only a single stick in every slot\n\nCmos battery reset\n\nMotherboard bios flashback\n\nNeither of these helped with the issue and everything remains exactly the same. The pc starts up but those 2 red and yellow lights stay on, no video output, no other noises or beeps. \n\nI do not have any other components to swap test anything. I am a bit lost, though I do have warranty on most parts and wonder if theres anything else i should try before i try the warranty option? \n",

I checked two other devices (phone and laptop), both work just fine on the same WiFi network so I‚Äôm assuming the issue is with the computer. I‚Äôve connected to the wifi on the computer before, so this is a new issue. The only cause I can think of is I had to switch my PC off with the power button rather than the usual shutdown menu, but I‚Äôve done this before without these issues occurring. I did some brief research and most sites recommend restarting the router, but I don‚Äôt have access to mine (university wifi, not my own), so I can‚Äôt really do this. Again, the problem isn‚Äôt affecting any other devices, so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll be the cause anyway, but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nSome more things I feel may be of note:\n- I have been using an ethernet cable for the past week or so and without any issues\n- I‚Äôve tried connecting to two other networks, one of which being my phone‚Äôs hotspot, and both had the same issue of connecting but no internet\n- I‚Äôve tried restarting the device at least thrice now, twice within fairly quick succession and once this morning after having it switched off overnight. None of the restarts fixed anything\n- The device in question is a desktop computer, windows 11. Not sure what specs may be needed to troubleshoot, so I‚Äôll update with some if asked for them.",

As if it needs to buffer for 30-60 seconds before playing the video like normal. \n\n2: Flicker the video and continue playing it, but without any audio coming from the earbuds or phone speaker.\n\nI've found each problem has a very temporary solution (it'll have one of the issues again within 3-5 videos after)\n\nIf it freezes I can flick the phone into airplane mode disconnecting internet and Bluetooth for a sec, then turn it off and things work again. If it flickers I can tap the Bluetooth icon and just hit the disconnect and reconnect on my earbuds real quick and it comes back. \n\nContext:\n\nI've turned it off and back on. Both phone and drained the raycon battery.\n\nI've cleared YouTube cache/storage, and uninstalled and reinstalled. \n\nI've cleared other phone memory in settings, and flicked several setting options on or off in the Bluetooth settings and the raycons on the phone.\n\nI haven't been able to find my old Bluetooth earbuds yet to see if they have the same issue. \n\nHowever, I have tried my earbuds with a tablet and I do not have the same issue\n\nI'm concerned that one of the next steps is a factory reset, but before I try it I figured I should ask and see if anyone has some hidden gem of info.

    "selftext": "I was playing a game on my desktop a few days ago when my screen went dark, the fans stopped spinning, but the power light still stayed on. Without really thinking (I thought it crashed or something, my laptop has crashed in similar ways), I clicked the power button, and the fans all started spinning again, only to hear a pop and to see my GPU to light on fire. I of course immediately switched off the outlet it was plugged into but the damage to the GPU was already done. There are 3 large round capacitors on the top of my card by the ports which are burnt. Here is a picture showing 2 of the capacitors (the third is behind the very burnt one): [https://imgur.com/a/aAq4Cmm](https://imgur.com/a/aAq4Cmm)\n\nI have since removed the GPU and booted the PC using the IGPU and everything seems fine (looking back that was probably quite stupid and could have caused another fire). No data seems to be lost, all my RAM, SSDs, fans, etc seem to still be working. When I initially turned the monitor on I thought it was done for, as it appeared to have a lot of broken pixels only displaying blue, but even with that just turning it on and off again seemed to fix it. So, while nothing seems to be wrong now, I am still incredibly nervous about it and don't think I want to replace the GPU until I have a better idea of what happened. \n\n\n\nWhile I am sad the GPU is probably done for, my main concern now is for the rest of my computer. I am nervous that something else my be wrong with it given that the failure literally caused it to light on fire. So this is leaving me with a few questions:\n\n* What signs of damage should I be looking for? \n* Are there any components I should be particularly concerned about?\n* How can I try and find the source of the problem?\n\nMy first thought is that maybe it was a power surge or that the PSU is faulty, and that if I were to buy a new GPU or even just plan on keeping the PC I should repalce it? I am not sure what else could have caused it to fail in such a way. I have heard of capacitors popping on cards when they get old enough, but I have never heard or seen anything like this.\n\n\n\nThe GPU in question was a Gigabyte GTX 1650 Super, that I bought refurbished 4 years ago(along with everything else I bought new), but having found some old pictures of the box the GPU seems to have been originally bought almost 6 years ago. here is also a link to gigabyte's page on the card: [https://www.gigabyte.com/ie/Graphics-Card/GV-N165SWF2OC-4GD](https://www.gigabyte.com/ie/Graphics-Card/GV-N165SWF2OC-4GD)\n\nSome of the other specs include:\n\n* CPU: Ryzen 5 5600G\n* Mobo: Gigabyte B550M DS3H\n* RAM: 2x 8GB g.skill ripjaws\n* PSU: Gigabyte P650B",

Since I got a new PC, the external HDD always starts up when the PC is booting up, even if the enclosure was turned off. Is there some setting in the BIOS that I'm missing or am I just out of luck and will have to manually plug in the power cord when I need the HDD?",

    "selftext": "Windows 11. Been freeing up space for things I don't play anymore recently. I have some questions on how should I go about uninstalling The Sims 4 and Electronic Arts app (that I got through Steam instead of the website). I have no plans on returning to the software.\n\n1) Do I unlink EA from Steam before I start doing anything else? Or will this break something?\n\n2) Do I need to do things in a specific order (e.g. uninstall TS4 through Steam/Control Panel first then EA app)?\n\n3) Does it also delete the CC (custom content) in the folder or will I have to do that manually?\n\nI've already searched for troubleshooting answers but to no avail. It is also against the respective subreddits' rules to post asking about this.\n\nThank you to anyone who is able to give me advice! (Preferably not looking for uninstallers by the way.)",

I made a mistake earlier today ‚Äî I inserted an old flash drive (generally used for printing stuff) and got my new built PC infected with Trojan:Win32/Malgent!MTB and the affected file is a sys32 printui.dll ‚Äî It was labeled as Severe and is Quarantined, see here: https://imgur.com/a/Jzm1Spb \n\nI followed Windows Security > Actions > Remove File. After that, Windows Security said it was removed but I can‚Äôt be so sure since this is my first time getting a Trojan so I rechecked my C: and found two Windows Directory (technically three but the other has .old at the end).\n\nI find it sus as the other Windows folder is modified during the time I inserted the infected flash drive. I ran this on admin cmd: dir c:\\*w /w and got: Directories of C:\\ [Windows] [Windows ] [Windows.old] ‚Äî I have yet to do fresh OS install so why am I getting another Windows directory with a space at the end? Am I overthinking it? Could this trojan actually create a fake directory?\n\nAny help or insight on what should I do next would be much appreciated!",
