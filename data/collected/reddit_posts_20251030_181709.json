    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

Over the course of 2025, I would randomly experience these random crashes, where the screen would turn black for about 5 seconds, and then show the lock screen. After re-opening the phone it was acting like I had just restarted it. Over time they started happening more and more often, until eventually the phone got stuck in a boot loop that I couldn‚Äôt get it out of. \n\nApple rep over the phone told me they couldn‚Äôt really point a cause other than the fact that they thought that maybe there was some sort of software corruption in the OS. The phone had a shattered backglass, and the battery was horrible. So I just went to AT&T and bought a new phone. When I brought in the 13 to see if they‚Äôd take it for trade in, they thought it was a hardware issue. \n\nI bought a 16 Pro, and now I‚Äôm starting to have the same issue where the phone will crash randomly. At first I thought maybe it had something to do with the damage on my 13 or the OS error. But now I‚Äôm wondering what‚Äôs going on.

For those who do, what brand? Im eyeing on this flolab antireflective for. Or spigen? Whats the issue with lens protector anyway exactly? Does it blur my photos? By how much? Or bcos of the glare? Will an anti reflective coating solve that? ",

    "selftext": "I have an iPhone 12, had it for maybe four years. I have a bunch of photos on it from several vacations over the years, including some photos that were transferred over from a previous iPhone. I have admittedly been lazy about doing backups.  I have iCloud backup turned on, but I'm not certain if I had it turned on several years ago. Other than a few specific pics I downloaded to my PC, I just left the photos on the phone with a plan to someday download or back them up.\n\nIn the last several years, I was getting a little worried that I might be running out of storage space because of the number of photos on the phone, so I would occasionally check the storage display only to find I had seemingly lots of storage left. I was pretty impressed with how many photos (and some videos) were stored on that phone. There are several thousand photos and a few hundred short video clips. But I was recently on a three-week European trip and took HUNDREDS of photos and a lot of short videos and my storage display still shows GOBS of available space. The little bar graph seems to indicate only a tiny sliver of space is occupied by photos.\n\nI finally started the process of downloading and backing up photos and noticed that hundreds of photos from vacations several years ago are missing. I know that at least some of them were taken with a previous phone and transferred over when I bought the current phone.\n\nWhat happened? Is it most likely that they were lost when the old phone contents were moved to the new phone? Is there any way to get them back? I have iCloud backup, but my understanding is that I can't view and selectively download photos, am I right?",

    "selftext": "Hello, I'm new here and I hope this is following post rules. After recent developments with the future of Android as an OS, I'm considering switching to iPhone when the time to upgrade comes. I'm already on Mac, so I guess entering the ecosystem makes sense. \n\nAs the tag specifies, I'm hoping moreso to start a discussion than just ask a question. Sure, yes. I love how open the Android OS has been. I love being in control of my files, doing whatever I want with it, and not having to deal with iOS's walled garden. I have never had an iPhone, but I did have an iPod Touch fourth generation a decade ago, and I set up my grandma's iPad for her. My experience with it is limited, but I think I get the gist.\n\nThe main reason I'm even considering this decision stems from just not needing the capabilities of a computer in my pocket as much, anymore. I realize iPhones are very solid and do what they do well. Regardless of my opinions on Apple the company, they typically seem to deliver on their products. What do you do with your iPhone, just running apps and web browsing? Do you still put your own music files on yours and sync it from the Apple Music Mac app, or do you just use the subscription? Artists, do you use yours for art, or did you shell out for an iPad and the Apple Pencil? \n\nHopefully we can just have a civil discussion without tearing down one platform or another.\n\nTLDR: I may upgrade to iPhone in the future, hoping for discussions on why you prefer your iPhone to Android, if you've used it previously.",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n‚Äã\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

After recent developments with the future of Android as an OS, I'm considering switching to iPhone when the time to upgrade comes. I'm already on Mac, so I guess entering the ecosystem makes sense. \n\nAs the tag specifies, I'm hoping moreso to start a discussion than just ask a question. Sure, yes. I love how open the Android OS has been. I love being in control of my files, doing whatever I want with it, and not having to deal with iOS's walled garden. I have never had an iPhone, but I did have an iPod Touch fourth generation a decade ago, and I set up my grandma's iPad for her. My experience with it is limited, but I think I get the gist.\n\nThe main reason I'm even considering this decision stems from just not needing the capabilities of a computer in my pocket as much, anymore. I realize iPhones are very solid and do what they do well. Regardless of my opinions on Apple the company, they typically seem to deliver on their products. What do you do with your iPhone, just running apps and web browsing? Do you still put your own music files on yours and sync it from the Apple Music Mac app, or do you just use the subscription? Artists, do you use yours for art, or did you shell out for an iPad and the Apple Pencil? \n\nHopefully we can just have a civil discussion without tearing down one platform or another.\n\nTLDR: I may upgrade to iPhone in the future, hoping for discussions on why you prefer your iPhone to Android, if you've used it previously.",

    "selftext": "I have an iPhone 12, had it for maybe four years. I have a bunch of photos on it from several vacations over the years, including some photos that were transferred over from a previous iPhone. I have admittedly been lazy about doing backups.  I have iCloud backup turned on, but I'm not certain if I had it turned on several years ago. Other than a few specific pics I downloaded to my PC, I just left the photos on the phone with a plan to someday download or back them up.\n\nIn the last several years, I was getting a little worried that I might be running out of storage space because of the number of photos on the phone, so I would occasionally check the storage display only to find I had seemingly lots of storage left. I was pretty impressed with how many photos (and some videos) were stored on that phone. There are several thousand photos and a few hundred short video clips. But I was recently on a three-week European trip and took HUNDREDS of photos and a lot of short videos and my storage display still shows GOBS of available space. The little bar graph seems to indicate only a tiny sliver of space is occupied by photos.\n\nI finally started the process of downloading and backing up photos and noticed that hundreds of photos from vacations several years ago are missing. I know that at least some of them were taken with a previous phone and transferred over when I bought the current phone.\n\nWhat happened? Is it most likely that they were lost when the old phone contents were moved to the new phone? Is there any way to get them back? I have iCloud backup, but my understanding is that I can't view and selectively download photos, am I right?",

Over the course of 2025, I would randomly experience these random crashes, where the screen would turn black for about 5 seconds, and then show the lock screen. After re-opening the phone it was acting like I had just restarted it. Over time they started happening more and more often, until eventually the phone got stuck in a boot loop that I couldn‚Äôt get it out of. \n\nApple rep over the phone told me they couldn‚Äôt really point a cause other than the fact that they thought that maybe there was some sort of software corruption in the OS. The phone had a shattered backglass, and the battery was horrible. So I just went to AT&T and bought a new phone. When I brought in the 13 to see if they‚Äôd take it for trade in, they thought it was a hardware issue. \n\nI bought a 16 Pro, and now I‚Äôm starting to have the same issue where the phone will crash randomly. At first I thought maybe it had something to do with the damage on my 13 or the OS error. But now I‚Äôm wondering what‚Äôs going on. I don‚Äôt overwork my phone with strenuous activity, and I‚Äôve maybe dropped it once or twice. \n\nHas anybody else ever had this issue? If anybody could shed some light on this I‚Äôd appreciate it greatly. ",

After recent developments with the future of Android as an OS, I'm considering switching to iPhone when the time to upgrade comes. I'm already on Mac, so I guess entering the ecosystem makes sense. \n\nAs the tag specifies, I'm hoping moreso to start a discussion than just ask a question. Sure, yes. I love how open the Android OS has been. I love being in control of my files, doing whatever I want with it, and not having to deal with iOS's walled garden. I have never had an iPhone, but I did have an iPod Touch fourth generation a decade ago, and I set up my grandma's iPad for her. My experience with it is limited, but I think I get the gist.\n\nThe main reason I'm even considering this decision stems from just not needing the capabilities of a computer in my pocket as much, anymore. I realize iPhones are very solid and do what they do well. Regardless of my opinions on Apple the company, they typically seem to deliver on their products. What do you do with your iPhone, just running apps and web browsing? Do you still put your own music files on yours and sync it from the Apple Music Mac app, or do you just use the subscription? Artists, do you use yours for art, or did you shell out for an iPad and the Apple Pencil? \n\nHopefully we can just have a civil discussion without tearing down one platform or another.\n\nTLDR: I may upgrade to iPhone in the future, hoping for discussions on why you prefer your iPhone to Android, if you've used it previously.",

    "selftext": "I have an iPhone 12, had it for maybe four years. I have a bunch of photos on it from several vacations over the years, including some photos that were transferred over from a previous iPhone. I have admittedly been lazy about doing backups.  I have iCloud backup turned on, but I'm not certain if I had it turned on several years ago. Other than a few specific pics I downloaded to my PC, I just left the photos on the phone with a plan to someday download or back them up.\n\nIn the last several years, I was getting a little worried that I might be running out of storage space because of the number of photos on the phone, so I would occasionally check the storage display only to find I had seemingly lots of storage left. I was pretty impressed with how many photos (and some videos) were stored on that phone. There are several thousand photos and a few hundred short video clips. But I was recently on a three-week European trip and took HUNDREDS of photos and a lot of short videos and my storage display still shows GOBS of available space. The little bar graph seems to indicate only a tiny sliver of space is occupied by photos.\n\nI finally started the process of downloading and backing up photos and noticed that hundreds of photos from vacations several years ago are missing. I know that at least some of them were taken with a previous phone and transferred over when I bought the current phone.\n\nWhat happened? Is it most likely that they were lost when the old phone contents were moved to the new phone? Is there any way to get them back? I have iCloud backup, but my understanding is that I can't view and selectively download photos, am I right?",

Over the course of 2025, I would randomly experience these random crashes, where the screen would turn black for about 5 seconds, and then show the lock screen. After re-opening the phone it was acting like I had just restarted it. Over time they started happening more and more often, until eventually the phone got stuck in a boot loop that I couldn‚Äôt get it out of. \n\nApple rep over the phone told me they couldn‚Äôt really point a cause other than the fact that they thought that maybe there was some sort of software corruption in the OS. The phone had a shattered backglass, and the battery was horrible. So I just went to AT&T and bought a new phone. When I brought in the 13 to see if they‚Äôd take it for trade in, they thought it was a hardware issue. \n\nI bought a 16 Pro, and now I‚Äôm starting to have the same issue where the phone will crash randomly. At first I thought maybe it had something to do with the damage on my 13 or the OS error. But now I‚Äôm wondering what‚Äôs going on. I don‚Äôt overwork my phone with strenuous activity, and I‚Äôve maybe dropped it once or twice. \n\nHas anybody else ever had this issue? If anybody could shed some light on this I‚Äôd appreciate it greatly. ",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Alert: Feature creates Severe Vulnerability",
    "selftext": "Recently, I received a text from Android that during an update a new feature was automatically enabled. This feature is called Smart Wi-Fi and on the surface it seems like a great idea that will ensure you are always connected to Wi-Fi instead of using your Mobile Data. However, this feature is also enabled automatically (and this is important), which is one of the roots of the problem.\n\nBefore continuing, I should point out that I've been in IT for over 23 years, 12 of which were specializing in Cybersecurity and I currently hold both the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker through EC Council) as well as my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional through Offensive Security which is also an Ethical Hacker certification). With that out of the way, please allow me to explain what the vulnerability is and how it affects everyone that uses it.\n\nThe Smart Wi-Fi feature attempts to work much like Mesh Networking which is to say, you stay connected to a Wi-Fi network internet enabled device without interruption so the switch is seamless and instant, and it stays connected to the most powerful network detected, ensuring the strongest connection. This feature operates much like how Cisco and Ubiquity Unifi's Mesh networking works.\n\nThe big difference however is with Cisco and Unifi Mesh networking (and other similar mesh networking) you rely on multiple devices connected to the SAME network, thus you don't change networks but rather you stay connected to the closes device on the network you're attached to ensuring the best connection signal even when roaming around.\n\nWith me so far? Great! Now let's discuss the vulnerability.\n\nUnlike Mesh Networking as mentioned above, Smart Wi-Fi attempts to remain connected to Wi-Fi devices. It does state Known networks but in testing, I was able to connect to my rogue Wi-Fi network automatically despite not being in my known network list and the why is simple.\n\nThere's a technique known as Man-In-The-Middle or MITM for short, which is used by both Red Team (Penetration Testers/Ethical Hackers) as well as Threat Actors. In this process what I would do is set up my rogue Wi-Fi network provider and mimic the SSID of the network I want to compromise. I then leave the password option off and then broadcast the Wi-Fi signal at a stronger strength than what the devices inside the network I want to compromise is. Because of this Smart Wi-Fi feature, those with this SSID saved have a good chance of automatically connecting to my rogue Wi-Fi device and since I provide internet through it, they aren't the wiser. This happens as soon as the device they're connected to becomes weaker than mine. Once this happens, I may push a prompt that asks the user to reenter their Wi-Fi credentials, and if successful I just compromised the target networks security, bypassing it completely.\n\nHome owners will likely not have much to worry about as Threat Actors don't typically attempt to attack home networks - it's really a waste of time and effort with little to gain. However, government and businesses are prime targets.\n\nThe solution is to disable the option that is automatically enabled which allows your Android phone to connect to the strongest Known network. The risk isn't in connecting to known networks, but rather the automatic switching of networks which enables the use of SSID Spoofing and MITM attacks.\n\nI hope this does some of you good and hopefully Android's team will also see this and have this feature disabled by default instead of enabled. That way if people want to take the risk they can instead of being unaware of the risk in the first place.",

No tracking.\n\nCore features are:\n\n* üì• **Save Anything** ‚Äî links, TikToks, YouTube videos, and articles.\n* üìë **Folders & Tags** ‚Äî organize everything in a clean, minimal interface.\n* üîó **Multi-Paste URLs** ‚Äî save multiple links at once.\n* ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Sync & Backup** ‚Äî your data stays safe and accessible.\n* üîç **Smart Search** ‚Äî find anything you‚Äôve saved instantly.\n* üì§ **Import/Export** ‚Äî move your bookmarks from browsers or other apps.\n* ‚ö° **Offline Support** (coming soon).\n\nIt‚Äôs completely free to try, and even the paid plans are much cheaper than others.  \nNo hidden fees, no data selling, no tracking.\n\nWould love your feedback ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre into productivity tools or use bookmarking apps!\n\nüëâ Google Play: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saveitlater.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saveitlater.app)  \n\nüëâ App Store: [https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/save-it-later/id6752220740](https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/save-it-later/id6752220740)",

I‚Äôve been working on something I‚Äôm really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It‚Äôs a great feature, but it‚Äôs locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built¬†**MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to¬†**any Android phone running Android 9 or above**¬†‚Äî including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt‚Äôs still in early access and I‚Äôd love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper)¬†\n\nThis is just the beginning - I‚Äôm actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you‚Äôre into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I‚Äôd really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

It‚Äôs shocking how a premium device costing nearly ‚Çπ1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite ‚Äî big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you‚Äôre left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand‚Äôs promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Alert: Feature creates Severe Vulnerability",
    "selftext": "Recently, I received a text from Android that during an update a new feature was automatically enabled. This feature is called Smart Wi-Fi and on the surface it seems like a great idea that will ensure you are always connected to Wi-Fi instead of using your Mobile Data. However, this feature is also enabled automatically (and this is important), which is one of the roots of the problem.\n\nBefore continuing, I should point out that I've been in IT for over 23 years, 12 of which were specializing in Cybersecurity and I currently hold both the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker through EC Council) as well as my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional through Offensive Security which is also an Ethical Hacker certification). With that out of the way, please allow me to explain what the vulnerability is and how it affects everyone that uses it.\n\nThe Smart Wi-Fi feature attempts to work much like Mesh Networking which is to say, you stay connected to a Wi-Fi network internet enabled device without interruption so the switch is seamless and instant, and it stays connected to the most powerful network detected, ensuring the strongest connection. This feature operates much like how Cisco and Ubiquity Unifi's Mesh networking works.\n\nThe big difference however is with Cisco and Unifi Mesh networking (and other similar mesh networking) you rely on multiple devices connected to the SAME network, thus you don't change networks but rather you stay connected to the closes device on the network you're attached to ensuring the best connection signal even when roaming around.\n\nWith me so far? Great! Now let's discuss the vulnerability.\n\nUnlike Mesh Networking as mentioned above, Smart Wi-Fi attempts to remain connected to Wi-Fi devices. It does state Known networks but in testing, I was able to connect to my rogue Wi-Fi network automatically despite not being in my known network list and the why is simple.\n\nThere's a technique known as Man-In-The-Middle or MITM for short, which is used by both Red Team (Penetration Testers/Ethical Hackers) as well as Threat Actors. In this process what I would do is set up my rogue Wi-Fi network provider and mimic the SSID of the network I want to compromise. I then leave the password option off and then broadcast the Wi-Fi signal at a stronger strength than what the devices inside the network I want to compromise is. Because of this Smart Wi-Fi feature, those with this SSID saved have a good chance of automatically connecting to my rogue Wi-Fi device and since I provide internet through it, they aren't the wiser. This happens as soon as the device they're connected to becomes weaker than mine. Once this happens, I may push a prompt that asks the user to reenter their Wi-Fi credentials, and if successful I just compromised the target networks security, bypassing it completely.\n\nHome owners will likely not have much to worry about as Threat Actors don't typically attempt to attack home networks - it's really a waste of time and effort with little to gain. However, government and businesses are prime targets.\n\nThe solution is to disable the option that is automatically enabled which allows your Android phone to connect to the strongest Known network. The risk isn't in connecting to known networks, but rather the automatic switching of networks which enables the use of SSID Spoofing and MITM attacks.\n\nI hope this does some of you good and hopefully Android's team will also see this and have this feature disabled by default instead of enabled. That way if people want to take the risk they can instead of being unaware of the risk in the first place.",

    "subreddit": "android",
    "title": "Cybersecurity Alert: Feature creates Severe Vulnerability",
    "selftext": "Recently, I received a text from Android that during an update a new feature was automatically enabled. This feature is called Smart Wi-Fi and on the surface it seems like a great idea that will ensure you are always connected to Wi-Fi instead of using your Mobile Data. However, this feature is also enabled automatically (and this is important), which is one of the roots of the problem.\n\nBefore continuing, I should point out that I've been in IT for over 23 years, 12 of which were specializing in Cybersecurity and I currently hold both the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker through EC Council) as well as my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional through Offensive Security which is also an Ethical Hacker certification). With that out of the way, please allow me to explain what the vulnerability is and how it affects everyone that uses it.\n\nThe Smart Wi-Fi feature attempts to work much like Mesh Networking which is to say, you stay connected to a Wi-Fi network internet enabled device without interruption so the switch is seamless and instant, and it stays connected to the most powerful network detected, ensuring the strongest connection. This feature operates much like how Cisco and Ubiquity Unifi's Mesh networking works.\n\nThe big difference however is with Cisco and Unifi Mesh networking (and other similar mesh networking) you rely on multiple devices connected to the SAME network, thus you don't change networks but rather you stay connected to the closes device on the network you're attached to ensuring the best connection signal even when roaming around.\n\nWith me so far? Great! Now let's discuss the vulnerability.\n\nUnlike Mesh Networking as mentioned above, Smart Wi-Fi attempts to remain connected to Wi-Fi devices. It does state Known networks but in testing, I was able to connect to my rogue Wi-Fi network automatically despite not being in my known network list and the why is simple.\n\nThere's a technique known as Man-In-The-Middle or MITM for short, which is used by both Red Team (Penetration Testers/Ethical Hackers) as well as Threat Actors. In this process what I would do is set up my rogue Wi-Fi network provider and mimic the SSID of the network I want to compromise. I then leave the password option off and then broadcast the Wi-Fi signal at a stronger strength than what the devices inside the network I want to compromise is. Because of this Smart Wi-Fi feature, those with this SSID saved have a good chance of automatically connecting to my rogue Wi-Fi device and since I provide internet through it, they aren't the wiser. This happens as soon as the device they're connected to becomes weaker than mine. Once this happens, I may push a prompt that asks the user to reenter their Wi-Fi credentials, and if successful I just compromised the target networks security, bypassing it completely.\n\nHome owners will likely not have much to worry about as Threat Actors don't typically attempt to attack home networks - it's really a waste of time and effort with little to gain. However, government and businesses are prime targets.\n\nThe solution is to disable the option that is automatically enabled which allows your Android phone to connect to the strongest Known network. The risk isn't in connecting to known networks, but rather the automatic switching of networks which enables the use of SSID Spoofing and MITM attacks.\n\nI hope this does some of you good and hopefully Android's team will also see this and have this feature disabled by default instead of enabled. That way if people want to take the risk they can instead of being unaware of the risk in the first place.",

I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced the same issue.\n\nI've been a Pixel user since the good old days of the Pixel 3 XL, and the phone was working fine most of the time. The next Pixel I got was the Pixel 8 Pro, then the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and now I've got my shiny new Pixel 10 Pro XL.\n\nI will have to go on business trips to Chinese Mainland from time to time. Actually I am here for the Canton Fair right now.\n\n\nHere's the problem:\n\nThe phone has VoLTE and VoNR support in Hong Kong SAR with a local SIM from 3HK or roaming with my TWM SIM.\n\nPixels can connect to LTE for Internet access, but without VoLTE and VoNR support in Chinese Mainland with both my local SIMs from China Mobile and China Telecom.\n\nInterestingly, my Galaxy works well here and has NR SA connected with VoNR support when a local SIM was inserted.\n\n\nI reached Google Support in November last year and kept sending them bug reports until February this year, only to get an answer that was kind of like \"thanks for notifying us.\"\n\nAlso, I have posted to the Pixel Community about this frustrating issue, and they said that they can offer nothing since Google doesn't monitor the community.\n\nHas anyone else got the same issue? Pixel phones are really nice, and I wish I could use them everywhere rather than swapping my SIMs with my Galaxy frequently on business trips.",

I can use my cameras freely in the camera app itself, but any social media or chat app with a camera freezes if my eye gets too close to the front camera. This doesn't even make sense?? Why the eye? If I try to take a picture of my nose really close, the picture will not freeze. It will also not freeze if I try to put any other object near the front camera. Only eye or eyes up close make it freeze/crash. I tried this on a picture of a human on a maganize, and it didn't work even though I put the camera really close to the person's face. It only works if it's my face/eye, doesn't work on flat pictures.\n\nI tried updating my phone, the camera app, the social media apps, I restarted my phone many times, cleared cache, everything.

    "title": "Some games aren't working on a brand new P7 Pro. + My weeklong journey with the Pixel so far.",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: Got a brand-new and (until yesterday) factory sealed Pixel 7 Pro, three games either hang or crash immediately, despite working fine on my previous Pixel. Everything else on the phone runs perfectly afaik.\n\nEdit: I didn't really want to go through the hassle of a factory reset it DID seem to just fix these issues for me. OSRS and NIKKE both launch and run just fine now. Unlike the first time I didn't import any data from my old phone or restore any backups.\n\nThis is mostly me asking for help but I've had a bit of a journey over the last week and I might ramble a little bit before I get to my actual issue. I'm a week and two devices into my journey with the Pixel 7 Pro now, easily the most expensive phone I've ever owned and huge upgrade from my old Galaxy A50.\n\nAlmost two weeks ago I bought an 'acceptable quality' refurbished Pixel 7 Pro on Amazon for ¬£210. It arrived last Wednesday and despite a slight bit of cosmetic damage and a few minor scratches on the screen that weren't even visible when the screen was on was fairly chuffed with it, I'd spent a bit of time playing around with it's camera and all the other little features that came with it, and got to setting everything up until barely 3 hours after swiching it on when it suddenly just switched itself off at around  what should've been 65%-70% battery and refused to turn back on again, only when plugged into the wall would it power on but after barely a second on the splash screen it would immediately shut off again and just keep bootlopping from there i did manage to get into the bootloader/fastboot menu but no further from there.\n\nAbout a day later it just suddenly started working again, and I'd managed (with some power button/volume spamming, I don't even remember how) to get it into some 'no command' screen and then into android itself. I had already contacted the seller yesterday to tell them it had suddenly stopped functioning so I messaged again to update them, of course my issues didn't stop there, at random points it would once again just turn off, though unlike the first time I was able to just turn it back on again. I was incredibly suspicious of the reseller anyway as they included an M360 diagnostic report that [showed 100% battery health despite their own diagnostic report showing it had been through 1050 battery cycle](https://imgur.com/a/czQaFiS)s.\n\nBy Saturday evening I'd had enough after it did it TWICE in the span of 20 minutes at work so I got home, factory wiped it and informed the seller of my intent to return it and went shopping around for another phone, I did 'really' like the Pixel 7 from the bit of time I had with it so I went around looking at the newer Pixels and on Monday I found an Ebay listing for a brand new and sealed Pixel 7 Pro for only ¬£300 so instead I dived on that. \n\n\nIt arrived yesterday and after and after confirming it was indeed brand new and factory sealed, I let it charge to full for a few hours since it was entirely dead before switching it on for the first time, spent a bit of time getting everything setup again and updating the firmware from it's factory version of Android 13 to 16, great, everything working, I'm quite happy until try to launch a couple of the games to get them setup and properly downloaded.\n\n\n\n\n**Now my ACTUAL issue.**\n\nThree of the four games I usually have installed: Old School Runescape, Nikke and Rome Total War, all of which worked on the previous refurbed Pixel refuse to work on the new one. I'm fairly certain it's not the games themselves and I don't have a clue on why it would be the phone itself. The new phone has been fully updated and as far as I'm aware were/are both on the 1st October patch that the one I returned was on.\n\nI don't generally game on mobile so the game I do play are usually just ones I play on PC anyway and have cross-progression. If only one of them was having issues I'd just brush it off but three of the four I tested is a bit more worrisome.\n\n\n**Old School Runescape:** Will either hang on a black screen when launched before popping up a 'not responding' error or it'll simply show the app icon on said black screen and nothing more.\n\n**NIKKE:** Will get to it's load screen but stop loading at step 5/7 at exactly 57% won't progress any further.\n\n**Rome Total War:** Will launch but on the screen where it requires you to acknowledge it needs a periodic internet connection to work, tapping accept will force-close/crash the game back to homescreen.\n\n\n**Umamusume** on the other hand DOES work, I was able to get that working just fine, as far as the game's lobby screen without any issues.\n\n\nAnyone having any similar issues, problems or any possible fixes? I've tried the usual troubleshooting steps, reinstalling the apps, clearing cache/data for both the games and Google Play services, rebooting the phone but zero luck so far. Short of a factory wipe and doing all the setup again I'm not entirely certain where to go from here. I did a bit of Googling and found that last months Android update *might* be causing issues for some people across multiple different Pixel models.",

I could not figure out what to do so I restarted and my phone was working fine after that. \n\nFast forward a few hours and I am using maps again same issue. The screen in my car says couldn't connect to maps or whatever it said maps would not open on my phone and the home screen was not responding to touch although I could swipe down from the top or swipe up from the bottom just fine. I tried force closing maps but that did not work the only thing I can figure out to fix it was a reboot.\n\nPreviously I mentioned that out of nowhere the background would pop up and that was the only thing on screen no icons or nothing. I have the same brand case that I had for the other phone. Google is telling me they may have manufactured the case a little off and the edges of the case are touching the screen. Randomly my background will just pop up out of nowhere out of focus sometimes (blurry) with no icons or nothing else on the screen.

Now we‚Äôre trying to sign back into the 6a and her gmail is under family link as a child. This requires us to use her mom‚Äôs email to verify that her sign in is allowed. \n\nThe issue comes when we try to sign into her mom email on the pixel 6a it asks us for 2FA using Google prompts. The prompts wont show up anywhere on her mom‚Äôs pixel 7. \n\nI have tried soft restarts, clearing the cache of google and google play, I‚Äôve check her email and still nothing. We tried using other methods for 2FA but it kicks us back to the sign in for my little cousins email and we start the process over. \n\nWe HAVE to use my little cousins email to sign into the 6a since it was factory reset and requires the previously used email to be signed in for it to work. I‚Äôm starting to run out of ideas on how to troubleshoot this issue. My remaining ideas include factory resetting mom‚Äôs phone and/or deleting my little cousins email entirely. I‚Äôm just worried if I delete her email we won‚Äôt be able to sign into the 6a at all. \n\nIf anyone has any solutions I would greatly appreciate it! ",

At some point I have to move my esim from my current Pixel 9 Pro XL to my 3a due to accidental screen crack. I tend to do mock-up repair requests but never submit them to see what my estimate costs will look like. However, I can't do that anymore?\n\nApparently the reps I have talked to said there's no repair history for my P9P, makes sense, but because I cancelled my first repair request (I forgot to pick prepaid shipping box from google) and made another request, each one was for my 3a. Because of the multiple submissions? (Just the 2) It's causing me to error on any future repair requests somehow? Whenever I have clicked to start a repair for my P9P it just gives me \"A repair order already exists for this device. If you have questions,¬†contact us.\" \n\nWhat's weirder is when you click on the contact us from that quote, any chat sessions you request goes into a \"death loop\" meaning if I were to refresh and try to request a chat session on the computer, it'll say chat session is closed. The workaround is going to the bottom of the page and clicking that \"contact us\" link for a proper chat session to load. \n\nHas anyone ever experience this repair request wall? So far 2 reps who suggested logging out/in didn't work, and their attempts to clear that 3a cancellation repair request has yet to clear off. How is there store page that bad to do even basic repair requests??",

    "selftext": "The past few months, my Pixel 8 has randomly flickered green. Sometimes it's only a little greenish tint, sometimes it renders my phone unusable because the screen looks like green static. Through Reddit, I discovered that a gentle squeeze on the bottom of the phone would (sometimes) fix the issue, albeit temporarily. I didn't really want to continue this practice and potentially damage the phone.\n\nTwo nights ago, it was flickering, but wouldn't go back with a gentle squeeze. I put it on its charger and in the morning, it was fine, no more green. However, now there is a neon vertical line off-center to the right side of the screen that extends from the top to the bottom and does not go away. \n\nI contacted customer service yesterday and they told me that, if I could send them the invoice for the phone purchase, we could go over potential options (they told me that based on purchase date, it was out of warranty). I was at work and didn't have this proof of purchase on me, but they said I could send them the invoice at any point in the next 24 hours. I went to the local AT&T store and retrieved the invoice for the phone, then sent it along in the support chat. \n\nAt this point, the person (or bot) I was chatting with had changed names. After sending the receipt, I was informed that my only options were to either mail it to them or take it to a UBreakIFix location that was out-of-state and inconvenient for travel. I asked why they had me retrieve the invoice, and got different answers from multiple reps, including a supervisor. I believe that, ultimately, it was not necessary.\n\nHas anyone else had to jump through hoops to have this issue fixed? \n\nI'm kind of annoyed that the onus of repair is put entirely on the customer when Google is aware of this problem, which was created on their end.

I have not seen even cheap Chinese Phones with Sub INR 10k swelling up suddenly within 2 years as with this shit Pixel 7.

I'm on pixel 6.\n\nSo I read light novels with shitty ads and those ads load after the content of the page so I will regularly rush to turn on airplane mode interrupting the ads, that would otherwise make it impossible to read the page.\n\nRegularly when doing this scroll down, hit the airplane. I get a screen telling me the current weather.\n\nThe thing is. I don't know how to access that screen normally. I cannot recreate without successfully turning on airplane and usually when this happens I'm just annoyed and close it right away.\n\nSo... Got any clues on how to get to that? \n\nI thought for awhile this was a chrome feature I was unintentionally turning on but then it just happened in the play store... ",

    "title": "Long-time iOS user switched to Pixel 10 Pro XL: diagonal swipes keep turning into vertical scrolls. Anyone else? Any fixes?",
    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been on iOS for \\~15 years. I decided not to get the iPhone 17 Pro Max after feeling there wasn‚Äôt much real innovation over the last four years and jumped to a Pixel 10 Pro XL for the AI features. The phone feels legitimately powerful and I like a lot about it.\n\nOne thing is driving me nuts. When I try to swipe horizontally, a slight diagonal thumb swipe often turns into a vertical scroll. On iOS, the system seems to ‚Äúget‚Äù my intent and direction-locks to horizontal. On Android, it feels like the UI commits to vertical too easily unless my swipe is perfectly straight.\n\nWhere I see it most  \n‚Ä¢ Walmart cart screen: the horizontal suggestions under the cart love to scroll the page vertically instead of sliding sideways.  \n‚Ä¢ Amazon product pages: the horizontal ‚ÄúSponsored‚Äù product carousels often scroll the page vertically on small diagonals.  \n‚Ä¢ Messenger apps: media carousels and horizontal chips regularly misinterpret diagonals.\n\nWhat I already tried  \n‚Ä¢ Fully updated system and apps  \n‚Ä¢ Tuned back-gesture edge sensitivity  \n‚Ä¢ Turned on touch-sensitivity / screen-protector mode(Just checked it out although I have no screen protection on)  \n‚Ä¢ Temporarily used 3-button nav while testing\n\nQuestions  \n‚Ä¢ Do you see the same diagonal-to-vertical behavior on recent Pixels?  \n‚Ä¢ Any hidden settings, flags, or launcher/gesture tweaks that improve horizontal direction-locking?  \n‚Ä¢ If you moved from iOS, did this bother you at first and then fade as you adjusted your swipe angle?\n\nConstructive ask to Google/Android devs  \nPlease prioritize this. Bias the recognition toward horizontal when the initial movement suggests a sideways swipe, or give us a setting to prefer horizontal direction-lock. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is fantastic overall, but this one behavior makes you miss the ‚Äúsmooth and floating‚Äù feel that IOS has.",

I confirmed this is on Camera 10.0 AND Camera 10.1 (I got the update yesterday).\n\nIt's always been muscle memory for me to adjust the shadows a bit because I don't like the crushed shadows look. Over the past few weeks I've found it frustrating that it seems my images don't adjust the way I want it to and only last week it dawned upon me after looking at the icons more closely that the sliders are swapped compared to my Pixel 9 and older phones and I've been adjusting brightness on my Pixel 10 the first few weeks when I intended to adjust shadows.\n\nYesterday I wondered if it was a Camera 10.1 change and so I updated my Pixel 9 Pro to Camera 10.1 too. **The order stays the same on Camera 10.1 where brightness is on top on the Pixel 9 Pro**. In some further investigation I opened Pro Mode and I wonder if this is the reason--in pro mode, Shadows appears first on the Pixel 10 whereas Brightness appears first on the Pixel 9. Perhaps this order is also linked to why the sliders are swapped on the Pixel 10.\n\n**Clearing data/storage on my Pixel 10 doesn't change anything**\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n* Pixel 9 Pro on Camera 9.9 and 10.1: Brightness Top, Shadows Bottom\n\n* Pixel 10 Pro on Camera 10.0 and 10.1: Brightness Bottom, Shadows Top\n\nScreenshots: https://i.imgur.com/cbKyEhd.png",

I had no problems whatsoever. After updating to Android 16, that's where the problems started. The signal icon automatically appears with an exclamation mark (!) and no signal at all. It's ONLY fixed by restarting, but it only works for 3-5 minutes before it goes back to the same thing. No signal, no data, NOTHING. What did you do to the modem in Android 16, Google? Is this a strategy to get me to switch to a new Pixel and then do the same thing? I've tried everything: factory reset, changing SIM cards, reinstalling the software, and nothing fixes it I've seen it on different forums, and it really is a real problem affecting 4 out of 10 Pixel 8 Pro users. It's truly outrageous that Google hasn't provided a real solution, knowing full well that thousands of Pixel 8 Pro users are experiencing the SAME problem after the update. The worst part is that my warranty expired about 6 months ago, so I'm the one who loses out. I'm sure that if Google doesn't release an update that fixes the modem issue, I'll never buy another Pixel phone again.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis has been a wild ride. Today, **I finally received the official Google Camera update (v. 10.1.076.821848723.18) directly from the Play Store**.\n\nTo give you the full context:\n\n* **Oct 11th:** Google Support first told me the fix was in the (then unreleased) Oct 9th build **(10.1.076.816441313.17)**. I told them I'd test it when I received it.\n* **Oct 16th:** I experienced that bizarre \"[miracle fix](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)\" anomaly. I wrote to them again with proof, asking what was going on, and reiterated that I *still* hadn't received the update and that the manual APK *did not* work.\n* **Oct 17th:** Support replied, saying they were escalating this new 'miracle fix' info to the engineers.\n* **Oct 28th (Yesterday):** After 11 days of silence, I wrote to them again for an update. They replied, stating they were *also* still waiting for a follow-up from the engineers.\n* **Oct 29th (Today):** And then, this morning, the update finally, *officially* arrived.\n\nI immediately went to my testing spot, and unfortunately, I have to be the bearer of bad news.\n\n**The verdict: The main EIS stutter bug on the telephoto lens is 100% still there. It is NOT fixed.**\n\nYou can watch the full, new video evidence I just uploaded here: [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s)\n\n# What the Video Proves\n\nThe new test footage confirms the 5X Telephoto is still unusable (you can see the comparison with our benchmark, **OpenCamera**).\n\nIn addition to the obvious OIS/EIS conflict, I still **hypothesize that the root cause is a software limbo**: the telephoto's stabilization seems permanently stuck somewhere between the 'Standard' and 'Lock' modes. It tries to 'stick' to objects even when it shouldn't, which is what causes the 'jump' or 'stutter' when you pan. My [**new video**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s?t=22) clearly demonstrates the broken toggle.\n\n# The (Only) Good News\n\nThe *only* positive thing is that the October updates (both this one and the last one) **unlocked the ProRes 50MP feature**. (A heads-up for those who didn't know!) This now enables **100x zoom** in 50MP mode, up from the old 30x limit, and the quality is noticeably better. This is honestly how it should have worked from the start, but it's a nice find.\n\n*(P.S. This new \"failed fix\" also doesn't explain the bizarre \"miracle fix\" I experienced on* ***October 16th****, which I captured on video here:* [***ProShot and PixeCamera***](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)*. That was a separate anomaly that disappeared after a reboot.)*\n\n# I Need Your Help: A Call for Data\n\nHere's where it gets confusing. I know some users, like u/Unbreakable2k8, [reported that the APK did fix the issue for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nojbce/comment/nl41b16/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This is why I need to ask the community for help so we can gather proper statistics.\n\n**If you have a Pixel Pro/Pro XL (10, 9, 8, 7, 6) and received the OFFICIAL 10.1.076.816441313.17** or **10.1.076.821848723.18 update:**\n\n1. **What phone do you have?**\n2. **Did you get the update from the Play Store?**\n3. **Is the EIS telephoto stutter fixed for YOU?**\n\nPlease let me know in the comments. I will be compiling all of my **7 new logs** from today's failed test, my new video evidence, AND a summary of our community findings into a new, massive report for Google.\n\n**We're not giving up. Thanks, everyone.ü§ù**",

    "selftext": "So for the past 24 hours I've been trying to understand why my Google AI Plan (the Gemini and 2tb plan) wasn't included with my purchase of the Pixel 9 Pro last year, as advertised. Just to be clear, I bought the phone in January when the promotion was still active, I received the offer, but when I went to redeem the offer apparently it didn't work correctly and instead it put me on a paid plan. I wasn't paying attention, which is totally my fault, and didn't notice I was getting charged $9.99 a month for the 2tb plan, instead. The customer service agents I spoke to told me there as an error with the offer, which is why it wasn't redeemed correctly. They are also telling me too bad, and that there is nothing I can do... So apparently a glitch in their system is my fault, and they are willing to lose a customer over it. I just don't understand how we got to this point. Its clear that the many customer service reps aren't given the authority to help me, and I get that, but they can't even elevate my case to someone that can help. I am soooooo understanding of how horrible it must be to work customer service and I deal with people like this every day for my job, I know it isn't their fault. But why is Google so comfortable with losing a customer over something so trivial? I've had Pixel's since day one, been a google customer since gmail came out, and have joined Insider programs to be a part of the community... Why do they think its ok to treat customers like this after admitting it wasn't my fault?",

She told me just to hang up and call 911 right now. I did that, the same dispatcher picked up. I told her it's me again, thanks for letting me test it. She said, no problem and hung up. \n\nI think if you're very concerned about this potential issue, just call the non emergency number for your city and explain it to them. The dispatcher is more than happy to help.\n\nYou will get a prompt after you hang up that says your phone is open for emergency callback for 5 minutes. You can select the notification and dismiss this. ",

    "selftext": "I wanted to make this because so many people complain on this subreddit about the phone not being fast enough, or having the best specs, etc, etc and wanted to give my perspective as a lifelong Android user since I got my first Smartphone, which was an HTC myTouch in 2010.\n\nThe reality is, Google has moved past a specs race and enthusiast market with this phone and the past recent pixel phones, and it's evident not only in their marketing for it and how they want you to use their phone with Gemini, but also who they're targeting in general.\n\nIn the past, the phone was aimed at enthusiast and it flopped. I was one of those people, I had the OG Pixel, and the Pixel 3 XL, phones that sales wise, could be considered a failure. But the reality is that ever since the Pixel 6+ Google has moved to capturing the normies market.  \n  \nTo the people complaining about the Pixel now, I'll say what I've said in other posts talking about the phone. If you're a hardcore enthusiast, the phone isn't meant for you and is largely aimed at everyone else, and that's FINE. Other phone brands exist, and if you want the best performance for games, or the best video filming options, you have brands that you can go to, and have a way better specs for that.  \n  \nBut what the Pixel loses in some features it easily wins in others, like software smarts, or camera performance, or display quality, or speaker quality, etc etc, the list goes on.   \n  \nTo top it all off, Pixel has had year over year growth which means Google's current strategy is working, on top of it's marketing strategy, at least here in the US.\n\nTo the hardcore enthusiast, I'll say it once more, this phone isn't meant for you unless you can put up with who this phone is aimed at, the normies, and taking market share from Samsung and Apple at least in here in America, where we barely get any smartphones from the Chinese Market where the competition is non-existent.\n\nNow the deserved criticism that Google should take is regarding the software bugs that can randomly pop-up, and their horrendous customer services outsource experience. \n\nOverall Pixel is a solid phone, especially once they moved past the initial problems they had with Tensor launch, and the 7 which largely are now in the past. If you were burned by those phones and went to a different brand, I don't blame you, but past experience doesn't equate to current lineup and offers, and it's evident in the past that all phone makers have also had issues, not just Google.\n\nThis is just one mans thoughts, I'd love to hear what you all have to offer as well.

    "title": "I got the OFFICIAL Camera Update (10.1.076.821848723.18). The Verdict: THE STUTTER IS NOT FIXED.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis has been a wild ride. Today, **I finally received the official Google Camera update (v. 10.1.076.821848723.18) directly from the Play Store**.\n\nTo give you the full context:\n\n* **Oct 11th:** Google Support first told me the fix was in the (then unreleased) Oct 9th build **(10.1.076.816441313.17)**. I told them I'd test it when I received it.\n* **Oct 16th:** I experienced that bizarre \"[miracle fix](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)\" anomaly. I wrote to them again with proof, asking what was going on, and reiterated that I *still* hadn't received the update and that the manual APK *did not* work.\n* **Oct 17th:** Support replied, saying they were escalating this new 'miracle fix' info to the engineers.\n* **Oct 28th (Yesterday):** After 11 days of silence, I wrote to them again for an update. They replied, stating they were *also* still waiting for a follow-up from the engineers.\n* **Oct 29th (Today):** And then, this morning, the update finally, *officially* arrived.\n\nI immediately went to my testing spot, and unfortunately, I have to be the bearer of bad news.\n\n**The verdict: The main EIS stutter bug on the telephoto lens is 100% still there. It is NOT fixed.**\n\nYou can watch the full, new video evidence I just uploaded here: [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s)\n\n# What the Video Proves\n\nThe new test footage confirms the 5X Telephoto is still unusable (you can see the comparison with our benchmark, **OpenCamera**).\n\nIn addition to the obvious OIS/EIS conflict, I still **hypothesize that the root cause is a software limbo**: the telephoto's stabilization seems permanently stuck somewhere between the 'Standard' and 'Lock' modes. It tries to 'stick' to objects even when it shouldn't, which is what causes the 'jump' or 'stutter' when you pan. My [**new video**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s?t=22) clearly demonstrates the broken toggle.\n\n# The (Only) Good News\n\nThe *only* positive thing is that the October updates (both this one and the last one) **unlocked the ProRes 50MP feature**. (A heads-up for those who didn't know!) This now enables **100x zoom** in 50MP mode, up from the old 30x limit, and the quality is noticeably better. This is honestly how it should have worked from the start, but it's a nice find.\n\n*(P.S. This new \"failed fix\" also doesn't explain the bizarre \"miracle fix\" I experienced on* ***October 16th****, which I captured on video here:* [***ProShot and PixeCamera***](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)*. That was a separate anomaly that disappeared after a reboot.)*\n\n# I Need Your Help: A Call for Data\n\nHere's where it gets confusing. I know some users, like u/Unbreakable2k8, [reported that the APK did fix the issue for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nojbce/comment/nl41b16/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This is why I need to ask the community for help so we can gather proper statistics.\n\n**If you have a Pixel Pro/Pro XL (10, 9, 8, 7, 6) and received the OFFICIAL 10.1.076.816441313.17** or **10.1.076.821848723.18 update:**\n\n1. **What phone do you have?**\n2. **Did you get the update from the Play Store?**\n3. **Is the EIS telephoto stutter fixed for YOU?**\n\nPlease let me know in the comments. I will be compiling all of my **7 new logs** from today's failed test, my new video evidence, AND a summary of our community findings into a new, massive report for Google.\n\n**We're not giving up. Thanks, everyone.ü§ù**",

I thought changing carriers might help, but it made no difference. \n\nAnyway, recently there have been two incidents where I've needed to call 000 and my phone **can't connectivity to emergency services** because of this bug. \n\nIn Australia (and I assume most countries) your phone will select ANY available phone network it can in order to get through. This didn't happen in **both** scenarios and I'm now wondering what is the point of having a phone that cannot connect to emergency services. \n\nThe first incident happened on the 16th October: https://imgur.com/a/xCvPy9H\n\nThe next happened tonight on the 30th October: https://imgur.com/a/l36EV0X\n\nI can't even being to express my anger or frustration at the fact that Google has still not fixed this bug, which now affects emergency services.

    "selftext": "I wanted to make this because so many people complain on this subreddit about the phone not being fast enough, or having the best specs, etc, etc and wanted to give my perspective as a lifelong Android user since I got my first Smartphone, which was an HTC myTouch in 2010.\n\nThe reality is, Google has moved past a specs race and enthusiast market with this phone and the past recent pixel phones, and it's evident not only in their marketing for it and how they want you to use their phone with Gemini, but also who they're targeting in general.\n\nIn the past, the phone was aimed at enthusiast and it flopped. I was one of those people, I had the OG Pixel, and the Pixel 3 XL, phones that sales wise, could be considered a failure. But the reality is that ever since the Pixel 6+ Google has moved to capturing the normies market.  \n  \nTo the people complaining about the Pixel now, I'll say what I've said in other posts talking about the phone. If you're a hardcore enthusiast, the phone isn't meant for you and is largely aimed at everyone else, and that's FINE. Other phone brands exist, and if you want the best performance for games, or the best video filming options, you have brands that you can go to, and have a way better specs for that.  \n  \nBut what the Pixel loses in some features it easily wins in others, like software smarts, or camera performance, or display quality, or speaker quality, etc etc, the list goes on.   \n  \nTo top it all off, Pixel has had year over year growth which means Google's current strategy is working, on top of it's marketing strategy, at least here in the US.\n\nTo the hardcore enthusiast, I'll say it once more, this phone isn't meant for you unless you can put up with who this phone is aimed at, the normies, and taking market share from Samsung and Apple at least in here in America, where we barely get any smartphones from the Chinese Market where the competition is non-existent.\n\nNow the deserved criticism that Google should take is regarding the software bugs that can randomly pop-up, and their horrendous customer services outsource experience. \n\nOverall Pixel is a solid phone, especially once they moved past the initial problems they had with Tensor launch, and the 7 which largely are now in the past. If you were burned by those phones and went to a different brand, I don't blame you, but past experience doesn't equate to current lineup and offers, and it's evident in the past that all phone makers have also had issues, not just Google.\n\nThis is just one mans thoughts, I'd love to hear what you all have to offer as well.

Solution: call your city's NON emergency 911 number. The person then routed me to a dispatcher. I asked if there was a way for me to test if my phone would dial 911 properly. She told me just to hang up and call 911 right now. I did that, the same dispatcher picked up. I told her it's me again, thanks for letting me test it. She said, no problem and hung up. \n\nI think if you're very concerned about this potential issue, just call the non emergency number for your city and explain it to them. The dispatcher is more than happy to help.\n\nYou will get a prompt after you hang up that says your phone is open for emergency callback for 5 minutes. You can select the notification and dismiss this. ",

    "title": "Some games aren't working on a brand new P7 Pro. + My weeklong journey with the Pixel so far.",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: Got a brand-new and (until yesterday) factory sealed Pixel 7 Pro, three games either hang or crash immediately, despite working fine on my previous Pixel. Everything else on the phone runs perfectly afaik.\n\nEdit: I didn't really want to go through the hassle of a factory reset it DID seem to just fix these issues for me. OSRS and NIKKE both launch and run just fine now. Unlike the first time I didn't import any data from my old phone or restore any backups.\n\nThis is mostly me asking for help but I've had a bit of a journey over the last week and I might ramble a little bit before I get to my actual issue. I'm a week and two devices into my journey with the Pixel 7 Pro now, easily the most expensive phone I've ever owned and huge upgrade from my old Galaxy A50.\n\nAlmost two weeks ago I bought an 'acceptable quality' refurbished Pixel 7 Pro on Amazon for ¬£210. It arrived last Wednesday and despite a slight bit of cosmetic damage and a few minor scratches on the screen that weren't even visible when the screen was on was fairly chuffed with it, I'd spent a bit of time playing around with it's camera and all the other little features that came with it, and got to setting everything up until barely 3 hours after swiching it on when it suddenly just switched itself off at around  what should've been 65%-70% battery and refused to turn back on again, only when plugged into the wall would it power on but after barely a second on the splash screen it would immediately shut off again and just keep bootlopping from there i did manage to get into the bootloader/fastboot menu but no further from there.\n\nAbout a day later it just suddenly started working again, and I'd managed (with some power button/volume spamming, I don't even remember how) to get it into some 'no command' screen and then into android itself. I had already contacted the seller yesterday to tell them it had suddenly stopped functioning so I messaged again to update them, of course my issues didn't stop there, at random points it would once again just turn off, though unlike the first time I was able to just turn it back on again. I was incredibly suspicious of the reseller anyway as they included an M360 diagnostic report that [showed 100% battery health despite their own diagnostic report showing it had been through 1050 battery cycle](https://imgur.com/a/czQaFiS)s.\n\nBy Saturday evening I'd had enough after it did it TWICE in the span of 20 minutes at work so I got home, factory wiped it and informed the seller of my intent to return it and went shopping around for another phone, I did 'really' like the Pixel 7 from the bit of time I had with it so I went around looking at the newer Pixels and on Monday I found an Ebay listing for a brand new and sealed Pixel 7 Pro for only ¬£300 so instead I dived on that. \n\n\nIt arrived yesterday and after and after confirming it was indeed brand new and factory sealed, I let it charge to full for a few hours since it was entirely dead before switching it on for the first time, spent a bit of time getting everything setup again and updating the firmware from it's factory version of Android 13 to 16, great, everything working, I'm quite happy until try to launch a couple of the games to get them setup and properly downloaded.\n\n\n\n\n**Now my ACTUAL issue.**\n\nThree of the four games I usually have installed: Old School Runescape, Nikke and Rome Total War, all of which worked on the previous refurbed Pixel refuse to work on the new one. I'm fairly certain it's not the games themselves and I don't have a clue on why it would be the phone itself. The new phone has been fully updated and as far as I'm aware were/are both on the 1st October patch that the one I returned was on.\n\nI don't generally game on mobile so the game I do play are usually just ones I play on PC anyway and have cross-progression. If only one of them was having issues I'd just brush it off but three of the four I tested is a bit more worrisome.\n\n\n**Old School Runescape:** Will either hang on a black screen when launched before popping up a 'not responding' error or it'll simply show the app icon on said black screen and nothing more.\n\n**NIKKE:** Will get to it's load screen but stop loading at step 5/7 at exactly 57% won't progress any further.\n\n**Rome Total War:** Will launch but on the screen where it requires you to acknowledge it needs a periodic internet connection to work, tapping accept will force-close/crash the game back to homescreen.\n\n\n**Umamusume** on the other hand DOES work, I was able to get that working just fine, as far as the game's lobby screen without any issues.\n\n\nAnyone having any similar issues, problems or any possible fixes? I've tried the usual troubleshooting steps, reinstalling the apps, clearing cache/data for both the games and Google Play services, rebooting the phone but zero luck so far. Short of a factory wipe and doing all the setup again I'm not entirely certain where to go from here. I did a bit of Googling and found that last months Android update *might* be causing issues for some people across multiple different Pixel models.",

    "selftext": "I'm having the strangest problem ever. Whenever I try to use Google Pixel 9 Pro (XL) camera on any app and try to take a silly pic of my eye really close (so the pic is slightly blurry) the camera will freeze. If I do it few times in a row, the whole phone will randomly reboot?? I can use my cameras freely in the camera app itself, but any social media or chat app with a camera freezes if my eye gets too close to the front camera. This doesn't even make sense?? Why the eye? If I try to take a picture of my nose really close, the picture will not freeze. It will also not freeze if I try to put any other object near the front camera. Only eye or eyes up close make it freeze/crash. I tried this on a picture of a human on a maganize, and it didn't work even though I put the camera really close to the person's face. It only works if it's my face/eye, doesn't work on flat pictures.\n\nI tried updating my phone, the camera app, the social media apps, I restarted my phone many times, cleared cache, everything. What could cause something like this? The phone is not overheating, battery capacity at 90%, should have enough storage available.\n\nEvery day I regret getting this phone more and more. I can't even use the front camera freely anymore. ",

It was only about a year old I traded it in and got the Pixel 10 Pro XL.\n\nI have a screen in my car that does Android auto and it has been working fine ever since I got it. Today it is saying an error message of some sort could not connect to maps or something.  My phone would not open maps either and icons on my home screen we're not responding to my touch. I could not figure out what to do so I restarted and my phone was working fine after that. \n\nFast forward a few hours and I am using maps again same issue. The screen in my car says couldn't connect to maps or whatever it said maps would not open on my phone and the home screen was not responding to touch although I could swipe down from the top or swipe up from the bottom just fine. I tried force closing maps but that did not work the only thing I can figure out to fix it was a reboot.\n\nPreviously I mentioned that out of nowhere the background would pop up and that was the only thing on screen no icons or nothing. I have the same brand case that I had for the other phone. Google is telling me they may have manufactured the case a little off and the edges of the case are touching the screen. Randomly my background will just pop up out of nowhere out of focus sometimes (blurry) with no icons or nothing else on the screen. I thought it was me pressing something by accident but I can't recreate it it just randomly happens. \n\n",

Over the past few weeks I've found it frustrating that it seems my images don't adjust the way I want it to and only last week it dawned upon me after looking at the icons more closely that the sliders are swapped compared to my Pixel 9 and older phones and I've been adjusting brightness on my Pixel 10 the first few weeks when I intended to adjust shadows.\n\nYesterday I wondered if it was a Camera 10.1 change and so I updated my Pixel 9 Pro to Camera 10.1 too. **The order stays the same on Camera 10.1 where brightness is on top on the Pixel 9 Pro**. In some further investigation I opened Pro Mode and I wonder if this is the reason--in pro mode, Shadows appears first on the Pixel 10 whereas Brightness appears first on the Pixel 9. Perhaps this order is also linked to why the sliders are swapped on the Pixel 10.\n\n**Clearing data/storage on my Pixel 10 doesn't change anything**\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n* Pixel 9 Pro on Camera 9.9 and 10.1: Brightness Top, Shadows Bottom\n\n* Pixel 10 Pro on Camera 10.0 and 10.1: Brightness Bottom, Shadows Top\n\nScreenshots: https://i.imgur.com/cbKyEhd.png",

    "title": "I got the OFFICIAL Camera Update (10.1.076.821848723.18). The Verdict: THE STUTTER IS NOT FIXED.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis has been a wild ride. Today, **I finally received the official Google Camera update (v. 10.1.076.821848723.18) directly from the Play Store**.\n\nTo give you the full context:\n\n* **Oct 11th:** Google Support first told me the fix was in the (then unreleased) Oct 9th build **(10.1.076.816441313.17)**. I told them I'd test it when I received it.\n* **Oct 16th:** I experienced that bizarre \"[miracle fix](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)\" anomaly. I wrote to them again with proof, asking what was going on, and reiterated that I *still* hadn't received the update and that the manual APK *did not* work.\n* **Oct 17th:** Support replied, saying they were escalating this new 'miracle fix' info to the engineers.\n* **Oct 28th (Yesterday):** After 11 days of silence, I wrote to them again for an update. They replied, stating they were *also* still waiting for a follow-up from the engineers.\n* **Oct 29th (Today):** And then, this morning, the update finally, *officially* arrived.\n\nI immediately went to my testing spot, and unfortunately, I have to be the bearer of bad news.\n\n**The verdict: The main EIS stutter bug on the telephoto lens is 100% still there. It is NOT fixed.**\n\nYou can watch the full, new video evidence I just uploaded here: [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s)\n\n# What the Video Proves\n\nThe new test footage confirms the 5X Telephoto is still unusable (you can see the comparison with our benchmark, **OpenCamera**).\n\nIn addition to the obvious OIS/EIS conflict, I still **hypothesize that the root cause is a software limbo**: the telephoto's stabilization seems permanently stuck somewhere between the 'Standard' and 'Lock' modes. It tries to 'stick' to objects even when it shouldn't, which is what causes the 'jump' or 'stutter' when you pan. My [**new video**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s?t=22) clearly demonstrates the broken toggle.\n\n# The (Only) Good News\n\nThe *only* positive thing is that the October updates (both this one and the last one) **unlocked the ProRes 50MP feature**. (A heads-up for those who didn't know!) This now enables **100x zoom** in 50MP mode, up from the old 30x limit, and the quality is noticeably better. This is honestly how it should have worked from the start, but it's a nice find.\n\n*(P.S. This new \"failed fix\" also doesn't explain the bizarre \"miracle fix\" I experienced on* ***October 16th****, which I captured on video here:* [***ProShot and PixeCamera***](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)*. That was a separate anomaly that disappeared after a reboot.)*\n\n# I Need Your Help: A Call for Data\n\nHere's where it gets confusing. I know some users, like u/Unbreakable2k8, [reported that the APK did fix the issue for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nojbce/comment/nl41b16/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This is why I need to ask the community for help so we can gather proper statistics.\n\n**If you have a Pixel Pro/Pro XL (10, 9, 8, 7, 6) and received the OFFICIAL 10.1.076.816441313.17** or **10.1.076.821848723.18 update:**\n\n1. **What phone do you have?**\n2. **Did you get the update from the Play Store?**\n3. **Is the EIS telephoto stutter fixed for YOU?**\n\nPlease let me know in the comments. I will be compiling all of my **7 new logs** from today's failed test, my new video evidence, AND a summary of our community findings into a new, massive report for Google.\n\n**We're not giving up. Thanks, everyone.ü§ù**",

This is in areas where there is strong 4G & 5G signals around the area that has no signal. \n\nBuying the Pixel 10 pro, I knew it would have this same bug as Google doesn't care to fix the issue. I thought changing carriers might help, but it made no difference. \n\nAnyway, recently there have been two incidents where I've needed to call 000 and my phone **can't connectivity to emergency services** because of this bug. \n\nIn Australia (and I assume most countries) your phone will select ANY available phone network it can in order to get through. This didn't happen in **both** scenarios and I'm now wondering what is the point of having a phone that cannot connect to emergency services. \n\nThe first incident happened on the 16th October: https://imgur.com/a/xCvPy9H\n\nThe next happened tonight on the 30th October: https://imgur.com/a/l36EV0X\n\nI can't even being to express my anger or frustration at the fact that Google has still not fixed this bug, which now affects emergency services. I've raised feedback through the settings app 100s of times. Enough is enough Google - sort it out! ",

I was one of those people, I had the OG Pixel, and the Pixel 3 XL, phones that sales wise, could be considered a failure. But the reality is that ever since the Pixel 6+ Google has moved to capturing the normies market.  \n  \nTo the people complaining about the Pixel now, I'll say what I've said in other posts talking about the phone. If you're a hardcore enthusiast, the phone isn't meant for you and is largely aimed at everyone else, and that's FINE. Other phone brands exist, and if you want the best performance for games, or the best video filming options, you have brands that you can go to, and have a way better specs for that.  \n  \nBut what the Pixel loses in some features it easily wins in others, like software smarts, or camera performance, or display quality, or speaker quality, etc etc, the list goes on.   \n  \nTo top it all off, Pixel has had year over year growth which means Google's current strategy is working, on top of it's marketing strategy, at least here in the US.\n\nTo the hardcore enthusiast, I'll say it once more, this phone isn't meant for you unless you can put up with who this phone is aimed at, the normies, and taking market share from Samsung and Apple at least in here in America, where we barely get any smartphones from the Chinese Market where the competition is non-existent.\n\nNow the deserved criticism that Google should take is regarding the software bugs that can randomly pop-up, and their horrendous customer services outsource experience. \n\nOverall Pixel is a solid phone, especially once they moved past the initial problems they had with Tensor launch, and the 7 which largely are now in the past. If you were burned by those phones and went to a different brand, I don't blame you, but past experience doesn't equate to current lineup and offers, and it's evident in the past that all phone makers have also had issues, not just Google.\n\nThis is just one mans thoughts, I'd love to hear what you all have to offer as well.

    "selftext": "Hey all\n\n  \nI have been trying to find the solution that fixes this problem with no luck.\n\nI bought a PW2 second hand, and the previous owner says he deleted it from his devices. He says the watch app still asks him to pair the watch when he opens it. I am unable to log into it, even after a factory reset, because it is asking for his last swipe password. I have given him directions to remove it from devices, he says it is done already. I don't know what to tell him to do at this point to get this to work. \n\n  \nPlease give me any and all advice you have that might actually work",

    "selftext": "I just want to reiterate what discussed in many other posts, the Anker Zolo wireless charger will not work properly with your Pixel 10. It will charge your phone once but then you will need to unplug it from the wall to make it work again. So if you charge your phone overnight it'll hit full battery (or 80%) and then start depleting from them because it won't turn on again. It is a real pity because it's competitively priced and really reanic nice.\nSo yeah, if you have a Pixel 10 buy something else.",

    "selftext": "Hello there, I'm new to Reddit and I want to make some comments about my negative experience with Pixel phones, specifically regarding poor telephony availability. I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced the same issue.\n\nI've been a Pixel user since the good old days of the Pixel 3 XL, and the phone was working fine most of the time. The next Pixel I got was the Pixel 8 Pro, then the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and now I've got my shiny new Pixel 10 Pro XL.\n\nI will have to go on business trips to Chinese Mainland from time to time. Actually I am here for the Canton Fair right now.\n\n\nHere's the problem:\n\nThe phone has VoLTE and VoNR support in Hong Kong SAR with a local SIM from 3HK or roaming with my TWM SIM.\n\nPixels can connect to LTE for Internet access, but without VoLTE and VoNR support in Chinese Mainland with both my local SIMs from China Mobile and China Telecom.\n\nInterestingly, my Galaxy works well here and has NR SA connected with VoNR support when a local SIM was inserted.\n\n\nI reached Google Support in November last year and kept sending them bug reports until February this year, only to get an answer that was kind of like \"thanks for notifying us.\"\n\nAlso, I have posted to the Pixel Community about this frustrating issue, and they said that they can offer nothing since Google doesn't monitor the community.\n\nHas anyone else got the same issue? Pixel phones are really nice, and I wish I could use them everywhere rather than swapping my SIMs with my Galaxy frequently on business trips.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "title": "My Unlocked S25 Ultra from BestBuy Disabled After 6 Months",
    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I‚Äôm absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I‚Äôm there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this sound bar isn‚Äôt quite on the same level as my old system was, but it‚Äôs probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

I absolutely love it, i put it on the wall and its nicely up there.\n\nMy only concern is, the 2 top screws only screwed in a few turns before becoming tight. No cross thread as I pulled it out and did it again on both 2 or 3 times to be certain.\n\nHas anyone else found that the thread depth isn't very deep on the top 2 screws for mounting?\n\nConsidering taking it down and quadruple checking but wanting to leave it.\n\nIts been 24 hours now, no movement so want to leave it on the wall but the anxiety in the back of my mind tells me otherwise. I fear ill keep going in circles and eventually ruin it myself.\n\nMake me feel better please haha.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn.

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

It's bad enough Uncle Terry opens a meta product on his phone and gets brainwashed by technocrats but now they want the lying machine persistently on people's lock screen? Really? ",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "Hello guys!   \nI know there's a lot of those topics, but it seems that my case is a bit different.   \n  \nSo this January I bought brand new GW5pro  (manufactured at the end of 2023)  from a local chain - updated it to the latest firmware  at the time and used it happily, getting at least 60h of battery life (72 in better days)  with no restrictions, using it like a smart watch - bunch of notifications, constant pulse tracking, GPS activities like running or bicycle, gym exercise tracking, sleep tracking. I used mostly stock apps and watch faces, aside from Spotify maybe. \n\nThen, at the end of September at some point it died on me unexpectedly - clocking in less than 24h from full charge, and battery never got as good as before ever since. \n\nI did all the obvious stuff - cleared cache, done a reset, updated and reinstalled everything, set it up from scratch without restoring backup.  Since it's still under warranty - I reached to the Samsung service, 3 times in total. First they diagnosed it and done a full reset - issue remained. Then I returned it to the store, they sent it to the same Service Center, for them to do another reset, with no result. \n\nThen I reached out to local Samsung support, and they advised to take it back to the service once more - then, when service diagnosed it yet again ('no issues found') - I pressed with my story, and as a part of keeping me loyal, they changes the watch battery and a back plate, returning it to me with stock firmware (one ui 4.5) - I updated it again, and guess what? The watch barely hangs for 30hours from charge to charge. \n\nNothing has changes in my use patterns, no 3rd party apps (aside from Spotify occasionally) were draining battery. My phone (s24U) is doing perfectly fine while the watch does this BS. \n\n*TLDR: Bought a new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro with great battery life (60-72 hours). In September, it suddenly dropped to under 24 hours. Despite multiple resets and a warranty repair where Samsung replaced the battery, the problem persists, now lasting only about 30 hours. No changes in usage patterns.*\n\nThank you for everyone who got this through.  Any ideas on how to fix this? Maybe someone had similar issues? ",

For example, if I open the heart rate app on the watch and scroll to the bottom and click the ‚Äúshow on phone‚Äù button, it gives an error saying ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt open Samsung health on phone‚Äù with a question mark next to the Bluetooth icon in the middle of watch icon and phone icon- however the Bluetooth is definitely connected. \n\nTried all the different suggestions online, clear  cache / data for the app, reset the watch and reconnect, update all the softwares and firmwares, sync to Samsung account, etc. None of them worked. \n\nAny thoughts what could be wrong and how to fix it? Quite frustrating for not being able to make such a basic function to work. Thanks. ",

I had to get a new watch because something shredded under my bezel and everytime I'd spin it, something black or clear would work it's way from under the bezel. I'd had it for like 2ish years so I def got my money's worth and I def put a ton of miles on that little bezel, so I'm not surprised. I ordered a Watch 6 Classic (love that bezel, baby!) refurbished from Amazon, just like I did with my Watch 4. \n\nMy concern: I tried to spin the bezel on the Watch 6 Classic and it is significantly tighter. Like, I cannot spin with one finger like I did my old watch. I HAVE to use 2 or 3 fingers and press down a little (insert joke here). My question is, is that normal? Do I need to just wear it loose or is it a defect with the watch and I need to get a replacement? Is the too-tight a feature or a bug? \n\nTL;DR: Watch 6 Classic bezel is tighter than my wife, do I need a new one? ",

But I'm not reading very good things about the battery.\n\nI am mostly interested in health (ecg, sleep) and sports (mainly pool and open water swimming and running, 4-5 times a week) tracking. I already have had several smart watches and never used calling/messaging etc and never used AOD.\n\nMy question is, is there someone out there using the watch like this, more like a Garmin let's say (which I don't consider as an option because I don't like the designs and they're way more expensive here than W8)? What kind of battery life can I expect?\n\nAs I'm using a Huawei, which I charge like every 10 days or so I guess, charging daily would be a nightmare!\n\nThanks in advance..",

I have all permissions allowed on both phone and watch. For some reason the Galaxy wearable app has notifications turned off and I'm unable to turn them on. I've tried restarting both phone and watch. Even deleted the app. I've included images of what I'm seeing. I also accidentally removed permission on my one plus 13 phone for the Galaxy wearable app for device app and notification, but I can't find any way to give it permission back. Any help is appreciated.",

However when I did this, I found that I could no longer download any apps onto the watch. Whenever I go into the Galaxy Store on the watch, it just doesn't display any app results whatsoever- I click the recommended tab, 'no results'. I search for a specific app, 'no results'. Watch faces still appear when searched and can be downloaded, but no apps. I looked online, saw a tip to restart both devices, which I did to no help. Then another tip to factory reset the watch and connect it again, which again I did and it didn't help. I understand the watch is old but its worked absolutely fine connected to my old A54, so what changed? If anyone has the solution to this problem it would be appreciated. \n\nP.s. sorry the screenshots are in Polish, but it just essentially says 'no results' as I stated above.",

Now four weeks out I'm above 50%.  Charging times have been correspondingly reduced.  The only change I can think of is being totally dissatisfied with Samsung Health exporting data I've limited what it exports, but it's still exporting heart rate 24/7, and I think that gets sent to the phone even without using Samsung Health at all.\n\nHave others notice similar significant changes in battery drain?\n\nEdit:  I should have knocked wood after posting. Today it was down to 18% which hasn't happened since the first week.  No unusual uses yesterday.",

    "selftext": "So...... my phone (S21 Ultra) took a dive in a swimming pool.   I caught it before it hit bottom, immediately turned it off, and hung it ports down above a fan (I read that it will dry better in open air than in rice), but it's not looking good.   It may have been water resistant enough to survive a quick dunk when it was new, but the years apparently degraded that.   It's been hanging above the fan for 5 days and counting, and this morning it still wouldn't turn on, and when I plug it in it shows the charging icon for about 3 seconds, then nothing.\n\nSo why am I telling you this in r/GalaxyWatch ?    Because I got an S25 Ultra to replace it, but I had to reset my GW3 to connect it to the S25 Ultra, and I lost my favorite watchface (pay no attention to the 8% battery.... I stole someone else's picture of the watchface.)\n\nI'd thought a little about upgrading the GW3, but it's about 32nd on the list, since the GW3 still does everything I want it to do.   With support for Tizen ending, I may need to move it up on my list?\n\nSo I'm wondering if the Bluestealth watchface (or something very like it) is available for newer Galaxy watches?\n\nI still have my OG Galaxy Watch in a drawer, I haven't reset it, and it still has the Bluestealth watchface.   Is there any way to recover the watchface from the OG GW to the GW3 to at least tide me over until I decide to upgrade to a newer watch?",

    "selftext": "Hello guys!   \nI know there's a lot of those topics, but it seems that my case is a bit different.   \n  \nSo this January I bought brand new GW5pro  (manufactured at the end of 2023)  from a local chain - updated it to the latest firmware  at the time and used it happily, getting at least 60h of battery life (72 in better days)  with no restrictions, using it like a smart watch - bunch of notifications, constant pulse tracking, GPS activities like running or bicycle, gym exercise tracking, sleep tracking. I used mostly stock apps and watch faces, aside from Spotify maybe. \n\nThen, at the end of September at some point it died on me unexpectedly - clocking in less than 24h from full charge, and battery never got as good as before ever since. \n\nI did all the obvious stuff - cleared cache, done a reset, updated and reinstalled everything, set it up from scratch without restoring backup.  Since it's still under warranty - I reached to the Samsung service, 3 times in total. First they diagnosed it and done a full reset - issue remained. Then I returned it to the store, they sent it to the same Service Center, for them to do another reset, with no result. \n\nThen I reached out to local Samsung support, and they advised to take it back to the service once more - then, when service diagnosed it yet again ('no issues found') - I pressed with my story, and as a part of keeping me loyal, they changes the watch battery and a back plate, returning it to me with stock firmware (one ui 4.5) - I updated it again, and guess what? The watch barely hangs for 30hours from charge to charge. \n\nNothing has changes in my use patterns, no 3rd party apps (aside from Spotify occasionally) were draining battery. My phone (s24U) is doing perfectly fine while the watch does this BS. \n\n*TLDR: Bought a new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro with great battery life (60-72 hours). In September, it suddenly dropped to under 24 hours. Despite multiple resets and a warranty repair where Samsung replaced the battery, the problem persists, now lasting only about 30 hours. No changes in usage patterns.*\n\nThank you for everyone who got this through.  Any ideas on how to fix this? Maybe someone had similar issues? ",

I had to get a new watch because something shredded under my bezel and everytime I'd spin it, something black or clear would work it's way from under the bezel. I'd had it for like 2ish years so I def got my money's worth and I def put a ton of miles on that little bezel, so I'm not surprised. I ordered a Watch 6 Classic (love that bezel, baby!) refurbished from Amazon, just like I did with my Watch 4. \n\nMy concern: I tried to spin the bezel on the Watch 6 Classic and it is significantly tighter. Like, I cannot spin with one finger like I did my old watch. I HAVE to use 2 or 3 fingers and press down a little (insert joke here). My question is, is that normal? Do I need to just wear it loose or is it a defect with the watch and I need to get a replacement? Is the too-tight a feature or a bug? \n\nTL;DR: Watch 6 Classic bezel is tighter than my wife, do I need a new one? ",

However, upon seeing it in person, I thought it was too bulky for me and my usage profile.\n\nSo even if the design is less attractive (for me obviously), I'm now considering Watch 8 (non LTE version). But I'm not reading very good things about the battery.\n\nI am mostly interested in health (ecg, sleep) and sports (mainly pool and open water swimming and running, 4-5 times a week) tracking. I already have had several smart watches and never used calling/messaging etc and never used AOD.\n\nMy question is, is there someone out there using the watch like this, more like a Garmin let's say (which I don't consider as an option because I don't like the designs and they're way more expensive here than W8)? What kind of battery life can I expect?\n\nAs I'm using a Huawei, which I charge like every 10 days or so I guess, charging daily would be a nightmare!\n\nThanks in advance..",

I have all permissions allowed on both phone and watch. For some reason the Galaxy wearable app has notifications turned off and I'm unable to turn them on. I've tried restarting both phone and watch. Even deleted the app. I've included images of what I'm seeing. I also accidentally removed permission on my one plus 13 phone for the Galaxy wearable app for device app and notification, but I can't find any way to give it permission back. Any help is appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Trying to setup up the Galaxy Watch 7 with my moto razr. The watch is connected, the Galaxy Wearables app is working fine, the Samsung Health app also shows the watch is connected, but just cannot sync data over.  \n\nThe problem appears to be two-way: the Samsung Health app cannot retrieve data from the watch; the watch also cannot open the app on the phone. For example, if I open the heart rate app on the watch and scroll to the bottom and click the ‚Äúshow on phone‚Äù button, it gives an error saying ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt open Samsung health on phone‚Äù with a question mark next to the Bluetooth icon in the middle of watch icon and phone icon- however the Bluetooth is definitely connected. \n\nTried all the different suggestions online, clear  cache / data for the app, reset the watch and reconnect, update all the softwares and firmwares, sync to Samsung account, etc. None of them worked. \n\nAny thoughts what could be wrong and how to fix it? Quite frustrating for not being able to make such a basic function to work. Thanks. ",

Watch faces still appear when searched and can be downloaded, but no apps. I looked online, saw a tip to restart both devices, which I did to no help. Then another tip to factory reset the watch and connect it again, which again I did and it didn't help. I understand the watch is old but its worked absolutely fine connected to my old A54, so what changed?

    "selftext": "Hello guys!   \nI know there's a lot of those topics, but it seems that my case is a bit different.   \n  \nSo this January I bought brand new GW5pro  (manufactured at the end of 2023)  from a local chain - updated it to the latest firmware  at the time and used it happily, getting at least 60h of battery life (72 in better days)  with no restrictions, using it like a smart watch - bunch of notifications, constant pulse tracking, GPS activities like running or bicycle, gym exercise tracking, sleep tracking. I used mostly stock apps and watch faces, aside from Spotify maybe. \n\nThen, at the end of September at some point it died on me unexpectedly - clocking in less than 24h from full charge, and battery never got as good as before ever since. \n\nI did all the obvious stuff - cleared cache, done a reset, updated and reinstalled everything, set it up from scratch without restoring backup.  Since it's still under warranty - I reached to the Samsung service, 3 times in total. First they diagnosed it and done a full reset - issue remained. Then I returned it to the store, they sent it to the same Service Center, for them to do another reset, with no result. \n\nThen I reached out to local Samsung support, and they advised to take it back to the service once more - then, when service diagnosed it yet again ('no issues found') - I pressed with my story, and as a part of keeping me loyal, they changes the watch battery and a back plate, returning it to me with stock firmware (one ui 4.5) - I updated it again, and guess what? The watch barely hangs for 30hours from charge to charge. \n\nNothing has changes in my use patterns, no 3rd party apps (aside from Spotify occasionally) were draining battery. My phone (s24U) is doing perfectly fine while the watch does this BS. \n\n*TLDR: Bought a new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro with great battery life (60-72 hours). In September, it suddenly dropped to under 24 hours. Despite multiple resets and a warranty repair where Samsung replaced the battery, the problem persists, now lasting only about 30 hours. No changes in usage patterns.*\n\nThank you for everyone who got this through.  Any ideas on how to fix this? Maybe someone had similar issues? ",

I had to get a new watch because something shredded under my bezel and everytime I'd spin it, something black or clear would work it's way from under the bezel. I'd had it for like 2ish years so I def got my money's worth and I def put a ton of miles on that little bezel, so I'm not surprised. I ordered a Watch 6 Classic (love that bezel, baby!) refurbished from Amazon, just like I did with my Watch 4. \n\nMy concern: I tried to spin the bezel on the Watch 6 Classic and it is significantly tighter. Like, I cannot spin with one finger like I did my old watch. I HAVE to use 2 or 3 fingers and press down a little (insert joke here). My question is, is that normal? Do I need to just wear it loose or is it a defect with the watch and I need to get a replacement? Is the too-tight a feature or a bug? \n\nTL;DR: Watch 6 Classic bezel is tighter than my wife, do I need a new one? ",

However, upon seeing it in person, I thought it was too bulky for me and my usage profile.\n\nSo even if the design is less attractive (for me obviously), I'm now considering Watch 8 (non LTE version). But I'm not reading very good things about the battery.\n\nI am mostly interested in health (ecg, sleep) and sports (mainly pool and open water swimming and running, 4-5 times a week) tracking. I already have had several smart watches and never used calling/messaging etc and never used AOD.\n\nMy question is, is there someone out there using the watch like this, more like a Garmin let's say (which I don't consider as an option because I don't like the designs and they're way more expensive here than W8)? What kind of battery life can I expect?\n\nAs I'm using a Huawei, which I charge like every 10 days or so I guess, charging daily would be a nightmare!\n\nThanks in advance..",

I have all permissions allowed on both phone and watch. For some reason the Galaxy wearable app has notifications turned off and I'm unable to turn them on. I've tried restarting both phone and watch. Even deleted the app. I've included images of what I'm seeing. I also accidentally removed permission on my one plus 13 phone for the Galaxy wearable app for device app and notification, but I can't find any way to give it permission back. Any help is appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Trying to setup up the Galaxy Watch 7 with my moto razr. The watch is connected, the Galaxy Wearables app is working fine, the Samsung Health app also shows the watch is connected, but just cannot sync data over.  \n\nThe problem appears to be two-way: the Samsung Health app cannot retrieve data from the watch; the watch also cannot open the app on the phone. For example, if I open the heart rate app on the watch and scroll to the bottom and click the ‚Äúshow on phone‚Äù button, it gives an error saying ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt open Samsung health on phone‚Äù with a question mark next to the Bluetooth icon in the middle of watch icon and phone icon- however the Bluetooth is definitely connected. \n\nTried all the different suggestions online, clear  cache / data for the app, reset the watch and reconnect, update all the softwares and firmwares, sync to Samsung account, etc. None of them worked. \n\nAny thoughts what could be wrong and how to fix it? Quite frustrating for not being able to make such a basic function to work. Thanks. ",

Loved how light, quiet, and cool it was when I lugged it around campus or traveled weekly, but I don't do either of those anymore and, even though I still use it every day, it needs a couple replacement parts (battery + keyboard = $100-125-ish) to be its best self and it's not Win11 compatible, so it's time to look forward...\n\nBecause I don't need the new laptop to be what this one was, I am setting a much lower budget for myself this time around: **$500**\n\nHome use, mostly browsing from the couch/recliner and/or when I don't want to move 20 feet to use the desktop. No actual gaming. May watch a movie on it once a year if/when I travel. 10-key not needed for any sort of data entry. Thinking 14\"-15\" but open to 13\"-16\" if better for current/projected use case. Again, loved the X1C being 2.5 lbs (big difference from the 17\" 6-lb behemoth I had before it), but somewhere in between is fine. Love the X1C's keyboard. Cannot stand mushy keys.\n\nWould like to be able to upgrade RAM (my X1C's is soldered to the mobo). Would like it to be Win11 compatible. I'm in the US.\n\nOpen to everything from a refurb X1C Gen9 for \\~$400 to a new \"lower\" model or different brand entirely.\n\nThoughts? Recos? Brands/models to definitely stay away from?

If indifferent, put N/A.\\\nBetween 14 and 16 inches is fine.\n\nAre you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\\\nYes ‚Äî light photo/video editing (Photoshop, Premiere basics) and gaming in free time.\n\nIf you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\\\nModern AAA games at 1080p, mix of high/mid (sometimes low) settings, around 60‚Äì70 FPS.\n\nAny specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\\\nGood keyboard, decent color accuracy (sRGB) for studying/editing, reliable thermals, and MUX switch / Adv Optimus if possible.\n\nLeave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\\\nI really liked the Lenovo LOQ lineup at first, but I‚Äôve read about motherboard issues on some 2024 units, which worries me since I won‚Äôt have warranty coverage.\nI‚Äôm mainly considering **RTX 4050 / 4060** laptops. The **RTX 30-series** is quite old and hard to find both in the UAE and Iran, and **RTX 5050** is just being introduced ‚Äî close to my budget, though discounts on it are likely to be limited for now.\\\nSince I‚Äôll often use it on battery for light work, I‚Äôd prefer a CPU with a strong enough iGPU (so not something like **Ryzen 7 7435HS** that doesn't have any iGPU).\\\nMy goal is to find a reliable, well-balanced laptop that will last 3‚Äì4 years and handle both gaming and student work smoothly.\n\n\nFor context ‚Äî I‚Äôm a nursing student, and the average monthly income** for a newly graduated nurse working in a hospital here is about **20 million Toman** (Iran currency) (~680 AED , ~180 USD).\nThat means my 100M Toman budget equals roughly **5 months** of a nurse‚Äôs early-career salary, so I really can‚Äôt stretch it any further.\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions or reliability feedback! üôè",

My GPU seems to be on the higher-end when compared to similar form-factor laptops, but falls short, obviously, when compared to more gaming/workstation laptops. I know battery wise it's gonna be a mixed bag but I ditching WIndows for Debian will probably fix it (just like it fixed mine).\n\nAre there specific models I should be on the lookout for? I'd prefer avoiding Legions and extremely heavy laptops like it, but I could make exceptions for more \"professional\" level ones of similar weight. I've heard about the HP ZBooks, Dell Precisions and some newer ish Thinkpads, but I want more opinions.\n\n  \nThanks!",

I‚Äôm not a gamer or a tech expert ‚Äî just a casual player who wants a solid, future-proof laptop that will last for several years.\n\nI‚Äôll mostly use it on weekends, not daily, but I still want good performance and build quality for the price.\n\nI‚Äôm deciding between these two options:\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüíª Lenovo IdeaPad Slim (around 4100 PLN)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAMD Ryzen 7 8845HS (8 cores / 16 threads, up to 5.1 GHz)\n\t‚Ä¢\tRadeon 780M integrated graphics\n\t‚Ä¢\t24 GB DDR5 RAM\n\t‚Ä¢\t1 TB SSD\n\t‚Ä¢\t16‚Äù IPS 1920x1200, 60 Hz, matte\n\t‚Ä¢\tBattery: up to 14h, 50 Wh\n\t‚Ä¢\tWeight: 1.81 kg\n\t‚Ä¢\tAluminum build, military-grade durability\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüíª HP Victus (around 4000 PLN)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIntel Core 5 210H (8 cores / 12 threads, up to 4.8 GHz)\n\t‚Ä¢\tNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB\n\t‚Ä¢\t32 GB DDR5 RAM\n\t‚Ä¢\t1 TB SSD\n\t‚Ä¢\t15.6‚Äù IPS 1920x1080, 144 Hz\n\t‚Ä¢\tBattery: 70 Wh\n\t‚Ä¢\tWeight: 2.29 kg\n\t‚Ä¢\tDedicated GPU, G-Sync, DLSS 4 support\n\n‚∏ª\n\nI‚Äôm torn between the two. Lenovo has a sleek aluminum body, a bigger screen, and great build quality ‚Äî but the HP has a dedicated GPU and more RAM, which might help with Sims performance.\n\nWhat do you think? Which one would be better for my use case?\n",

    "selftext": "I travel for work a lot and want to game when I'm on the road but gaming laptops seem like you're always compromising. Desktop replacements with RTX 4070 or higher are like 2000+ and weigh 7 pounds which defeats the purpose of a laptop. Thinner gaming laptops with RTX 4060 are more portable but then you're not really getting great performance for the money. Battery life on all of them sucks, most reviews say 3-4 hours max doing normal stuff and way less gaming. I mainly play stuff like Elden Ring and whatever new releases come out, want to run things at high settings 1080p minimum. If Black Friday drops a good gaming laptop to like 1400-1600 I'd bite but I'm worried about buying something that's underpowered or will have thermal issues.\n\nHas anyone regretted buying a gaming laptop instead of just getting a desktop and using a regular laptop for travel? And do gaming laptops have real Black Friday deals or just the same prices with inflated MSRPs to make discounts look bigger?",

Was kinda boring with Windows 11.\n\nCouple of days later (after speaking with a friend - he wanted to buy it from me) I got a MacBook Air M4. What a piece of machinery! Slick, compact, so beautiful and the OS seemed so nice...until I actually started using it.\n\nWTF is Apple doing with its software... is this supposed to be easy to use? Even Linux has far better usability. I installed all kinds of apps to make it behave properly, like actually close the App with X, then make the windows maximize by clicking on the title and lots, lots more. I searched in Homebrew, made all kind of changes, but it felt too unintuitive. The cooperation with AirPods & iPhone is perfect, but the OS itself is a mess.\n\nSpoke with my friend again, he said he wants that too. I told him he can get only 1 and he said I can give him which I don't need. So last night, I set up the Windows Laptop again, after 3 days of weirdness of the macOS, I feel like using an OS that makes sense. Today is the day he gets the MacBook. I wish him luck as he never used a Mac.",

    "title": "Gaming laptop Black Friday 2025 deals search, desktop performance vs portability compromise",
    "selftext": "I travel for work a lot and want to game when I'm on the road but gaming laptops seem like you're always compromising. Desktop replacements with RTX 4070 or higher are like 2000+ and weigh 7 pounds which defeats the purpose of a laptop. Thinner gaming laptops with RTX 4060 are more portable but then you're not really getting great performance for the money. Battery life on all of them sucks, most reviews say 3-4 hours max doing normal stuff and way less gaming. I mainly play stuff like Elden Ring and whatever new releases come out, want to run things at high settings 1080p minimum. If Black Friday drops a good gaming laptop to like 1400-1600 I'd bite but I'm worried about buying something that's underpowered or will have thermal issues.\n\nHas anyone regretted buying a gaming laptop instead of just getting a desktop and using a regular laptop for travel? And do gaming laptops have real Black Friday deals or just the same prices with inflated MSRPs to make discounts look bigger?",

All this time I had a work laptop that is locked to the bone and my main device is an iPhone 13PM, and I did it all there, movies, YouTube, etc.\n\nSo I got an Asus Zenbook 14\" Ryzen AI 7 350 / 32GB RAM/ OLED Screen, set it up, installed VS Code/VS Studio and some other apps. Was kinda boring with Windows 11.\n\nCouple of days later (after speaking with a friend - he wanted to buy it from me) I got a MacBook Air M4. What a piece of machinery! Slick, compact, so beautiful and the OS seemed so nice...until I actually started using it.\n\nWTF is Apple doing with its software... is this supposed to be easy to use? Even Linux has far better usability. I installed all kinds of apps to make it behave properly, like actually close the App with X, then make the windows maximize by clicking on the title and lots, lots more. I searched in Homebrew, made all kind of changes, but it felt too unintuitive. The cooperation with AirPods & iPhone is perfect, but the OS itself is a mess.\n\nSpoke with my friend again, he said he wants that too. I told him he can get only 1 and he said I can give him which I don't need. So last night, I set up the Windows Laptop again, after 3 days of weirdness of the macOS, I feel like using an OS that makes sense. Today is the day he gets the MacBook. I wish him luck as he never used a Mac.",

    "selftext": "Every laptop cooler is either insanely loud or barely does anything. But can it be silent and actually lower temperatures at the same time?  \n  \nThink about it: to cool a laptop with a stand, air has to pass through tiny gaps in the chassis. If you don't seal them with foam, the air just escapes and barely goes through, that's massive air resistance to overcome! For that, you'd need a fan with high static pressure, which means high RPM and a lor of noise.\n\nHere's what I did: In a previus \\[post\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1nxymi3/i\\_just\\_installed\\_my\\_dream\\_mod\\_and\\_i\\_love\\_it/), I installed a custom heatsink over the laptop's heatpipes, drawing heat straight out, it already help thermals a lot passively. Now I have a hot plate on the back of the laptop, so I don't need airflow through the case, I just need to cool the plate. I used an ultra-low noise Noctua A12-25 LS-PWM fan pointed directly at it. Result: dissipating about 46 watt between CPU and GPU almost silently.\n\nI even tested with Furmark 2 at full \"stock\" GPU power (80W), with the laptop fans at minimum (2000RPM). I swear, It's so quiet that even slight coil whine sounds louder than the fans. Temperatures stay under 76C.\n\nI'm super proud of the result, I don't think I've ever seen a laptop so quiet while handling such high dissipation.",

Loved how light, quiet, and cool it was when I lugged it around campus or traveled weekly, but I don't do either of those anymore and, even though I still use it every day, it needs a couple replacement parts (battery + keyboard = $100-125-ish) to be its best self and it's not Win11 compatible, so it's time to look forward...\n\nBecause I don't need the new laptop to be what this one was, I am setting a much lower budget for myself this time around: **$500**\n\nHome use, mostly browsing from the couch/recliner and/or when I don't want to move 20 feet to use the desktop. No actual gaming. May watch a movie on it once a year if/when I travel. 10-key not needed for any sort of data entry. Thinking 14\"-15\" but open to 13\"-16\" if better for current/projected use case. Again, loved the X1C being 2.5 lbs (big difference from the 17\" 6-lb behemoth I had before it), but somewhere in between is fine. Love the X1C's keyboard. Cannot stand mushy keys.\n\nWould like to be able to upgrade RAM (my X1C's is soldered to the mobo). Would like it to be Win11 compatible. I'm in the US.\n\nOpen to everything from a refurb X1C Gen9 for \\~$400 to a new \"lower\" model or different brand entirely.\n\nThoughts? Recos? Brands/models to definitely stay away from? Thanks in advance.",

If indifferent, put N/A.\\\nBetween 14 and 16 inches is fine.\n\nAre you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\\\nYes ‚Äî light photo/video editing (Photoshop, Premiere basics) and gaming in free time.\n\nIf you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\\\nModern AAA games at 1080p, mix of high/mid (sometimes low) settings, around 60‚Äì70 FPS.\n\nAny specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\\\nGood keyboard, decent color accuracy (sRGB) for studying/editing, reliable thermals, and MUX switch / Adv Optimus if possible.\n\nLeave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\\\nI really liked the Lenovo LOQ lineup at first, but I‚Äôve read about motherboard issues on some 2024 units, which worries me since I won‚Äôt have warranty coverage.\nI‚Äôm mainly considering **RTX 4050 / 4060** laptops. The **RTX 30-series** is quite old and hard to find both in the UAE and Iran, and **RTX 5050** is just being introduced ‚Äî close to my budget, though discounts on it are likely to be limited for now.\\\nSince I‚Äôll often use it on battery for light work, I‚Äôd prefer a CPU with a strong enough iGPU (so not something like **Ryzen 7 7435HS** that doesn't have any iGPU).\\\nMy goal is to find a reliable, well-balanced laptop that will last 3‚Äì4 years and handle both gaming and student work smoothly.\n\n\nFor context ‚Äî I‚Äôm a nursing student, and the average monthly income** for a newly graduated nurse working in a hospital here is about **20 million Toman** (Iran currency) (~680 AED , ~180 USD).\nThat means my 100M Toman budget equals roughly **5 months** of a nurse‚Äôs early-career salary, so I really can‚Äôt stretch it any further.\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions or reliability feedback! üôè",

    "selftext": "I travel for work a lot and want to game when I'm on the road but gaming laptops seem like you're always compromising. Desktop replacements with RTX 4070 or higher are like 2000+ and weigh 7 pounds which defeats the purpose of a laptop. Thinner gaming laptops with RTX 4060 are more portable but then you're not really getting great performance for the money. Battery life on all of them sucks, most reviews say 3-4 hours max doing normal stuff and way less gaming. I mainly play stuff like Elden Ring and whatever new releases come out, want to run things at high settings 1080p minimum. If Black Friday drops a good gaming laptop to like 1400-1600 I'd bite but I'm worried about buying something that's underpowered or will have thermal issues.\n\nHas anyone regretted buying a gaming laptop instead of just getting a desktop and using a regular laptop for travel? And do gaming laptops have real Black Friday deals or just the same prices with inflated MSRPs to make discounts look bigger?",

All this time I had a work laptop that is locked to the bone and my main device is an iPhone 13PM, and I did it all there, movies, YouTube, etc.\n\nSo I got an Asus Zenbook 14\" Ryzen AI 7 350 / 32GB RAM/ OLED Screen, set it up, installed VS Code/VS Studio and some other apps. Was kinda boring with Windows 11.\n\nCouple of days later (after speaking with a friend - he wanted to buy it from me) I got a MacBook Air M4. What a piece of machinery! Slick, compact, so beautiful and the OS seemed so nice...until I actually started using it.\n\nWTF is Apple doing with its software... is this supposed to be easy to use? Even Linux has far better usability. I installed all kinds of apps to make it behave properly, like actually close the App with X, then make the windows maximize by clicking on the title and lots, lots more. I searched in Homebrew, made all kind of changes, but it felt too unintuitive. The cooperation with AirPods & iPhone is perfect, but the OS itself is a mess.\n\nSpoke with my friend again, he said he wants that too. I told him he can get only 1 and he said I can give him which I don't need. So last night, I set up the Windows Laptop again, after 3 days of weirdness of the macOS, I feel like using an OS that makes sense. Today is the day he gets the MacBook. I wish him luck as he never used a Mac.",

    "selftext": "Every laptop cooler is either insanely loud or barely does anything. But can it be silent and actually lower temperatures at the same time?  \n  \nThink about it: to cool a laptop with a stand, air has to pass through tiny gaps in the chassis. If you don't seal them with foam, the air just escapes and barely goes through, that's massive air resistance to overcome! For that, you'd need a fan with high static pressure, which means high RPM and a lor of noise.\n\nHere's what I did: In a previus \\[post\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1nxymi3/i\\_just\\_installed\\_my\\_dream\\_mod\\_and\\_i\\_love\\_it/), I installed a custom heatsink over the laptop's heatpipes, drawing heat straight out, it already help thermals a lot passively. Now I have a hot plate on the back of the laptop, so I don't need airflow through the case, I just need to cool the plate. I used an ultra-low noise Noctua A12-25 LS-PWM fan pointed directly at it. Result: dissipating about 46 watt between CPU and GPU almost silently.\n\nI even tested with Furmark 2 at full \"stock\" GPU power (80W), with the laptop fans at minimum (2000RPM). I swear, It's so quiet that even slight coil whine sounds louder than the fans. Temperatures stay under 76C.\n\nI'm super proud of the result, I don't think I've ever seen a laptop so quiet while handling such high dissipation.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôve been having a recurring issue with my RTX 2070 Super and I‚Äôm trying to figure out whether the problem is with the GPU itself, the motherboard, or the PSU. I‚Äôll explain everything I‚Äôve done and observed so far. \n\nComputer specs:\n\n* Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix Z390-E Gaming\n* GPU: RTX 2070 Super \n* PSU: 650W ROG Strix 650\n* OS: Windows 10 64-bit\n* CPU**:** Intel Core i7-9700K @ 3.60GHz\n* RAM: 2x Gigabyte DDR4-3200 (PC4-25600) running at 2600 Hz (2X8GB)\n\nI've had this setup for four years with no issues whatsoever. This started happening a couple of weeks ago.\n\nWhenever I use my computer, everything seems perfectly fine at first. I can boot into Windows, browse, watch videos, etc., and it can run fine for minutes and up to a few hours.  \nThen, suddenly, the screen goes black, the GPU fans immediately ramp up to 100%, and the PC remains on but completely unresponsive.  \nThe GPU fans ramp up to 100%, but there‚Äôs no video output and the only way to turn it off is by holding the power button until it shuts down.\n\nIf I open any game, it loads normally up to the main menu, but as soon as I enter the actual game world, the exact same thing happens. Black screen, fans max out, and the system freezes.\n\nWhen this started happening, it was with Fallout 76. I could open the game and run it for maybe around 45 minutes, then the issue would happen.   \nThen it started happening with other games as well, such as Enshrouded, Teddy's Haven, etc.  \nAnd it started happening just a few minutes after opening the game. Then as soon as I enter the the game world. \n\nOne thing I haven't seen in forums online is that  \n**Right when the screen goes black and the fans ramp up to 100%, there's also a noise which comes from the GPU. It's this sort of metallic pipe-like clicking sound. It's just one \"click\" and then the issue happens.** \n\nAlso, whenever I tried to go into safe mode with the GPU connected the same issue happened everytime I tried to within minutes. \n\n  \nWhat I‚Äôve tried so far:\n\n* Removed and reinstalled the GPU.\n* Used a brand-new PCIe power cable (and made sure that every single cable was connected properly)\n* Switched from one single cable to two separate cables for the GPU. (My 2070 has a 6 pin and an 8 pin connector for the PCie cables).\n* Tried different PSU ports, and even used two different ports at once. (I've read its recommended to use one PCIe cable for each port on the GPU and PSU).\n* Ran the PC without the GPU for several days, using only the integrated graphics. It stayed perfectly stable for hours with no issues at all.\n* Used DDU to completely uninstall NVIDIA drivers, then reinstalled a known stable driver version. After doing that, I noticed game textures started taking much longer to load, and eventually the same crash happened again.\n* Ran AIDA64 stress tests (without the GPU) for over an hour with no crashes, CPU temperature peaked at 81¬∞C, everything remained stable.\n\nWhat I havent tried that I can think of:\n\n* Using AIDA64 to stress test the GPU.\n* Testing this GPU in another PC.\n* Testing another GPU in my system.\n\nHas anyone experienced the exact same symptoms? Sudden black screen, fans maxing out, system still on? And found a fix that didn‚Äôt involve replacing the card?  \nAny advice on further tests or BIOS tweaks I could try before giving up on this GPU would be greatly appreciated as well.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I recently came across a ridiculously cheap ($15) ITX Skylake system, and decided I'd use it to throw together a cheap, secondary rig to hook up to my living room TV for some couch gaming. I know that Skylake is old and that it won't perform well in modern games, and I also know that there are Windows 11 compatibility issues (I'll use Rufus to create an installer or just run a Linux distro) - I've got a modern system that can handle those kinds of gaming needs, this machine will be used for emulation, indie games, Steam in-home streaming, and experiences that are just generally better suited to a couch and controller than a mouse and keyboard. \n\nI currently have a lot of spare parts to put together a functional machine, the one thing I'm lacking, though, is a graphics card. Between budgetary considerations and trying to build a balanced system, I'm aiming for a lower end, possibly used graphics card. As such, I'm hoping I could get some suggestions as to what card would make sense to pair with a platform that old. Currently I'm considering the following: \n\n1. A modern 50-class card from Nvidia - preferably a used 3050\n2. An Intel Arc card, likely an A310 or A380. They can be found brand new on Amazon for $100 and $140, respectively. I've been leaning a bit in this direction because I want to play around with an Arc card, and I know that the upscaling even on the Alchemist cards was supposed to be pretty decent - it seems like the best way to squeeze as much as I can out of this machine. These are also available in low profile and single fan variants, which will help when it comes to building in my old Silverstone SG05. \n3. A used GTX 1060 or GTX 1650 available locally. I know they're old and won't perform well with anything remotely modern, but I can find multiple examples of both cards for under $50\n4. A used AMD card from eBay - likely an RX 5600/XT, or an RX 6500. Whatever I can get under $100. \n\nAs I said, I'm kind of leaning toward Arc, but would appreciate advice or other suggestions. I know that Arc was a little rough at first and that Alchemist was very much a first generation product that had a lot of issues that were resolved with Battlemage. That being said, this isn't going to be my primary machine and I'm perfectly comfortable tinkering or dealing with some hiccups here and there if its able to provide an overall decent experience. That being said, I'd also like to hear any other recommendations. If you were trying to throw together a cheap Skylake machine, what graphics card would you pair with it? ",

    "selftext": "Good afternoon all,\n\nI am in the process of planning out my pc build and still and always in the process of doing more research. As stated, my intentions of using the pc revolve around gaming, streaming and possible content creation. I am a dad, so it won‚Äôt be a full time thing, nor am I professional at either or those categories stated above, but I do want a system that‚Äôs able to perform at a mid-high level for each category listed. Also, I‚Äôm looking to achieve PvP and some PvE gameplay at 1440p and with enough frames to keep me at competition level. I‚Äôve changed up my mock build a lot based on recommendations and further research and have finally set on the Ryzen 7 9700x as my focal point. Now for the important part:\n\nMy intended budget was 15-1700. My more realistic budget is 2-2200. I tried to set up the blueprint to make it easier if I want to upgrade in the future. With my basic needs, ( cpu, gpu, mother board, memory, storage, pcu, and cpu cooler ) I come to about 1650. I upped the budgets, for other necessities and things I may be leaving out. I will place the specs below for what I have picked out, and I‚Äôm just looking for opinions on my choices and if there are any advised alternatives that won‚Äôt necessarily break my budget in half. \n\nSpecs are as follows: \n\nCPU: Ryzen 7 9700x \n\nMB: ASUS Tuf Gaming B850 plus WiFi 7(AM5) \n\nCooler: Montech Hyperflow ARGB 360 ( personal aesthetic and overall performance pick )\n\nGPU**: XFX Swift AMD Raedeon RX 9070 Triple Fan \n\nMemory: Patriot Viper Venom 32gb DDR, 6000 CL30\n\nStorage: Samsung 990 pro 2 TB PCle 4.0 x 4\n\nPCU: Corsair RM750E\n\nOS: Windows 11\n\nI‚Äôm aware at the price I‚Äôm at, I may be able to upgrade my gpu a bit, however, the price for the above listed (approx 1650) doesn‚Äôt include things such as a monitor, webcam for streaming, mouse, pc case and anything else I‚Äôm missing. If I left anything crucial out please let me know. I hope this is the baseline for what I‚Äôm to work with and can make minor changes from here on out. My brain is fried. \n\n*Random but crucial, does anyone know if I need a specific case to accommodate this specific build? \n\nThank you in advance for any help. ",

    "selftext": "Super weird problem. I've had my rig for 6 years now and left it unchanged other than adding a stick of RAM a few years ago. I put my desktop to sleep and then when I tried to start it up later, I heard the GPU (EVGA RTX 2080Ti) fans going high speed and there was no display. No problem, this has happened before. I power everything off including the PSU (Seasonic 750w Plat rating) and unplug the cord out of the back of the PSU. Then I take out and reseat my GPU. Replug and power on, same thing. To describe more, the graphics card is lit up when it's booting BIOS and stuff, I think once it tries loading Windows is when the problems start. GPU light turns off and the fans spin at max speed. It's definitely posting because I hear the Windows 11 tune go off on my speakers, there's just no display. Try resetting the BIOS via the jumper on the MOBA (GIGABYTE X570 AORUS ELITE), take out and put back in the CMOS battery, still nothing. Tried a different PCIe slot, nothing. Tried everything again and again, no dice. I went out and bought a cheap graphics card (MSI RTX 3050) and after resetting BIOS my computer now displays, albeit at a much lower efficiency. I guess that means it's not a MOBA problem? The cheap graphics card doesn't require an the extra cable to the PSU, it just goes off the power of the MOBA, so maybe it could be the cable? Could the problem be the PSU? Could it just be that the interior is dirty? I think the very basic answer is the graphics card died, but I don't want to buy a new graphics card because, well it ain't cheap, and if I don't have to buy a new card then I won't. Anyone have any ideas?",

Yes I would be gaming, but gaming is not my main concern, I will use this for my job also(developer, so lots of docker images running in the background and I don't want any crying from my hardware as I had before, even from MAC in my previous job) and my hobby(3D blender work which includes some rendering). For these I would also like to include RTX 5080, which I actually already bought(Gigabyte Windforce OC SFF). What I'm confused with even now are slots. I'd like to use SAMSUNG 2TB 9100 Pro M.2 2280 MZ-VAP2T0BW SSD along with my graphics card, and also DDR5 6000Mhz Kingston FURY Beast 2x 32GB RAM. First, as far as I can see, my SSD is PCIe 5.0 and so is my Graphics card, I just don't know what does this mean: \"PCI\\_E1 Gen PCIe 5.0 supports up to x16 (From CPU)\" which is written in SLOT section on [msi.com](http://msi.com) for mentioned motherboards, and if I can fit both my GPU and SSD in here. Also  Would you guys recommend anything better for my needs in terms of RAM, SSD, or processor? I don't want to pay premium prices for some RGB aesthetics, but I'd like to work on this pc and sometimes enjoy some gaming for at least 5 next years flawlessly. BTW, do any of you have experience with multiple screen setups, and should it actually be possible to connect two screens on my GPU in the setup?",

He only really plays on his 4K OLED TV.\n\nNow he thinks the 12GB VRAM of the 5070 is not enough (I actually advised him to get a GPU with 16GB, but he didn't listen to me) and sold it before he even decided which GPU to buy instead.\n\nHe is now considering what to get. He has the choice between a 9070 XT for around ~600‚Ç¨ or a 5080 for around ~1050‚Ç¨.\n\nI know that for 4K you need as much power as possible, which speaks in favour of the 5080. But the 5080 also \"only\" has 16GB VRAM. I think he would also be fine with a 9070 XT (or maybe a 5070 Ti) if he uses upscaling/framegen/...\n\nI would have recommended that he get the 9070XT and save the money for future GPU upgrades.\n\nFor your information: he plays on a 4K LG OLED TV (i.e. max. 120FPS) and is currently playing games such as Battlefield 6.\n\nWhat do you think, is the extra cost of ~450‚Ç¨ for the 5080 worth it?

    "title": "Upgrading from a 5600G to a 5700X, worth it?",
    "selftext": "Good day everyone,   \n  \nQuick recap of my story: I have a Ryzen 5600G (I didn't have a dedicated GPU for some time) and now I have bought an RX 9070XT. I play in 1440p and have noticed a significant CPU bottleneck in BF6 & CP2077, squeezing a 4,5Ghz all-core boost in games via PBO2+CO helped mitigate it in BF6 but in CP2077 it is still present.\n\nReturning to my title question, will an upgrade to a 5700X help a lot or even fully mitigate that bottleneck? I am looking around for an used 5700X3D but sadly the availability in my country is close to zero.\n\nI will be very grateful for any advice.\n\nEdit: Also, would a manual OC of my 5600G help? I've heard mixed opinions about manually OCing Ryzens.\n\nEdit: Based on your input, I have bought the 5700X. Thank you all :-)",

I‚Äôve been thinking about a way to build more frequently and was hoping to get some feedback. My idea is to build PCs and sell them at cost. No markup, no profit, charging just enough to cover parts and maybe shipping if needed, but I'm hoping to sell them locally. I really enjoy the build process, and unpackaging and working with the latest parts is reward enough. This would let me practice more often, try new configurations, and stay more engaged with the hobby as well.\n\nBefore I dive in, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Has anyone here tried something similar? \n* Are there hidden challenges I should be aware of like needing warranties or support expectations?\n* Any tips on how to structure this so it‚Äôs sustainable and transparent?\n\nMy initial idea entailed providing the buyer with all receipts and original packaging, so that if there were any issues with a component, they could use any existing manufacturers' warranties. \n\n I‚Äôm not looking to compete with anyone or make money. I just want to build more often and share the results with people who might benefit. I appreciate any insights or experiences you‚Äôre willing to share!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm finally pulling the trigger on a GPU upgrade and I've narrowed it down to the 9070 or the 9070 XT. I've done a bit of research, watching  benchmark videos on YouTube, but I'm stuck and would love some input from people who might have made this choice themselves.\n\nHere's the breakdown from what I've gathered:\n\n*   **Price Difference:** The XT is **$155 CAD** more. Not a trivial amount, but not bank-breaking either.\n*   **Performance:** At 1440p, it looks like a **10-13 FPS** gain. At 4K, it's a bit smaller, around a **5-8 FPS** difference. It's a consistent bump, but the gap isn't huge.\n*   **Power Draw:** This is a big one for me. The XT pulls about **100W more**.\n\nMy situation:\n*   My case is a smaller form factor, but it can technically handle the thermals of either card.\n*   I'm **really partial to noise levels**. A quieter system is a high priority for me.\n*   Given the smaller performance gap and the higher power draw, I'm heavily leaning towards the standard **9070** for its better power efficiency and the $155 savings.\n\nMy gut feeling is that I wouldn't be missing out on a *minor* amount of performance for the difference. The trade-off for a cooler, quieter, and more efficient card seems worth it.\n\nThe thing is, a lot of the posts and discussions I see about this are from over a year ago around launch. I'm curious if anyone has lived with either card (or made this exact choice) since then and what your long-term thoughts are.\n\nHas anyone who chose the 9070 over the XT regretted it? Or has anyone with the XT found that the extra power and noise wasn't worth the frames?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI have always loved building my own PCs, but it's not something I'm really able to do very often (without getting into hot water with my wife). I‚Äôve been thinking about a way to build more frequently and was hoping to get some feedback. My idea is to build PCs and sell them at cost. No markup, no profit, charging just enough to cover parts and maybe shipping if needed, but I'm hoping to sell them locally. I really enjoy the build process, and unpackaging and working with the latest parts is reward enough. This would let me practice more often, try new configurations, and stay more engaged with the hobby as well.\n\nBefore I dive in, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Has anyone here tried something similar? \n* Are there hidden challenges I should be aware of like needing warranties or support expectations?\n* Any tips on how to structure this so it‚Äôs sustainable and transparent?\n\nMy initial idea entailed providing the buyer with all receipts and original packaging, so that if there were any issues with a component, they could use any existing manufacturers' warranties. \n\n I‚Äôm not looking to compete with anyone or make money. I just want to build more often and share the results with people who might benefit. I appreciate any insights or experiences you‚Äôre willing to share!",

He only really plays on his 4K OLED TV.\n\nNow he thinks the 12GB VRAM of the 5070 is not enough (I actually advised him to get a GPU with 16GB, but he didn't listen to me) and sold it before he even decided which GPU to buy instead.\n\nHe is now considering what to get. He has the choice between a 9070 XT for around ~600‚Ç¨ or a 5080 for around ~1050‚Ç¨.\n\nI know that for 4K you need as much power as possible, which speaks in favour of the 5080. But the 5080 also \"only\" has 16GB VRAM. I think he would also be fine with a 9070 XT (or maybe a 5070 Ti) if he uses upscaling/framegen/...\n\nI would have recommended that he get the 9070XT and save the money for future GPU upgrades.\n\nFor your information: he plays on a 4K LG OLED TV (i.e. max. 120FPS) and is currently playing games such as Battlefield 6.\n\nWhat do you think, is the extra cost of ~450‚Ç¨ for the 5080 worth it?

I also live in Florida where it's hot 95% of the time.\n\nAm I missing something obvious? How did adding¬†*more*¬†exhaust make my temps worse? Is the stock cooler just not enough for this CPU/GPU combo in this case?\n\nThanks in all advance for the help!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôve been having a recurring issue with my RTX 2070 Super and I‚Äôm trying to figure out whether the problem is with the GPU itself, the motherboard, or the PSU. I‚Äôll explain everything I‚Äôve done and observed so far. \n\nComputer specs:\n\n* Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix Z390-E Gaming\n* GPU: RTX 2070 Super \n* PSU: 650W ROG Strix 650\n* OS: Windows 10 64-bit\n* CPU**:** Intel Core i7-9700K @ 3.60GHz\n* RAM: 2x Gigabyte DDR4-3200 (PC4-25600) running at 2600 Hz (2X8GB)\n\nI've had this setup for four years with no issues whatsoever. This started happening a couple of weeks ago.\n\nWhenever I use my computer, everything seems perfectly fine at first. I can boot into Windows, browse, watch videos, etc., and it can run fine for minutes and up to a few hours.  \nThen, suddenly, the screen goes black, the GPU fans immediately ramp up to 100%, and the PC remains on but completely unresponsive.  \nThe GPU fans ramp up to 100%, but there‚Äôs no video output and the only way to turn it off is by holding the power button until it shuts down.\n\nIf I open any game, it loads normally up to the main menu, but as soon as I enter the actual game world, the exact same thing happens. Black screen, fans max out, and the system freezes.\n\nWhen this started happening, it was with Fallout 76. I could open the game and run it for maybe around 45 minutes, then the issue would happen.   \nThen it started happening with other games as well, such as Enshrouded, Teddy's Haven, etc.  \nAnd it started happening just a few minutes after opening the game. Then as soon as I enter the the game world. \n\nOne thing I haven't seen in forums online is that  \n**Right when the screen goes black and the fans ramp up to 100%, there's also a noise which comes from the GPU. It's this sort of metallic pipe-like clicking sound. It's just one \"click\" and then the issue happens.** \n\nAlso, whenever I tried to go into safe mode with the GPU connected the same issue happened everytime I tried to within minutes. \n\n  \nWhat I‚Äôve tried so far:\n\n* Removed and reinstalled the GPU.\n* Used a brand-new PCIe power cable (and made sure that every single cable was connected properly)\n* Switched from one single cable to two separate cables for the GPU. (My 2070 has a 6 pin and an 8 pin connector for the PCie cables).\n* Tried different PSU ports, and even used two different ports at once. (I've read its recommended to use one PCIe cable for each port on the GPU and PSU).\n* Ran the PC without the GPU for several days, using only the integrated graphics. It stayed perfectly stable for hours with no issues at all.\n* Used DDU to completely uninstall NVIDIA drivers, then reinstalled a known stable driver version. After doing that, I noticed game textures started taking much longer to load, and eventually the same crash happened again.\n* Ran AIDA64 stress tests (without the GPU) for over an hour with no crashes, CPU temperature peaked at 81¬∞C, everything remained stable.\n\nWhat I havent tried that I can think of:\n\n* Using AIDA64 to stress test the GPU.\n* Testing this GPU in another PC.\n* Testing another GPU in my system.\n\nHas anyone experienced the exact same symptoms? Sudden black screen, fans maxing out, system still on? And found a fix that didn‚Äôt involve replacing the card?  \nAny advice on further tests or BIOS tweaks I could try before giving up on this GPU would be greatly appreciated as well.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I recently came across a ridiculously cheap ($15) ITX Skylake system, and decided I'd use it to throw together a cheap, secondary rig to hook up to my living room TV for some couch gaming. I know that Skylake is old and that it won't perform well in modern games, and I also know that there are Windows 11 compatibility issues (I'll use Rufus to create an installer or just run a Linux distro) - I've got a modern system that can handle those kinds of gaming needs, this machine will be used for emulation, indie games, Steam in-home streaming, and experiences that are just generally better suited to a couch and controller than a mouse and keyboard. \n\nI currently have a lot of spare parts to put together a functional machine, the one thing I'm lacking, though, is a graphics card. Between budgetary considerations and trying to build a balanced system, I'm aiming for a lower end, possibly used graphics card. As such, I'm hoping I could get some suggestions as to what card would make sense to pair with a platform that old. Currently I'm considering the following: \n\n1. A modern 50-class card from Nvidia - preferably a used 3050\n2. An Intel Arc card, likely an A310 or A380. They can be found brand new on Amazon for $100 and $140, respectively. I've been leaning a bit in this direction because I want to play around with an Arc card, and I know that the upscaling even on the Alchemist cards was supposed to be pretty decent - it seems like the best way to squeeze as much as I can out of this machine. These are also available in low profile and single fan variants, which will help when it comes to building in my old Silverstone SG05. \n3. A used GTX 1060 or GTX 1650 available locally. I know they're old and won't perform well with anything remotely modern, but I can find multiple examples of both cards for under $50\n4. A used AMD card from eBay - likely an RX 5600/XT, or an RX 6500. Whatever I can get under $100. \n\nAs I said, I'm kind of leaning toward Arc, but would appreciate advice or other suggestions. I know that Arc was a little rough at first and that Alchemist was very much a first generation product that had a lot of issues that were resolved with Battlemage. That being said, this isn't going to be my primary machine and I'm perfectly comfortable tinkering or dealing with some hiccups here and there if its able to provide an overall decent experience. That being said, I'd also like to hear any other recommendations. If you were trying to throw together a cheap Skylake machine, what graphics card would you pair with it? ",

    "selftext": "Good afternoon all,\n\nI am in the process of planning out my pc build and still and always in the process of doing more research. As stated, my intentions of using the pc revolve around gaming, streaming and possible content creation. I am a dad, so it won‚Äôt be a full time thing, nor am I professional at either or those categories stated above, but I do want a system that‚Äôs able to perform at a mid-high level for each category listed. Also, I‚Äôm looking to achieve PvP and some PvE gameplay at 1440p and with enough frames to keep me at competition level. I‚Äôve changed up my mock build a lot based on recommendations and further research and have finally set on the Ryzen 7 9700x as my focal point. Now for the important part:\n\nMy intended budget was 15-1700. My more realistic budget is 2-2200. I tried to set up the blueprint to make it easier if I want to upgrade in the future. With my basic needs, ( cpu, gpu, mother board, memory, storage, pcu, and cpu cooler ) I come to about 1650. I upped the budgets, for other necessities and things I may be leaving out. I will place the specs below for what I have picked out, and I‚Äôm just looking for opinions on my choices and if there are any advised alternatives that won‚Äôt necessarily break my budget in half. \n\nSpecs are as follows: \n\nCPU: Ryzen 7 9700x \n\nMB: ASUS Tuf Gaming B850 plus WiFi 7(AM5) \n\nCooler: Montech Hyperflow ARGB 360 ( personal aesthetic and overall performance pick )\n\nGPU**: XFX Swift AMD Raedeon RX 9070 Triple Fan \n\nMemory: Patriot Viper Venom 32gb DDR, 6000 CL30\n\nStorage: Samsung 990 pro 2 TB PCle 4.0 x 4\n\nPCU: Corsair RM750E\n\nOS: Windows 11\n\nI‚Äôm aware at the price I‚Äôm at, I may be able to upgrade my gpu a bit, however, the price for the above listed (approx 1650) doesn‚Äôt include things such as a monitor, webcam for streaming, mouse, pc case and anything else I‚Äôm missing. If I left anything crucial out please let me know. I hope this is the baseline for what I‚Äôm to work with and can make minor changes from here on out. My brain is fried. \n\n*Random but crucial, does anyone know if I need a specific case to accommodate this specific build? \n\nThank you in advance for any help. ",

    "selftext": "Super weird problem. I've had my rig for 6 years now and left it unchanged other than adding a stick of RAM a few years ago. I put my desktop to sleep and then when I tried to start it up later, I heard the GPU (EVGA RTX 2080Ti) fans going high speed and there was no display. No problem, this has happened before. I power everything off including the PSU (Seasonic 750w Plat rating) and unplug the cord out of the back of the PSU. Then I take out and reseat my GPU. Replug and power on, same thing. To describe more, the graphics card is lit up when it's booting BIOS and stuff, I think once it tries loading Windows is when the problems start. GPU light turns off and the fans spin at max speed. It's definitely posting because I hear the Windows 11 tune go off on my speakers, there's just no display. Try resetting the BIOS via the jumper on the MOBA (GIGABYTE X570 AORUS ELITE), take out and put back in the CMOS battery, still nothing. Tried a different PCIe slot, nothing. Tried everything again and again, no dice. I went out and bought a cheap graphics card (MSI RTX 3050) and after resetting BIOS my computer now displays, albeit at a much lower efficiency. I guess that means it's not a MOBA problem? The cheap graphics card doesn't require an the extra cable to the PSU, it just goes off the power of the MOBA, so maybe it could be the cable? Could the problem be the PSU? Could it just be that the interior is dirty? I think the very basic answer is the graphics card died, but I don't want to buy a new graphics card because, well it ain't cheap, and if I don't have to buy a new card then I won't. Anyone have any ideas?",

Last night I was playing on my phone watching ‚Äúbest 2025 PC build‚Äù videos, and every creator has a completely different opinion one says go AMD, the next says Intel, one says air cooling is fine, another says liquid or bust. Now I‚Äôm just stuck second-guessing everything.   \nI‚Äôve got around $1,500 saved up and I mostly play FPS and some light editing, but I want the build to last a few years. Is there a simple way to narrow this stuff down without going insane from comparison overload?\n\nWould love any advice or even just hearing what helped other people finally pull the trigger on their first build.",

PC is booting slower, and is working much slower compared to win 10. I even upgraded to 32 gigs of ddr4 3600 mhz ram and ryzen 5 5600x (i had 16 gb 2666mhz and ryzen 5 3600 before) and that old configuration was working much faster on windows 10 then now with new processor and RAM on windows 11. I dont know what to do. I saw people go to full clean install instead of just updating to win 11 like i did. What do yout think what is the cause of my pc being slower now. I deleted old windows 10 and everything and i dont know at this point what to do. What do you think about going full clean installing windows 11?",

Rather than let it die, I'm making it open source in hopes that someone in the community will pick it up and continue development.\n\n**Looking for Maintainers:**\nI'm specifically looking for someone who wants to seriously take on the project and manage the public repository. If you're interested or want to discuss, join the Fuzion Discord - link to Discord in the repo readme.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/stomane/fuzion\n\nFeel free to fork it, fix it, improve it, or use it as a learning resource.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, hope you‚Äôre all doing good.\n\nSo I saw a post earlier where someone was asking whether to buy *Arc Raiders* on Epic or Steam. They ended up going with Steam, which is fair, but it reminded me how every time this topic comes up people go *‚ÄúSteam‚Äôs better. Epic‚Äôs UI sucks.‚Äù*\n\nAnd I‚Äôm just curious, what *exactly* is it that people dislike so much about Epic‚Äôs UI?\n\nI use both pretty evenly, and honestly, they feel about the same to me. Most of what I do is:\n\n* Buy games\n* Read game pages / watch trailers\n* Launch games\n\nFor those things, both launchers get the job done. Epic even loads faster on my PC, Steam always does its little update check on startup, which takes a bit.\n\nWhen it comes to the library, I actually kinda prefer Epic‚Äôs layout. The quick launch tab and filters (like ‚Äúinstalled only‚Äù or ‚Äúrecently added‚Äù) are super handy. Steam‚Äôs library always feels a bit cluttered unless I manually organize everything.\n\nThat said, Steam definitely wins once you click on a specific game, the playtime, achievements, screenshots, reviews, all that. Epic mostly just shows the title unless you go to the store page.\n\nStill, in day-to-day use, I just click *Play* or *Launch* and that‚Äôs it. Steam has Big Picture Mode and better controller input stuff, sure, but I don‚Äôt really use overlays or custom mappings anyway since my Xbox controller works fine in most games.\n\nSo yeah, for people who *really* dislike Epic‚Äôs launcher:  \n\\-What is it specifically that bothers you?  \n\\-Is it missing features like achievements/workshop/etc.?  \n\\-Or do you just find the design itself clunky or ugly?\n\nNot talking about the ‚ÄúI want all my games in one place‚Äù thing, that‚Äôs fair. I mean purely when people say Epic‚Äôs *UI/UX* is bad. What about it makes it bad to you?\n\n**TL;DR:** I use both Steam and Epic about the same and don‚Äôt see a big difference. What about Epic‚Äôs *UI* makes people dislike it so much?",

Yet, all of them have felt like they are missing something fundamentally \n\nI have the most hours on Hoi4 and I will say with mods the game gets a nice refresh and depth but it‚Äôs still more of a military simulation, I wish the game had a deeper economic and law system \n\nSuperpower 2 has a special place in my heart but it‚Äôs way too simple and the game tends to break after awhile \n\nSuperpower 3 is completely garbage and can‚Äôt even be considered a game since it‚Äôs developers abandoned it after release \n\nRealpolitiks is good and has a nice UI but the gameplay is too simple and boring. The new game is also completely broken and not playable \n\nIt feels like every new game that comes out is so broken and incomplete. I am hopeful that this will give some room and demand for a developer to make something really special that will have little to no competition \n\n",

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community:¬†[https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

    "selftext": "How were games being developed 10-20 years ago in shorter time frames with extreme technological limitations compared to today, and yet those games were perceived much higher quality while the studios were happy with their profit margins?  \n  \nCompared to today, where you would think that with how far we‚Äôve come with technological advancement that games should be much easier to make, cost far less money to create(especially digital copies reducing disk/case production), and should run far better with the amazing hardware we all have. Yet all we hear is company XYZ cutting corners, firing staff, poor optimizations, $90 price tag etc. while somehow these companies are also still not making enough money?  \n  \nFor example, how was Infinity Ward/Activision able to make one of the greatest COD games MW2 in 16 months and run on a PS3 with 256mb ram near flawlessly, but I can‚Äôt even run Warzone smoothly on low settings on my fucking RTX5070 with 32gb RAM, and they‚Äôve been actively developing/patching that garbage for like 5-7 years? Not to mention the fact they‚Äôve milked revenue from that game the whole time through skins while MW2 was being patched for free.     \n  \n  \nIt sounds stupid, but did these companies forget about saving money by hiring talented people who can manage projects and create quality products within reasonable constraints, who understand limitations and can be creative to work around them? Why are studios hiring people who create garbage then spend a year(s) post production patching the game to make it playable? In the construction industry there‚Äôs a saying we use along the lines of, ‚ÄúIf you have time to come back and fix it, you had time to do it right the first time.‚Äù. \n  \nBit of a rant but also a general curiosity on how this industry has completely evolved to something that doesn‚Äôt seem to understand what they‚Äôve got their hands on. This seems like the best time to make unbelievable money and create amazing quality games and it just isn‚Äôt happening for some of these big names.\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n",

Your micro, macro, game sense, hero selection, strategy, mindset, etc.\n\nYou can't control what kinds of teammates you get queued up with, how they play, or the reliability of your internet/system.

No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a long road, but this one‚Äôs been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "Hi r/PCGaming!\n\nI'm Vince, solo developer of Decimation. Its a sci-fi tower defense game where your towers provide covering fire, but they can't win without you actively fighting with your hero.  \n  \n**What makes it different:**   \nMost tower defense games: Place towers optimally, watch them win. Maybe a hero helps occasionally. In Decimation, if you're not actively using your hero to fight, you lose.   \n  \n**Your hero has:**\n\n* 4 active skills requiring timing and positioning \n* Target-lock system (you choose priority targets, towers can't) \n* Resource collection mid-combat for ultimate ability \n* Meaningful skill expression - button mashing ‚â† skillful play\n\nYou can survive by coasting on easier difficulties, but zero-damage perfect runs require execution.  \nThink: TD macro (placement, resources, tower upgrades) + action micro (hero combat with cooldown management, positioning, battle effect usage).\n\n**About the demo:**\n\n* 4 campaign levels (Act 1 complete) \n* 1 boss encounter\n\n*Note: Levels 1-2 teach mechanics.* ***Levels 3-4 + boss are where skill expression really matters.***\n\n**Free to download and play**  \nüéÆ Demo Download: [https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation](https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation)  \n  \nThis is a solo passion project. 17 months of development so far. Early Access planned for late 2025 with 3 additional acts for the final game. I'll be around to answer questions about the game, the development process, or anything else.   \n  \nThanks all and sincerely hope to hear from you. Would genuinely love feedback on whether the skill-based approach resonates with TD players.",

    "title": "RV there yet? Impressions - Amazing concept but barely works",
    "selftext": "I picked it up yesterday to play with my friends for the first time. I was surprised (in a positive way) at how mechanicaly complex it can be, especially the organizing and reparing the RV part of the game. It seems like the type of game that it's both fun and exciting to master in the long run, BUT I was astonished at how bad it overall works. To the point of taking you out of the immersion multiple times.\n\n\\- This is a physics-based game in which the physics barely work. The rope, the constantly clipping in and out of the RV, the weird collision issues... it's everywhere.\n\n\\- This is a pity, but there's barely a sense of danger or stakes whatosever. From time to time an animal will attack, or there will be a terrain obstacle to overcome, but that's pretty much it. In a way it's cool, this can be a calmer game that, let's say, Peak or REPO. But it also means that in the moment to moment gameplay it can sometimes be somewhat boring, especially because--\n\n\\- This is one of my biggest complaints right now. The multiplayer of this game i feel is not balanced. There were four of us in the RV, and for most of the time, it feels like the game would have worked better with just two. It didn't seem to me like there was much to be done. The person driving has such and advantage mechanically, and there can also be a person looking at the map, but other than that, this is not a Sea of Theves type of thing were EVERY person is needed to manouver the boat. The other two of us were just in the back, seated because you can NOT be walking around the RV while someone's driving because the physics turn crazy. That means it's not a time that you can spend maybe organising the cabinets, playing cards (this is not a mechanic but it would be cool) or something like that.\n\nI want to end on a positive note. Like I said, I really love the premise of the game. It's so unique and full of potential (the chain-smoking is hilarious). If it was well polished and with expanded mechanics, this could be like a land version of Sea of Thieves. But right now is everything but polished. It's so bizarre to me that this is a 1.0 release and not an early access.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe‚Äôve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It‚Äôs a fast, chaotic beat ‚Äôem up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who‚Äôs Mexican, and it‚Äôs directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt‚Äôs basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It‚Äôs been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo‚Äôs now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We‚Äôve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that‚Äôs part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I‚Äôll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pok√©mon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm excited to announce that **Fuzion Game Dock** is now fully open source! üéâ\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Fuzion is a seamless game dock for Windows with automatic icon fetching, styling, and quite a few extra features including:\n\n- üéÆ Deal fetching from Reddit\n- üîç Omni search (searches both Steam and your local dock)\n- üöÄ Delayed and silent game launcher launching when available\n- üéØ Full gamepad support\n- And other things I forgot about\n\n**Demo Videos:**\n- [Feature Overview 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J_RkttY18Y)\n- [Feature Overview 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SxQwtXNbsM)\n- [Feature Overview 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWxGA0x2igY)\n- [Feature Overview 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1nqhvt9KJk)\n- [Feature Overview 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta0jqpnwblw)\n- [Feature Overview 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puYv7PPIAOk)\n\n**Current Status:**\nFuzion was published to the Windows Store ([UWP](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9MTL580GPQ00) | [Standalone](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP8C9QP4X6CN53)), but it's currently not displaying the dock properly in newer versions of Windows 10/11, likely due to changes in desktop rendering.\n\n**Why Open Source?**\nUnfortunately, I no longer have the time to maintain this project. Rather than let it die, I'm making it open source in hopes that someone in the community will pick it up and continue development.\n\n**Looking for Maintainers:**\nI'm specifically looking for someone who wants to seriously take on the project and manage the public repository. If you're interested or want to discuss, join the Fuzion Discord - link to Discord in the repo readme.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/stomane/fuzion\n\nFeel free to fork it, fix it, improve it, or use it as a learning resource. The code is all yours now!\n\nThanks to everyone who used Fuzion over the years. Here's hoping it gets a second life in the hands of the community! üôè",

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community:¬†[https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

    "selftext": "*Amazon.com Inc. is gutting its video-game division as part of a sweeping layoff that will eliminate more than 14,000 corporate jobs.*\n\n*The company didn‚Äôt say how many roles it will cut in the video-game unit, but noted in a memo to staff on Tuesday that the cuts would largely fall on its offices in Irvine and San Diego, as well at its central publishing division. The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs.*\n\n*‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work ‚Äì specifically around MMOs ‚Äì within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,‚Äù wrote Steve Boom, vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Games, in an email to staff reviewed by Bloomberg News.*",

    "selftext": "Seven years ago I had this idea for an underwater PvP survival game. No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a long road, but this one‚Äôs been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm excited to announce that **Fuzion Game Dock** is now fully open source! üéâ\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Fuzion is a seamless game dock for Windows with automatic icon fetching, styling, and quite a few extra features including:\n\n- üéÆ Deal fetching from Reddit\n- üîç Omni search (searches both Steam and your local dock)\n- üöÄ Delayed and silent game launcher launching when available\n- üéØ Full gamepad support\n- And other things I forgot about\n\n**Demo Videos:**\n- [Feature Overview 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J_RkttY18Y)\n- [Feature Overview 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SxQwtXNbsM)\n- [Feature Overview 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWxGA0x2igY)\n- [Feature Overview 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1nqhvt9KJk)\n- [Feature Overview 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta0jqpnwblw)\n- [Feature Overview 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puYv7PPIAOk)\n\n**Current Status:**\nFuzion was published to the Windows Store ([UWP](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9MTL580GPQ00) | [Standalone](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP8C9QP4X6CN53)), but it's currently not displaying the dock properly in newer versions of Windows 10/11, likely due to changes in desktop rendering.\n\n**Why Open Source?**\nUnfortunately, I no longer have the time to maintain this project. Rather than let it die, I'm making it open source in hopes that someone in the community will pick it up and continue development.\n\n**Looking for Maintainers:**\nI'm specifically looking for someone who wants to seriously take on the project and manage the public repository. If you're interested or want to discuss, join the Fuzion Discord - link to Discord in the repo readme.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/stomane/fuzion\n\nFeel free to fork it, fix it, improve it, or use it as a learning resource. The code is all yours now!\n\nThanks to everyone who used Fuzion over the years. Here's hoping it gets a second life in the hands of the community! üôè",

Tried pushing in the HDMI into both ends, pulled it out and plugged again.. nothing.\n\nDP 1.4 works fine, it's just the HDMI (I tried both ports on the screen, neither worked) that doesn't get a signal.\n\nI'm confused.. how could it work yesterday and with literally no changes done over the day not work now? I would prefer HDMI 2.1 for the higher bandwidth (correct me if I am wrong, I don't think DP 1.4 is enough for:  OLED, 3440x1440, 175 Hz, HDR on, 10 bit).\n\nEven if it's enough, it's bugging me.. I don't understand what changed over night. Again, I changed nothing.. no new drivers, no Windows update.. nothing. Could it be the cable itself (though it would be weird, I am using the one that came with the monitor so it's brand new)? I unfortunately don't have a second one laying around right now to check it now.",

Why did they even include Path RT in this game? It feels like it was made with technology from 10 years ago. It would have made much more sense to use static lighting and add SSR instead. Alternatively, they could have used a lighter RT technology instead of Path RT. If you watch the video, you'll see the trickery used to sell the Multiframe technology. This is purely a marketing tactic, and I believe players should react to this. Moreover, I noticed a lot of ghosting and flickering in the video. There should be an oversight body for games, like PEGI. What are your thoughts on this issue?",

    "selftext": "Hello, r/pcmasterrace. I come to you needing recommendations to overcome a very specific annoyance I have, namely: this horrible, rough texture that seems to be present on way too many controllers I've looked into. I understand for most people this texture may be an upside and that's why it's so popular, but it's horribly incompatible with my particular brand of neurodivergence‚Ñ¢ and makes me feel like I'm being stabbed in my palms by thousands of tiny needles. I purchased a regular Xbox Series X/S controller a while ago that had this on the back, not visible on the box, and I hate using it. Most controllers these days are packaged in a way that I can't tell this is present without purchasing and opening it up, which has made me pretty wary.\n\ntl;dr:\n\n1. Need a controller that doesn't have this horrible texture anywhere on it.  Smooth plastic like the old 360 controllers is my ideal.\n\n2. Bluetooth is a must. I have an input swap between my tv and pc for when I want to change formats and wired controllers aren't feasible.\n\n3. Clicky bumpers, not springy. I play some games that require rapid double tapping bumpers and very springy bumpers (for example, the base ps4 controllers from back in the day) make it difficult to complete this input correctly.\n\nThanks for your help!",

    "selftext": "So, I've done quite a lot of research, still doing so, but some things are overwhelming my mind and making it hard to decide. First time building a PC, my budget will be 2000‚Ç¨, and I made the decision of using the following parts so far:\n\n-Ryzen 7 7800X3D\n-RX 9070 XT\n-FOIFKIN M2 Case\n\nIt's not 100% fix decisions, because, well, I'd love some second opinions since these were recommendations from a fella who built PCs longer than me. I was wondering if I should spend some extra cash and go for Nvidia or not? Should I go straight for 1000W PSU or is that overkill? My main goal is mainly gaming at 1080p, and a pc that will last me at least a decade if not more. I already have a gaming laptop, which is already showing signs of failing after 1 year (judge me if you must, I know it was a terrible investment now). Should I use AIO or stick to Air Cooling? I've seen both and both seem cool, I kinda lean towards AIO cuz it looks rather nice, but I'd rather use something that is silent and cools my CPU and GPU just fine. My aim for Gaming is High graphics, not Ultra, at 144 FPS or higher. Peripherals are not necessary at the moment, I have those three sorted already. Any advice or tips are very welcome. I thank every single person for their time and advices in advance! Cheers.",

I‚Äôm going to ask them when I get to the store if they price match Microcenter and see what they say. I feel like there‚Äôs some weird reason why in-store employees will do whatever they can to deny it. Maybe management thinks it looks bad, idk.\n\nThe empty threat to refund the purchase and go to Microcenter instead is definitely the strat.\n\nThe best part is that the CPU was on sale at Microcenter so it can be marked down/on sale which I never would‚Äôve guessed. Clearance items are disqualified though.\n\nWhy not just go to Microcenter you ask? The closest store to me is over an hour away and I have two Best Buy‚Äôs both 5 minutes away.

    "selftext": "I wanted to share a recent story of mine. Basically i've had a very hard time installing my GPU in the case/motherboard but i never understood why. I thought i was just stupid, or that there was a issue with my Lian li o11d evo, i was more inclined towards the first). \n\nSome days ago i had to add a nvme m.2 SSD to install Linux, to get a dual boot system, and because of that, i had to remove the graphics card I've had a such hard time fitting. \n\nAfter some time questioning my life decisions and researching informations/videos, i've understood that something on my left was preventing me from seatting in the GPU, that's when i noticed a very small gap on the left on the motherboard. Then i tired to alight my GPU not only with the motherboard x16 socket, but also the rear panel with the gaps. It just slid so easily into place that I've tasted ecstasy. I've grown a little in a better version of myself. \n\nI was kinda shocked that nobody ever mentioned this, also considering that I've been in this community for years. I don't know if this issue is common or only present in the LIan li o11d lineup. I've seen a few of posts of people encountering this problem without ever resolving it, and ending up sending back the case concluding its faulty. Because of all this, i decided to make a contribute to the community and share this story, setting a precedent that could be found online, in hope of giving a hand to future new builders.\n\nTDLR: while you align the GPU with the motherboard socket, you have to align the rear panel of the GPU with the gaps in the case (see photo), I've found useful giving a gentle push to the rear panel from outside (that would be from left to right using the first photo as reference) to make it fit into the gaps. The graphics card should just slide in with a very gentle push, if you have to use quite a bit of force, you probably are making the same mistake i used to do.",

I usually average around 100-120 fps on high graphics settings (I have fps capped to 120 in-game) but can run 135+ fps on ultra settings. FSR 2.0 & VSync turned off. I have been using the same high graphics settings since I built my pc/started playing the game nearly 2 months ago. It froze so much during my playtime that the game actually crashed (notification popped up on my screen saying ‚ÄúGPU crashed‚Äù and I sent the report to AMD). I did have the newest version of AMD Adrenalin (10.2 I believe) but downgraded to 9.2 because I thought that might have been the problem ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt fix it. \n\nBattlefield 6 averages around 85-100 fps on high graphics settings but doesn‚Äôt freeze, stutter, or (drastically) drop frames. \n\nMy GPU utilization, for both games, is around 85-100% but with only 7-8GB being used out of the 16GB available. CPU utilization is somewhere around 20-35% for both games. \n\nAll of this is according to my Task Manager. MSI Afterburner has my CPU Utilization maxed out (as in 3000+ MHz and the bar all the way filled) but I haven‚Äôt checked it for my GPU utilization. \n\nUserBenchmark had my GPU at like 59% which is ‚Äúpoor performance‚Äù if I remember correctly. \n\nI realize this is a very long post and lots of information, but if anyone has any advice on how to fix GoW from stuttering/freezing, or if something is wrong with my GPU please let me know. \n\nPic 1: MSI Afterburner & Task Manager after opening GoW\nPic 2: Task Manager GPU utilization after playing GoW for a bit\nPic 3: Task Manager GPU utilization after playing BF6\nPic 4: MSI Afterburner with FPS counter for BF6",

Was using the Glove80 up until I received the Imprint. While I found the Glove80 to be a great keyboard, there were just a few missing features that I wanted, like hot-swappable switches, MX switches, and the integrated trackballs.\n\nInstalled Durock Ice King switches and clear polycarbonate keycaps. Replaced the default black trackballs with Perixx PeriPro-303 purple and green trackballs. I was eyeing the sport balls trackballs from Perixx but they are very expensive.\n\nOrdered the Nylon + Aluminium material, with 5-rows and 5 full bottom row keys. Got the wider palm rest with Bamboo inserts. While the Imprint was made with XDA compatibility in mind, I found that they do fit the tallest Cherry profile keycaps. I am thinking of trying Full metal or ceramic keycaps in the future if they offer all 1u keys.\n\nSome other photos showing the build process. The last photo shows the weight mod I have done, adding an extra 200g of weight to each palm rest, bringing the weight of each palm rest to 270g. I have also did a tape mod and added Poron foam inside the case.",

    "selftext": "I bought a K6 non-pro about a week and a half ago to replace a Logitech membrane keyboards I was getting tired of. While I originally thought to keep it stock I thought I'd make it pop a little. I'm still using the stock keycaps ..and I tossed the gateron blues in it for browns pro v3, though I do have some milky yellow and green apples waiting for something.\n\nWhen I got the board my only intention was to just add the foam to the case, clip the stem feet on the stabs and do a tape mod. Oddly enough the feet on the stabs were already cut despite this being bought new so it saved me on that as it was decently lubed with no rattle or ticking on any stabilizer.\n\nI ended up painting the aluminum pieces. I used chalk paint ..and while it came out okay, it didn't adhere as well as I wanted to as corners had a harder time even after lightly sanding the bare pieces to grab the paint and finish but either way ..good enough cause I don't have a sprayer to have done it differently to get a more consistent finish. I stayed with the stock keycaps as I feel they contrast well with the muted green (pic doesn't do the color justice it's a little more muted like a matcha green color). Unfortunately, I'm skin allergic to pbt so I'm limited to ABS options ..I'm not particularly fond of the polycarbonate keycap sound.\n\nAt the time I was working on this I came across the weikav lucky65 v2 which in waiting to arrive soon. I ended up getting a barebones version along with a set of gmk double shot ABS nightshade clones. So this K6 might end up being shortlived on my desk and live more with my portable devices. I originally wanted to go with gazzew U4T with the lucky65, but unfortunately thanks to tariffs I'd rather wait it out and will instead be pairing it with either the milky yellow or the green apple switches.",

However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup. The library was recently remodeled, and there is also plenty of (free) garage parking next to it.\n\nLooking forward to folks coming out!  \n  \nAlso, thanks yet again to [u/outragedpudding](https://www.reddit.com/user/outragedpudding/) for designing a fabulous [banner](http://i.imgur.com/cpqlgsZ.jpg)!",

Interchanged the switches and that made it better for maybe a couple days and then back to the faulty behavior. since i was out of warranty there is was nothing for me to do in that department.

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn‚Äôt even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn‚Äôt expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

    "selftext": "Review time!\n\nModel: XVX MU68 FujiWave Theme Mechanical Keyboard | XVX/WORMIER\n\nPrice: $100 USD (20% discount for the week of Halloween)\n\nSize: 65%, 68 keys\n\nKeycaps: MOA profile, PBT\n\nHot Swappable?: Yes, switches are pre-lubed & linear I think\n\nGasket Mount: Yes, but there really isn't any flex?\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\n[https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard](https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: no, I didn't get this for free, but they did give me the 20% discount for Halloween after I purchased the keyboard because I was a couple days early for the discount and they said that a reddit review would be very helpful to them and I thought \"wow, that's a great idea. Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

You can find the rest of my posts here, where I'm posting a keyboard every week for a whole year, 52 boards, with 6 down and 46 more to go.\n\nWeek 1: [Vertex Arc60](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1npcvs7/im_posting_a_picture_of_a_different_mechanical/)  \nWeek 2: [Lazydesigners Cloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1ntnjbu/im_posting_a_keyboard_a_week_for_the_next_year/)  \nWeek 3: [Sneakbox AVA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1nzmknb/im_posting_a_keeb_a_week_this_is_week_3_sneakbox/)  \nWeek 4: [Viktus Styrka](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1o5mc5w/week_4_of_posting_a_fresh_board_every_week_for/)  \nWeek 5: [Hola Mini](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1obmwjr/week_5_of_posting_a_fresh_board_every_week_a_year/)\n\nOf course, since I'm going through the trouble to document all of these boards after building such a large collection, I've been adding their finer details to a the [cataloging and sharing app Keebuilder](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/), this way I'll eventually have all of my builds and the parts used in a single place.

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks ‚Äî band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast üôÇ.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me ‚Äî in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn‚Äôt make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they‚Äôll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly ‚Äî The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay‚Äôs voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away ‚Üí Roxette**  \nI‚Äôm still in love with Marie Fredriksson‚Äôs voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 ‚Üí Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele ‚Äî the man, the music, the attitude ‚Äî pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F ‚Üí Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The ‚Äú3‚Äù also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit ‚Äî Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 ‚Üí 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it‚Äôs probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive ‚Üí** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently‚Äôs Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt‚Äôs pure freedom, soul, happiness ‚Äî life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins‚Ä¶ and hopefully Bart‚Äôs story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy ‚Äî build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power ‚Üí N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote ‚Äútuurnn‚Äù next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in ‚Äî just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane ‚Üí** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane ‚Äî the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations ‚Üí** had to be here anyway, but this one‚Äôs a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song‚Äôs energy, Mark‚Äôs wild teenage years, his early work ‚Äî all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we‚Äôre at it‚Ä¶\n\n**P.I.J M.M ‚Üí Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite ‚Äî the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE ‚Üí Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come Through* would‚Äôve been too many ‚Äúdreams‚Äù ‚Äî and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire ‚Üí Scooter (HP Baxxter‚Äôs voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in P√©cs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously ‚Äî the best element!\n\n**Out of Space ‚Üí The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under ‚ÄúSpace‚Äù, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune‚Äôs ‚ÄúI was sent to outer space,‚Äù and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can‚Äôt Stop Raving* didn‚Äôt fit anymore üòÖ.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True ‚Üí** basically the slogan of the ‚Äô90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven‚Äôt outgrown it ‚Äî and honestly, ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù was never my strong suit üôÇ.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? ‚Üí** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I‚Äôve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here ‚Äî sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt need explaining, but I shouldn‚Äôt forget it either.\n* **NRG** ‚Äî same energy.\n* **Music** ‚Äî the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** ‚Äî clich√©, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** ‚Äî probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** ‚Äî took a while to find. Wanted something that says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fit in boxes,‚Äù kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** ‚Äî because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** ‚Äî as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** ‚Äî one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny ‚Äú-drive,‚Äù because if it‚Äôs worth doing, it‚Äôs worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn‚Äôt stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches‚Ä¶ the works.\n\nThat‚Äôs about all that fit ‚Äî for now.  \nI‚Äôve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer ‚Äî brush smears the paint, and I don‚Äôt want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "[RULES UPDATE] Media Only Post, Typing Apps, Games, and Extensions, Combatting Spam",
    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

Was using the Glove80 up until I received the Imprint. While I found the Glove80 to be a great keyboard, there were just a few missing features that I wanted, like hot-swappable switches, MX switches, and the integrated trackballs.\n\nInstalled Durock Ice King switches and clear polycarbonate keycaps. Replaced the default black trackballs with Perixx PeriPro-303 purple and green trackballs. I was eyeing the sport balls trackballs from Perixx but they are very expensive.\n\nOrdered the Nylon + Aluminium material, with 5-rows and 5 full bottom row keys. Got the wider palm rest with Bamboo inserts. While the Imprint was made with XDA compatibility in mind, I found that they do fit the tallest Cherry profile keycaps. I am thinking of trying Full metal or ceramic keycaps in the future if they offer all 1u keys.\n\nSome other photos showing the build process. The last photo shows the weight mod I have done, adding an extra 200g of weight to each palm rest, bringing the weight of each palm rest to 270g. I have also did a tape mod and added Poron foam inside the case.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nJust wanted to share my new keyboard and desk mat combo. \n\nWas using a purple KBD75 v2 keyboard with Mito MT3 laser keycaps for close to 4 years until I damaged the usb C port while I was tidying up my monitor cables. \n\nI've been wanting to get the MiTo GMK Godspeed keycaps for the longest time. I even had the Apollo MT3 version back then, thinking I would build one for it soon. But eventually had to sell the keycaps for other reasons. \n\nFast forward to today, bought the ice blue Evoworks Evo75 and paired it with MiTo GMK Godspeed keycaps and deskmat. \n\nI haven't been keeping up with this hobby for a long time now but I can't believe pre-built keyboards are built this way nowadays. Simply amazing üëå\n\nThank you, Evoworks and for everyone who's keeping this hobby alive and going. From old timers to new timers, all love üíØ\n\n",

    "selftext": "I bought a K6 non-pro about a week and a half ago to replace a Logitech membrane keyboards I was getting tired of. While I originally thought to keep it stock I thought I'd make it pop a little. I'm still using the stock keycaps ..and I tossed the gateron blues in it for browns pro v3, though I do have some milky yellow and green apples waiting for something.\n\nWhen I got the board my only intention was to just add the foam to the case, clip the stem feet on the stabs and do a tape mod. Oddly enough the feet on the stabs were already cut despite this being bought new so it saved me on that as it was decently lubed with no rattle or ticking on any stabilizer.\n\nI ended up painting the aluminum pieces. I used chalk paint ..and while it came out okay, it didn't adhere as well as I wanted to as corners had a harder time even after lightly sanding the bare pieces to grab the paint and finish but either way ..good enough cause I don't have a sprayer to have done it differently to get a more consistent finish. I stayed with the stock keycaps as I feel they contrast well with the muted green (pic doesn't do the color justice it's a little more muted like a matcha green color). Unfortunately, I'm skin allergic to pbt so I'm limited to ABS options ..I'm not particularly fond of the polycarbonate keycap sound.\n\nAt the time I was working on this I came across the weikav lucky65 v2 which in waiting to arrive soon. I ended up getting a barebones version along with a set of gmk double shot ABS nightshade clones. So this K6 might end up being shortlived on my desk and live more with my portable devices. I originally wanted to go with gazzew U4T with the lucky65, but unfortunately thanks to tariffs I'd rather wait it out and will instead be pairing it with either the milky yellow or the green apple switches.",

High St., Dublin, OH 43017)  \nDiscord: [Ohio MK](https://discord.gg/YmPypPj)\n\nWe've been in a bit of a scramble since our previous venue shut down, but thankfully we were able to pull something together before the end of the year!\n\n**No tickets are required**, thanks to the library having a free space for us to use. However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup. The library was recently remodeled, and there is also plenty of (free) garage parking next to it.\n\nLooking forward to folks coming out!  \n  \nAlso, thanks yet again to [u/outragedpudding](https://www.reddit.com/user/outragedpudding/) for designing a fabulous [banner](http://i.imgur.com/cpqlgsZ.jpg)!",

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn‚Äôt even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn‚Äôt expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

Was using the Glove80 up until I received the Imprint. While I found the Glove80 to be a great keyboard, there were just a few missing features that I wanted, like hot-swappable switches, MX switches, and the integrated trackballs.\n\nInstalled Durock Ice King switches and clear polycarbonate keycaps. Replaced the default black trackballs with Perixx PeriPro-303 purple and green trackballs. I was eyeing the sport balls trackballs from Perixx but they are very expensive.\n\nOrdered the Nylon + Aluminium material, with 5-rows and 5 full bottom row keys. Got the wider palm rest with Bamboo inserts. While the Imprint was made with XDA compatibility in mind, I found that they do fit the tallest Cherry profile keycaps. I am thinking of trying Full metal or ceramic keycaps in the future if they offer all 1u keys.\n\nSome other photos showing the build process. The last photo shows the weight mod I have done, adding an extra 200g of weight to each palm rest, bringing the weight of each palm rest to 270g. I have also did a tape mod and added Poron foam inside the case.",

    "selftext": "I bought a K6 non-pro about a week and a half ago to replace a Logitech membrane keyboards I was getting tired of. While I originally thought to keep it stock I thought I'd make it pop a little. I'm still using the stock keycaps ..and I tossed the gateron blues in it for browns pro v3, though I do have some milky yellow and green apples waiting for something.\n\nWhen I got the board my only intention was to just add the foam to the case, clip the stem feet on the stabs and do a tape mod. Oddly enough the feet on the stabs were already cut despite this being bought new so it saved me on that as it was decently lubed with no rattle or ticking on any stabilizer.\n\nI ended up painting the aluminum pieces. I used chalk paint ..and while it came out okay, it didn't adhere as well as I wanted to as corners had a harder time even after lightly sanding the bare pieces to grab the paint and finish but either way ..good enough cause I don't have a sprayer to have done it differently to get a more consistent finish. I stayed with the stock keycaps as I feel they contrast well with the muted green (pic doesn't do the color justice it's a little more muted like a matcha green color). Unfortunately, I'm skin allergic to pbt so I'm limited to ABS options ..I'm not particularly fond of the polycarbonate keycap sound.\n\nAt the time I was working on this I came across the weikav lucky65 v2 which in waiting to arrive soon. I ended up getting a barebones version along with a set of gmk double shot ABS nightshade clones. So this K6 might end up being shortlived on my desk and live more with my portable devices. I originally wanted to go with gazzew U4T with the lucky65, but unfortunately thanks to tariffs I'd rather wait it out and will instead be pairing it with either the milky yellow or the green apple switches.",

However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup. The library was recently remodeled, and there is also plenty of (free) garage parking next to it.\n\nLooking forward to folks coming out!  \n  \nAlso, thanks yet again to [u/outragedpudding](https://www.reddit.com/user/outragedpudding/) for designing a fabulous [banner](http://i.imgur.com/cpqlgsZ.jpg)!",

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.",

It's also 24'', which is my preferred size for a monitor. Only problem is that this monitor doesn't seem to be available for a sensible price in my country (Sweden), and neither is its closest competitor Asus vg259qm.\n\nBest options seem to be:\n-Asus vg249qm1a: Seems to be a slightly smaller version of the vg259qm with 270hz instead of 280hz. Haven't seen any in depth reviews of it, and it seems like it's actually a 240hz monitor with an overclock feature to 270hz. In my experience, usually when a cheaper monitor has an overclock feaure it is dogshit, but the standard refreshrate of 240hz is still good enough.\n\n-AOC 25g4sxu: Again a monitor that is sometimes advertised as a 300hz monitor but is actually just a 240hz monitor with an overclock feature. This one I have actually seen a pretty good review of and it seems like it's a good option for 240hz but the overclock feature should really be ignored. This is probably my favourite option so far since I know pretty much what I'll be getting. Would kinda suck if my 2 other options are better so that's why I'm making this post, to see if any of you nerds have any more info.\n\n-MSI mag 255xf: a 300hz monitor that I don't really know anything about.\n\nWhich one do you think I should go for?\n\n\n ",

Also, no embedded frame generation/interpolation technologies would be better (I would like to be able to program the displayed video frame by frame).\n* Screen size : quite open, anything from 24\" to way above would work, but 27-42 inches would be a sweet spot.\n\nI have had a hard time finding a monitor satisfying both requirements, as most modern 3D screens come with either glasses-free or active 3D approaches, which are not suitable for my application.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my experience after testing several 24‚Äù gaming monitors over the past few weeks. Hopefully this helps anyone trying to decide between these models. All of them were intended for 1080p gaming setups.\n\n**1. PHILIPS Evnia 24M2N3201A/00, 180Hz (1 white model and 3 black ones)**\n\nAll 4 units were returned for the same reason: severe backlight bleeding, especially in the top-left corner where two bright spots were very noticeable.\nOther than that, colors were excellent, the built-in speakers were decent, and 180Hz performed smoothly. If not for the aggressive bleeding, this would‚Äôve been my top choice.\n\n**2. ASUS TUF VG249Q1R, 23.8‚Äù, 165Hz**\n\nDidn‚Äôt get to test this one extensively, but it showed similar backlight bleeding to the Philips. Otherwise, performance and build felt comparable, nothing major to complain about, but nothing outstanding either.\n \n**3. Lenovo Legion R25f-30, 24.5‚Äù, 280Hz (actually 240Hz, but u can OC it to 280)**\n\nUsed this one for about a week. It had the least noticeable bleeding of all, just a thin, faint line on the left edge of the screen. However, color calibration was too damn tricky. It took a while to get a semi-decent look.\nWhat worked best for me was enabling 10-bit color in the NVIDIA Control Panel (with nvidia color settings as well) and/or switching to DisplayPort 1.2 (which only gives u 8bpc) instead of the default 1.4 mode. \nOnce tuned, it looked usable and performed great for high-refresh gaming. The 240hz were awesome. But I returned it because my eyes were hurting because of the colors. \n\n**4. TCL 25G64, 24.5‚Äù, QD-Mini LED, 300Hz**\n\nCurrently using this one. It also shows noticeable backlight bleed, similar to the Philips, but local dimming helps a lot. It‚Äôll only show a tiny bit in a corner after using the LM settings. But there‚Äôs a trade-off: with local dimming ON, brightness adjusts dynamically when switching windows and this can be annoying for some, I don‚Äôt really like it and if you turn it OFF, the bleeding returns.\n\nBut other than that, it‚Äôs really, really bright (my brightness is set to 40), colors are vivid, and it feels the most ‚Äúpremium‚Äù overall.\n\nThe overall **conclusion** is that if you‚Äôre sensitive to backlight bleeding, none of these are perfect.\nThey all have ups and downs. \n\nJust wanted to share this in case someone‚Äôs stuck choosing between these models, I hope it saves you some time (and returns üòÖ).\n\nGood luck and happy gaming! \n",

This is the first time I'm buying a monitor with some research behind it, so I'd appreciate some opinions.\n\n  \nMy use case is:\n\n* No gaming at all\n* Work/productivity focused. I read text... a lot.\n* I enjoy movies\n* No HDR.\n\nI had hoped that given my use case I could find a bargain with low refresh rate, No HDR requirement(my beat up ol' thinkpad has only hdmi 1.4), no need for fast response, but I've found such candidates are from local small-time oem brands with suspicious reputations. \n\nI searched around a lot on if I want VA or IPS, but after some intensive reading that what I found was that VAs have such a varying quality being a VA (or not) in itself doesn't seem to be the deciding factor.\n\nSome of the candidates I looked at:\n\n* Samsung S27F610\n* LG 27U631A\n* Samsung Odyssey G5 S27CG550\n* Samsung Odyssey G5 C32G54T - for some reason, this is selling at the same price as the one above, despite being 32 incher.\n* LG 27GS60QC\n\nThese are all under USD 200. If all else equal, I narrowed it down to either LG or Samsung, because around here those are the only brands I can be assured I'll have no issue using A/S. I know this sub's frequent recommendations are AOC Q27G3XMN miniLED or among LG's, 27GS85Q, or Samsung's higher Odyssey lineups, but those are really out of my budget. I understand these are not the most popular models in this sub but if any of you have experience to share I'd be very grateful.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve had an LG TN panel monitor for about five years now. It actually came with my first computer for college, and back then I didn‚Äôt even know there were different panel types like VA, TN, IPS, and so on.\n\nVideo editing and digital art have always been hobbies of mine, and lately I‚Äôve been doing them more professionally. I‚Äôve never had any major issues, but it does bother me sometimes when I notice that certain colors or tones look different on my phone than they do on my monitor. I eventually found out that‚Äôs because TN panels just aren‚Äôt that great when it comes to color accuracy.\n\nSince Christmas isn‚Äôt too far away, I thought it might be a good time to treat myself to a better monitor. While researching, I found the Asus ProArt series, and it was actually my top pick for quite a while (For context, I‚Äôm leaning toward the 24-inch version since it‚Äôs the most affordable, and anything bigger would take up too much space in my setup.). I really like the built-in ruler on the frame and the extra USB ports. But then I saw a few comments from people saying they had issues with color accuracy or that the resolution didn‚Äôt look as sharp as expected.\n\nOn top of that, I‚Äôve been getting ads for other IPS monitors lately, mostly gaming-focused ones, and they caught my eye too. Most of them are a little cheaper than the Asus, though not all of them have the same features I liked about the ProArt line.\n\nSo I‚Äôm wondering, is it really worth investing in the Asus for those extra features, or would pretty much any decent IPS panel do the job? If so, I'm open to suggestions of what I should get instead\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pevca7r9y5yf1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=4221f682567459969aec071a21d0b0be9649f3c7\n\n",

    "title": "My experience testing 4 different 24‚Äù Full HD gaming monitors",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my experience after testing several 24‚Äù gaming monitors over the past few weeks. Hopefully this helps anyone trying to decide between these models. All of them were intended for 1080p gaming setups.\n\n**1. PHILIPS Evnia 24M2N3201A/00, 180Hz (1 white model and 3 black ones)**\n\nAll 4 units were returned for the same reason: severe backlight bleeding, especially in the top-left corner where two bright spots were very noticeable.\nOther than that, colors were excellent, the built-in speakers were decent, and 180Hz performed smoothly. If not for the aggressive bleeding, this would‚Äôve been my top choice.\n\n**2. ASUS TUF VG249Q1R, 23.8‚Äù, 165Hz**\n\nDidn‚Äôt get to test this one extensively, but it showed similar backlight bleeding to the Philips. Otherwise, performance and build felt comparable, nothing major to complain about, but nothing outstanding either.\n \n**3. Lenovo Legion R25f-30, 24.5‚Äù, 280Hz (actually 240Hz, but u can OC it to 280)**\n\nUsed this one for about a week. It had the least noticeable bleeding of all, just a thin, faint line on the left edge of the screen. However, color calibration was too damn tricky. It took a while to get a semi-decent look.\nWhat worked best for me was enabling 10-bit color in the NVIDIA Control Panel (with nvidia color settings as well) and/or switching to DisplayPort 1.2 (which only gives u 8bpc) instead of the default 1.4 mode. \nOnce tuned, it looked usable and performed great for high-refresh gaming. The 240hz were awesome. But I returned it because my eyes were hurting because of the colors. \n\n**4. TCL 25G64, 24.5‚Äù, QD-Mini LED, 300Hz**\n\nCurrently using this one. It also shows noticeable backlight bleed, similar to the Philips, but local dimming helps a lot. It‚Äôll only show a tiny bit in a corner after using the LM settings. But there‚Äôs a trade-off: with local dimming ON, brightness adjusts dynamically when switching windows and this can be annoying for some, I don‚Äôt really like it and if you turn it OFF, the bleeding returns.\n\nBut other than that, it‚Äôs really, really bright (my brightness is set to 40), colors are vivid, and it feels the most ‚Äúpremium‚Äù overall.\n\nThe overall **conclusion** is that if you‚Äôre sensitive to backlight bleeding, none of these are perfect.\nThey all have ups and downs. \n\nJust wanted to share this in case someone‚Äôs stuck choosing between these models, I hope it saves you some time (and returns üòÖ).\n\nGood luck and happy gaming! \n",

It's also 24'', which is my preferred size for a monitor. Only problem is that this monitor doesn't seem to be available for a sensible price in my country (Sweden), and neither is its closest competitor Asus vg259qm.\n\nBest options seem to be:\n-Asus vg249qm1a: Seems to be a slightly smaller version of the vg259qm with 270hz instead of 280hz. Haven't seen any in depth reviews of it, and it seems like it's actually a 240hz monitor with an overclock feature to 270hz. In my experience, usually when a cheaper monitor has an overclock feaure it is dogshit, but the standard refreshrate of 240hz is still good enough.\n\n-AOC 25g4sxu: Again a monitor that is sometimes advertised as a 300hz monitor but is actually just a 240hz monitor with an overclock feature. This one I have actually seen a pretty good review of and it seems like it's a good option for 240hz but the overclock feature should really be ignored. This is probably my favourite option so far since I know pretty much what I'll be getting. Would kinda suck if my 2 other options are better so that's why I'm making this post, to see if any of you nerds have any more info.\n\n-MSI mag 255xf: a 300hz monitor that I don't really know anything about.\n\nWhich one do you think I should go for?\n\n\n ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am looking for a monitor with specific specs :\n\n* **Passive 3D** capabilities : by passive, I mean that the separation for both eyes must come from light polarization and passive glasses, and not from active glasses involving some shutter/obstruction synchronized with the refresh rate\n* **High Refresh Rate :** I'm looking for at least 120Hz, but the more the better ! Also, no embedded frame generation/interpolation technologies would be better (I would like to be able to program the displayed video frame by frame).\n* Screen size : quite open, anything from 24\" to way above would work, but 27-42 inches would be a sweet spot.\n\nI have had a hard time finding a monitor satisfying both requirements, as most modern 3D screens come with either glasses-free or active 3D approaches, which are not suitable for my application. I think LG might be the most promising brand, as they seem to have worked a lot on passive 3D a few years ago, but I am having difficulties to find older references online, and am not too sure what the refresh rates advertised refer to (TruMotion for example, might be an embedded frame interpolation tech). \n\nI am open to old/discontinued references, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks a lot !",

I would like my 9070XT to last a few years, which is why 1440p would be better, but I also use the monitor as a streaming/TV replacement. What are your experiences? Is 1440p perhaps suitable for movies? How would the image look compared to 1080p? Wouldn't it be possible to use 4k and render all games or games that require it in 1440p using FSR? I also think that newer games all support FSR and older games should run in just fine with my 9070XT at 4k. I don't need 140fps since I don't play competitive games.  \nThank you in advance.",

I read text... a lot.\n* I enjoy movies\n* No HDR.\n\nI had hoped that given my use case I could find a bargain with low refresh rate, No HDR requirement(my beat up ol' thinkpad has only hdmi 1.4), no need for fast response, but I've found such candidates are from local small-time oem brands with suspicious reputations. \n\nI searched around a lot on if I want VA or IPS, but after some intensive reading that what I found was that VAs have such a varying quality being a VA (or not) in itself doesn't seem to be the deciding factor.\n\nSome of the candidates I looked at:\n\n* Samsung S27F610\n* LG 27U631A\n* Samsung Odyssey G5 S27CG550\n* Samsung Odyssey G5 C32G54T - for some reason, this is selling at the same price as the one above, despite being 32 incher.\n* LG 27GS60QC\n\nThese are all under USD 200. If all else equal, I narrowed it down to either LG or Samsung, because around here those are the only brands I can be assured I'll have no issue using A/S. I know this sub's frequent recommendations are AOC Q27G3XMN miniLED or among LG's, 27GS85Q, or Samsung's higher Odyssey lineups, but those are really out of my budget. I understand these are not the most popular models in this sub but if any of you have experience to share I'd be very grateful.\n\n",

    "selftext": "(see my edit at the bottom)\n\nSince my one year anniversary of getting the AW3423DWF on a Black Friday deal last year was coming up I thought I'd throw some grey slides up to see how it was handling burn-in. Well... as you can see, not great. Unfortunately, now that I know it's there I'm seeing it all the time in dark scenes. I haven't gamed in a while and pulled up Alan Wake 2 and there it is.\n\nNormally I do a lot of mixed viewing, but lately it's been sitting on the desktop more than usual. It also seems to have this weird quirk where it constantly wakes out of standby and just sits on if I don't turn fully turn it off, so I'm sure that contributed. It seems to hate wanting to sleep or allow a black screen saver. I ran a manual panel refresh and pixel refresh and it made no difference.\n\nOh well, time to see how well the warranty holds up!\n\nAnyone prefer going through Dell or Best Buy? Since it was on a large discount I added on the four year Geek Squad coverage and thinking it may be easier just to bring it down there and swap same day rather than the headache of Dell.\n\nEdit: I have a theory as to why this burn-in was particularly bad in case other people read this post later. Yes, icons and wallpaper contributed, but others have mentioned that they haven't see such dramatic burn in even with those. Ever since I got this monitor I've been struggling to keep it in standby when not in use, despite having a 5 minute black screensaver and 10 minute standby. I would find it randomly awake and it wouldn't go back to sleep unless I forced it. I'd see it sleep and then immediately wake up, or walk away and come back to find it on. (I'm talking about the monitor, not PC).\n\nWell, I think I fixed it after finding another thread on this: **input auto-select needs to be turned off in the monitor menu**. For some reason it would keep it from sleeping properly. I just tried it and it worked perfectly and now immediately enters the pixel refresh like it's supposed to. I have a feeling that this bug was kicking it out of standby constantly and not letting it do a refresh every four hours, despite being set to. That would have definitely made burn in worse if it was only doing it at night when I shut the PC off and not during the day.\n\nNo idea if this is the smoking gun, but it likely contributed.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my experience after testing several 24‚Äù gaming monitors over the past few weeks. Hopefully this helps anyone trying to decide between these models. All of them were intended for 1080p gaming setups.\n\n**1. PHILIPS Evnia 24M2N3201A/00, 180Hz (1 white model and 3 black ones)**\n\nAll 4 units were returned for the same reason: severe backlight bleeding, especially in the top-left corner where two bright spots were very noticeable.\nOther than that, colors were excellent, the built-in speakers were decent, and 180Hz performed smoothly. If not for the aggressive bleeding, this would‚Äôve been my top choice.\n\n**2. ASUS TUF VG249Q1R, 23.8‚Äù, 165Hz**\n\nDidn‚Äôt get to test this one extensively, but it showed similar backlight bleeding to the Philips. Otherwise, performance and build felt comparable, nothing major to complain about, but nothing outstanding either.\n \n**3. Lenovo Legion R25f-30, 24.5‚Äù, 280Hz (actually 240Hz, but u can OC it to 280)**\n\nUsed this one for about a week. It had the least noticeable bleeding of all, just a thin, faint line on the left edge of the screen. However, color calibration was too damn tricky. It took a while to get a semi-decent look.\nWhat worked best for me was enabling 10-bit color in the NVIDIA Control Panel (with nvidia color settings as well) and/or switching to DisplayPort 1.2 (which only gives u 8bpc) instead of the default 1.4 mode. \nOnce tuned, it looked usable and performed great for high-refresh gaming. The 240hz were awesome. But I returned it because my eyes were hurting because of the colors. \n\n**4. TCL 25G64, 24.5‚Äù, QD-Mini LED, 300Hz**\n\nCurrently using this one. It also shows noticeable backlight bleed, similar to the Philips, but local dimming helps a lot. It‚Äôll only show a tiny bit in a corner after using the LM settings. But there‚Äôs a trade-off: with local dimming ON, brightness adjusts dynamically when switching windows and this can be annoying for some, I don‚Äôt really like it and if you turn it OFF, the bleeding returns.\n\nBut other than that, it‚Äôs really, really bright (my brightness is set to 40), colors are vivid, and it feels the most ‚Äúpremium‚Äù overall.\n\nThe overall **conclusion** is that if you‚Äôre sensitive to backlight bleeding, none of these are perfect.\nThey all have ups and downs. \n\nJust wanted to share this in case someone‚Äôs stuck choosing between these models, I hope it saves you some time (and returns üòÖ).\n\nGood luck and happy gaming! \n",

It's also 24'', which is my preferred size for a monitor. Only problem is that this monitor doesn't seem to be available for a sensible price in my country (Sweden), and neither is its closest competitor Asus vg259qm.\n\nBest options seem to be:\n-Asus vg249qm1a: Seems to be a slightly smaller version of the vg259qm with 270hz instead of 280hz. Haven't seen any in depth reviews of it, and it seems like it's actually a 240hz monitor with an overclock feature to 270hz. In my experience, usually when a cheaper monitor has an overclock feaure it is dogshit, but the standard refreshrate of 240hz is still good enough.\n\n-AOC 25g4sxu: Again a monitor that is sometimes advertised as a 300hz monitor but is actually just a 240hz monitor with an overclock feature. This one I have actually seen a pretty good review of and it seems like it's a good option for 240hz but the overclock feature should really be ignored. This is probably my favourite option so far since I know pretty much what I'll be getting. Would kinda suck if my 2 other options are better so that's why I'm making this post, to see if any of you nerds have any more info.\n\n-MSI mag 255xf: a 300hz monitor that I don't really know anything about.\n\nWhich one do you think I should go for?\n\n\n ",

Also, no embedded frame generation/interpolation technologies would be better (I would like to be able to program the displayed video frame by frame).\n* Screen size : quite open, anything from 24\" to way above would work, but 27-42 inches would be a sweet spot.\n\nI have had a hard time finding a monitor satisfying both requirements, as most modern 3D screens come with either glasses-free or active 3D approaches, which are not suitable for my application.

    "selftext": "So you decide to upgrade your audio setup with a nice pair of headphones. BuT WhAt PaIr Of HeAdPhOnEs? You ask. Well here it is a guide to headphone tuning.\n\nSo first off there needs to be a disclaimer being no matter what headphones you buy, they will not sound perfect to you. Sonic \"perfection\" is entirely unique to you with complex ideas like HRTF and more importantly how that noggin of yours processes sounds. To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

    "selftext": "Hello, I haven‚Äôt really seen much coverage of this product online, and I thought it deserves some more attention so I will try to share my thoughts.\n\nThis headphone is not available in many countries, but I was able to buy it from Aliexpress for around ¬£20($26) including postage. A retro-style lightweight Bluetooth openback headphones from Philips to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\n\nIn this product category, the closest competitor I could think of is Koss porta pro, Kph30i or the wireless koss porta pro all of which cost more than this product. I‚Äôve also compared it to some grados and my HD6XX and HD560s.\n\nGiven the price range, I was shocked at the tonal balance and the resolution. I would say Grado and Koss both have a very distinct texture of sound that makes it sound really cheap with little bass. In my ears, Ringo definitely has a more balanced V shape sound signature and has less of that cheap texture to the sound. Given my experience and preference, I would take this over Grado SR60/80i/e or Koss porta pro/kph30 any day for its timbre and tuning even if it was the same price point.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, the resolution or timbre isn‚Äôt gonna beat an HD6XX, and the build is quite cheap. But I find the build with its metal headband more sturdy than any of the Koss headphones that can even be triple the price. For a fun sounding Bluetooth headphones with 26 hour battery, lightweight and decent retro design AND built in app eq for around ¬£20 is crazy. \n\nI‚Äôve got too many headphones and have bought all the headphones mentioned in this review, but I will be keeping these around which is the biggest compliment I can give as I have given away/sold the all the Koss products. I‚Äôm no expert and have no intention to try over selling these but for anyone who‚Äôs considering a sub 100 open back Bluetooth headphones, these are the best in my experience!",

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. After many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they‚Äôd be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. After about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. I love these headphones and all the things the 600 family can‚Äôt do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. Anyway, I have only really listened to the suede pads so far, but both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. The drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family, at least visually from the outside, but they focus on things like a fun but balanced tonal curve while providing a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the widest soundstage I‚Äôve heard from a Sennheiser, it‚Äôs not even close. That being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. As someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. Weirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop‚Ä¶ I know what you want me to say, but I don‚Äôt hate them. They‚Äôre definitely not the headphone I‚Äôm going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I‚Äôm hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes. I absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is nasty. I will be buying a new cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro‚Äôs are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you‚Äôve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I‚Äôd love to hear other‚Äôs perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I‚Äôll get.",

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

No balanced, no DSP, just a power putton, volume dial and headphone ports. I love it. This might sound silly, but I really enjoy having dedicated 3.5mm and 1/4inch ports so I never have to use an annoying adapter anymore.\n\nI rarely see products of this company anywhere online, so I wanted to share it with you all (although you might know them by their high-end brand \"Violectric\"). This costs 240‚Ç¨, is built like a tank and - something I also rarely see marketed about - is proud of the built-in headphone protection circuits.

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nAs the title suggests, DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. I do not mean that as a joke, these cans are audio garbage and I don't know why folks keep buying them. \nI'm making this review based on memory from a couple months ago since I basically got rid of them as soon as they came.\n\nBass: DISTORTED BLOATED DUMPSTER FIRE.\nOh boy the bass on these is absolutely horrid, I actually thought something was wrong with my pair until I looked at the distortion charts and yep it aligns with what I heard. \nSubbass: rolled off and flabby at the same time, no matter how I powered it. It was just very farty and anything close to normal volume made it sound extremely sad. I am not joking when I say this but an HD600 with a subbass shelf has cleaner bass. IT CANNOT DO SUBBASS EVEN STOCK.\n\nMids: actually not too bad, nothing to write home about. I honestly don't know what to say about it except for its mediocre and VERY IN YOUR FACE. Suicideboys was the only artist that sounded okay.\n\nHighs: OH BOY IT GETS WORSE, there is something real nasty goin on in the low-mid treble. This was something that could not be fixed with mods or whatever I did. Maybe it's a reflection or resonance from the driver cover? I tried everything in the book and I could not fix it.\nBut anyway, the treble wasn't fun. It was a hazy mess, any track sounded sharp and not detailed at the same time. I can accept being slightly piercing IF there is a good amount of detail output.\n\nThe baseline is that there are WAYYY better cans at the same price. I have also seen DMS recommending them and I can sort of understand why since his listening volume is extremely low (compared to mine) and doesn't run into the same distortion problems (I think).",

    "selftext": "I feel lied to! All over this sub, and other IEM subs have repeatedly said, \"If you can get it loud enough then you don't need an amp!\" LIES!\n\nI went to a headphone shop today, I brought my own dongle DAC/Amp. Tried a bunch of headphones. You know what? Yes I could get the demo units up to par listening volume. It was loud enough. Didn't even need to get to 80% volume for it to be loud. Huh, sounds decent.\n\nThen the guy said to try it with a dedicated desktop amp. I plugged it in, and lo' and behold, the audio is richer, soundstage is bigger, the headphones came ALIVE. Before, it was tinny and flat, but loud enough. Crazily, with the amp, the volume was actually set lower. Did I volume match? No, but I didn't need to because I could hear the difference before I got to the same volume. \n\nI always turn the volume down to zero before swapping anything. Before I even got halfway there to the same volume, I could already hear how much richer the sound was.\n\nFYI, it was a Samsung S22 Ultra -> Luxury & Precision W4 -> 4.4mm Out, this was the dongle DAC setup that actually sounds quite phenomenal for IEMs, but with headphones the W4 simply could not produce enough juice to *really drive* the headphones (HiFiMAN Edition XS). \n\nSo, do you need an amp if you are using headphones? The technical answer is no, but if you want to get the best out of it, then yes you do.",

    "title": "CVJ Neko: CVJ Neko: bass that hits and voices that whisper.",
    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n‚Üí Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n‚Üí Punchy bass.  \n‚Üí Delicious female vocals.  \n‚Üí Soundstage above average.  \n‚Üí No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n‚Üí DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n‚Üí If you are a purist, stay away.  \n‚Üí Mids somewhat soft.  \n‚Üí Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30‚Ç¨/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a ‚Äúmore and better.‚Äù\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:**¬†present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:**¬†this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:**¬†here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:**¬†somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:**¬†maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:**¬†with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:**¬†substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:**¬†too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:**¬†I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:**¬†at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:**¬†placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:**¬†keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:**¬†could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:**¬†testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko‚Äôs character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos‚Äô voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:**¬†testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once‚Ä¶ I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:**¬†dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:**¬†not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:**¬†paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:**¬†I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it‚Äôs unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you have fun‚Äù vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

This makes me suspect that my iPhone 17 Pro might have a defect in its audio chip or a related component. When I played the same songs on my older iPhone 13 Pro using AAC, there was no distortion. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have a Lightning dongle, so I couldn‚Äôt test aptX on the older phone. And also I have dropout problem when using both dongle.Does anyone else with an iPhone 17 series notice these issues?\n\nMy personal experience with these three little friends:\n\nYou really can‚Äôt go wrong with either dongle.\n\nQCC Pro\n\nHas its own app with a much better UX design. The slim form factor fits perfectly on a phone or tablet. Looks more premium in person (the photos make it seem cheaper than it is). Comes with only one dongle ‚Äî I originally thought there were two (one for the phone and one for the headphones that communicate directly), which would‚Äôve justified the higher price over the BTD700. The packaging design is a bit misleading.\n\nBTD700\n\nWorks great for home or office use.Doesn‚Äôt have a mobile app, but there‚Äôs one for PC/Mac. Sadly, I couldn‚Äôt update the firmware no matter what system I used. But it works. One simple button does everything you need.\n\nIn terms of sound, they‚Äôre very similar. I can only tell the difference when comparing side by side ‚Äî the QCC Pro‚Äôs mids are slightly louder and more forward.\n\nIf you like the QCC Pro‚Äôs design but prefer the BTD700‚Äôs price, check out the QCC Standard (white) version. I believe only Bloom Audio carries it, and they‚Äôre an awesome retailer. Please remember, Only QCC PRO Has LDAC.\n\nAbout the PX8 S2\n\nThey‚Äôre extremely comfortable. My head circumference is about 21.5\", and I‚Äôm very sensitive ‚Äî even picky ‚Äî about anything pressing on my head (I can‚Äôt stand most beanies). But I can wear the PX8 S2 for long sessions with no problem. My old XM3s and AirPods Max felt like Jigsaw‚Äôs traps in comparison.\n\nThe leather is incredibly soft ‚Äî genuinely reminiscent of Herm√®s leather. If you or your HAPPY WIFE have Herm√®s bags, you‚Äôll know what I mean.\n\nAs for sound quality, the PX8 S2 really shines with large-scale or orchestral music. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not good for solo performances ‚Äî I love listening to Yo-Yo Ma with them. For pop music, it‚Äôs more about personal preference. The sound is very balanced ‚Äî I like it a lot, but as I like to say, I like drinking water‚Ä¶ and you might not.\n\n\\*I use gpt to make my post more readable and I also post this review on B&W subreddit. Any advice or question are welcome\n\n",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/2flmc5e914yf1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=70db2ea529ba5f5b1230ac28b4d91c7ec2cfedce\n\nSo, I want to talk about DACs. Personally, I‚Äôm not a believer in all that snake oil ‚Äî people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don‚Äôt buy it. And honestly, I don‚Äôt think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I‚Äôve always thought that if there‚Äôs any difference, it‚Äôs basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time ‚Äî I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a ‚Äúbigger soundstage,‚Äù I just assume it‚Äôs because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I‚Äôm open-minded ‚Äî I‚Äôll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that‚Äôs matched, everything else ‚Äî bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging ‚Äî sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I‚Äôm out. Either they‚Äôre trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don‚Äôt. In either case, their opinions don‚Äôt mean much to me anymore, because I can‚Äôt hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let‚Äôs talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn‚Äôt tell exactly what at first, but it didn‚Äôt feel like my imagination. After more testing ‚Äî switching headphones, replaying the same tracks ‚Äî I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head ‚Äî especially those higher notes ‚Äî in a way the K7 doesn‚Äôt. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that‚Äôs somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it‚Äôs like their voice locks into one spot ‚Äî more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this ‚Äî it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you ‚Äî same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat‚Äôs not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer‚Äôs right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste ‚Äî some benefit from that extra space, some don‚Äôt. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** ‚Äî *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn‚Äôt huge, but it‚Äôs there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It‚Äôs actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it‚Äôs slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less ‚Äúexciting.‚Äù The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah ‚Äî I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It‚Äôs pricey, and there‚Äôs no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat‚Äôs my honest take.",

    "selftext": "So I previously had upgraded from some generic brand headphones to the JBL Quantum One's. They blew me away - I hadn't been expecting an actual increase in audio quality, just that they'd be more comfortable to wear, but they were noticeably better on audio quality, by what seemed like a significant amount.\n\nMore recently (a few months ago) my first set got to the point that I decided it was time for a replacement set. That one had connectivity issues straight out of the box: every time I'd move or turn my head *even slightly*, the connection would quit and I'd have to unplug and re-plug them in again.\n\nEventually I got tired of this and bought a *third* set. Which also, immediately out of the box, gave me the same issue. I switched the wires I was using - since each set came with it's own - but the problem persisted.\n\nAt this point, I'm just beyond done fiddling with these obscene excuses of technology and want to find something I won't have to worry about replacing multiple times to get a functioning set from.",

    "title": "Advice for the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs 80ohm Headphones",
    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

This is usually resolved by installing the USB DAC driver provided by the maker, but [SMSL does not have such a driver for the R1](https://www.smsl-audio.com/portal/product/downlist/id/11.html).\n\nThe sound when the treble/bass sliders are set to flat and EQ is set to 1 (neutral) is decent, soundstage is wide and imaging is pleasing. I would say it sounds as good as any good dongle DAC out there. The volume dial stepping is digital, and its 0% volume rest position is around 8 o'clock but audio cannot be heard until the dial moves to just above 8 o'clock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unh2e5uyb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=543c5fadfb1cc44339cf3758d73cf601b3a33d75\n\nWhen all processing is flat/off there is no noticeable distortion even at high volume on both HE1000se and HD600. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih4wc1k5c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=729948d649f5ce4ddf421d1be1c21acebfcce333\n\nThe power output is 130mW so quite low, but it's capable of driving both headphones just fine and loud.\n\nWhen you enable any EQ or adjust the tone controls, distortion comes in at higher volumes especially noticed in songs with bass or audio with bass, so for gamers playing shooters, this is a big issue if you want to tone control or use one of the better EQ presets as flat is just that and lacks any smoothness/warmth in sound signature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j87meo97c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76683158a5dc1f033677e071151592f4e455520c\n\nUsing it is a DAC only and pre-amp using the RCA outputs to the power amp it does an OK job although there is noticeable noise floor interference that can be heard, just like what I found with the Creek 4040A a while back. Seems the analogue circuitry is not isolated.\n\nI then plugged in the RCA interconnect between the X9 and power amp to test and heard no noticeable interference noise. In this config the power amp was set to bypass and R1 used as pre-amp, in pure DAC mode and volume controlling via the power amp, the same noise can be heard once you increase the power amp's volume, the R1's volume is maxed out in this test to imitate bypass and be DAC only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r54td2q8c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3de0a8271051809a0c92c11c9a8c9092c9be0307\n\nIt is priced at $71 currently, I think if you must have a desktop sitting box to use and interact with then ok it's fine, but these caveats have to be considered. Otherwise I would say the ONIX Alpha XI1 offers better sound with none of the distortion issues or noise etc at a slightly higher price and offers more power, lower THD+N.\n\nThe other advantage of the R1 though is it has dedicated mic input, although if you are a gamer you almost certainly have a USB mic or headset anyway so this is not really a selling factor.\n\nThe volume dial is super slick though, there is that....\n\nI was unable to open up the housing properly for a teardown as even with all the screws out, I could not lift out the top panel with the sliders properly without fearing breaking something. Either it is glued on, or there is a method to it.",

    "selftext": "I work a desk job where I'm on the phone at least half the day. I got sick of the provided headset so I bought this set for work, being wireless, good battery life, good mic features (that noise fence tech is the real MVP). Usually I'll wear these over a set of flathead IEMs when I'm on the phone. These can do dual connection with BT and the usb dongle, just never really thought to use them for my phone. I forgot my IEMs going into the office the other day, so I set up the BT for music and HOT DAMN.\n  \nWith ANC on these are absolute bass cannons. The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these. If you're a fellow bass head and need something for a job with remote communication, 10/10 I suggest these.",

    "selftext": "Today I received the brand-new FiiO K13 R2R DAC/AMP, which I picked up mainly out of curiosity to explore the sound signature of R2R technology. My current setup includes the Topping DX5 II, which absolutely shines with electronic genres (rave, techno, acid, house, IDM, EDM) you name it.. It delivers dynamic, crystal-clear audio with a wide soundstage and stunning detail. Paired with the Arya Organic, it's a near-perfect match for me, of course, within this price range.\n\nHowever, when it comes to vocals, film scores, classic rock, or pop, the DX5 II can feel a bit too clinical,,almost overly precise. That‚Äôs exactly why I decided to try the K13, hoping for a warmer, more organic presentation thanks to the R2R DAC.\n\nA/B testing starts today, and I‚Äôll share a more detailed review over the weekend. If you‚Äôve got experience with the K13 or other R2R DACs, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!",

But this is my office, and although I do have a nice stereo system here, headphones are sometimes more adequate. I've recently got a pair of Sennheiser HD600s, powered by a Fiio K11 R2R, and they work fine.\n\n  \nPerhaps my questions are more on the subject of headphones than of this one in particular, maybe. I use Sonus Faber Sonettos here, and I absolutely love them. The headphones just seem \"constrained\" maybe. I am not good at describing such things. But they seem to be lacking \"openness\" and some space. Don't know if it's the HD600s, the amp, or just the nature of headphones themselves, being placed in your head for example, I know their weight may be a factor, I don't know, just not feeling it.\n\n  \nHope any of you can relate and give me some advice, thank you all!",

In this review, I‚Äôll be speaking about the Kiwi Ears Ardor, a pair of Wireless Over Ear headphones with ANC capabilities and sold for a competitive listing price.\n\n>*Disclaimer: the Kiwi Ears Aventus were sent to me by Kiwi Ears so that I could write an honest review. This review represents my personal opinion on the set, it isn't promotional or paid content and I don‚Äôt get any revenue from the sales of this product.*  \n*At the time of the review, the Kiwi Ears Aventus were on sale for about $72.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4giq7q011yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee4768ab389034deee24688b0c66af6a709d16cd\n\n# Technical Specifications\n\n* Type of headphone ‚Üí Over-Ear\n* Driver Configuration ‚Üí Dual DD 40mm + 10mm coaxial\n* Bluetooth version ‚Üí 5.4, supporting SBC and AAC codecs (no AptX, no LDAC) +¬† low-latency mode\n* Bluetooth range ‚Üí 8-10m (free open environment)\n* ANC ‚Üí Hybrid ANC, noise reduction depth -32B¬±3dB\n* Battery capacity and declared battery life ‚Üí 1000mAh, for a total of about 18hrs with ANC+RGB ON, 45hrs with ANC ON and 82hrs with ANC OFF\n* Fast charging ‚Üí Yes, 10 mins of charge correspond to 4 hours of playback (with ANC OFF)\n* Frequency response ‚Üí 20Hz-40KHz\n* Impedance ‚Üí 16‚Ñ¶ ¬± 10% @ 1KHz\n* Sensitivity ‚Üí 102dB ¬± 3dB @ 1KHz 1mW\n* Weight ‚Üí 290g (measured on my own non-professional scale)\n* Charging port ‚Üí Type-C\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus come well packed and the box contains:\n\n* The Kiwi Ears Aventus\n* A Detachable Audio cable\n* A USB Type-C charging cable\n* A USB Type-C charging data cable\n* One pair of tuning foam pads\n* A User Manual\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pai8tu1211yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32969399057b4033a0436c5ea40f887de653a619\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wvslc2211yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9efb4d8248c5ec6bca280f13fac1bff2531f3a08\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ronqcdr311yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c12208d2b329ec81ee43216ecbae80d793fd5442\n\n# Design, Build Quality, Comfort and Isolation\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus look very ‚ÄúDJ‚Äù-ish, with a pretty thick junction between the earcups and the sliders and a large headband. The earcups themselves have RGB lighting that you can activate or keep OFF, and when the RGB lights are OFF the headphones just look like any other headphone. When turned ON, they give some sort of gaming vibes which is confusing since these are supposed to be sold to DJs so it doesn‚Äôt seem like the target is well-defined, at least if we speak about lighting only.¬†\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knkv19g411yf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a782c04a5cdf3988d4358633ff85fbc2be306cb3\n\nThe overall build quality is solid, the sliders look and feel sturdy, the earcups themselves have about 90¬∞C swivel on the back and and a couple degrees of swivel on the front as well to grant some headroom for proper fit and the overall softness of the pads and headband cushion is decent. The headphones are also foldable and this makes up for an easy-to-carry set, even though they sit quite awkwardly in the storage case.  The comfort itself is pretty good from my own experience, just be aware that the pleather pads could become pretty warm during summer or hot periods in general.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omubezl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10a9cf8e2c43f1a1950eb07df223cd4aed1cf480\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0ozhzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfcc854db3fd68d9f35ff467f2d33782027dd5bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8rgrzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826ba7f50c9920c089b54a0447621625ffde6a38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5ckyyl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=609c2127c547e2efb3f8dfc959c2c34f4c1fa761\n\nThe buttons on the earcups are responsive and they don‚Äôt cheap when clicked since there‚Äôs enough tension to them, even though the sound coming from them could have been a bit more muted in order to feel more ‚Äúpremium‚Äù (but that‚Äôs just a nitpick, nothing else).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/poj54dc711yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89863a313cd6087121e7fb116333aab9eb5c1eb9\n\n# Battery Life and Connectivity\n\nThe battery life is pretty good yet not the best you can find in this price range (especially considering that the Ardor exist) good, and although I didn‚Äôt have the chance to test the full 45¬† hours with ANC ON and RGB lighting OFF, I have done some testing and noted the remaining battery life after some listening.\n\nAfter 30 hours of listening with no charge between multiple sessions, the battery life displayed on my phone‚Äôs bluetooth settings for the Aventus was 29%, meaning that 71% of the battery was consumed in the first 30 hours of listening. Hypothesizing the same usage, which involved slightly different volume levels, ANC ON and RGB OFF and random calls here and there, we can assume that about 10 more hours of listening will consume the remaining battery life (more or less).\n\nSure, these aren‚Äôt objective measurements in optimal conditions (mixed usage, various volume levels, a couple calls here and there) but these are respectable numbers from my point of view.\n\nSomething that I cannot understand is the reason why a DJ would use these with bluetooth, since although these are shipped with a couple wires to use them wired, they are still promoted as DJ headphones, hence it‚Äôs pretty confusing that you have RGB lighting and bluetooth (I can understand ANC, instead, since it could help isolating from external noises during live sets).\n\nSo, you can use these wired connecting them to your amp or DJ console/controller, or you can use them in bluetooth mode: in this regard,I haven‚Äôt experienced any issues, disconnections or other types of problems related to pairing and/or connecting to the headphones, both in single point and multi-point mode. Just make sure you pair every single device singularly before using them in multi-point mode and you‚Äôll be fine.\n\n# ANC/Transparency feature, Latency and Commands\n\nThe ANC of the Kiwi Ears Aventus is okay, and even though you‚Äôre not getting Bose-like ANC you‚Äôre still getting some isolation that will avoid super high volumes just to get rid of the surrounding noises. The passive isolation is pretty good as well so those in combination do the job, especially considering Just like with the Ardor, I have noticed a weird behaviour of the ANC when I‚Äôm on the bus and the bus itself meets some street bumps along the way: in those cases, the ANC makes some annoying pops that I have already heard when using my KZ Carol TWS. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but it‚Äôs something worth mentioning.\n\nThe transparency feature works well, it doesn‚Äôt emphasize things too much making them almost ‚Äúartificial‚Äù and I think it‚Äôs definitely usable. I have used sets with a better transparency mode, but I think this is on-point and accomplishes the task pretty well.\n\nThe latency is there, I am not gonna lie, and even using the low-latency mode it still isn‚Äôt low enough to make hassle-free gaming possible: if you‚Äôre playing games and want a wireless set, I don‚Äôt think this is the right one, it‚Äôs just better to buy a headset with proprietary 2.4GHz dongle since universal bluetooth connectivity has its own limits (and these don‚Äôt even have AptX to compensate for them).\n\nThe commands are responsive and easy to understand, and haven‚Äôt encountered any issue in this regard.\n\n# Sound\n\n**GEAR USED FOR THE TEST**\n\n* Mobile phones: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Xiaomi Mi A3, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n* Laptop and Desktop PC with Bluetooth 5.1 USB adapter\n* Lenovo Chromebook Duet\n\n**Let‚Äôs talk about the sound**\n\nI will be talking about the Aventus with ANC ON and Music Mode ON.\n\nThe Aventus are mostly balanced with some added bass, a relaxed upper midrange and slightly boosted treble response (not fatiguing though). Depending on your head-size and on how they fit and clamp on your head, you‚Äôre going to have slight deviations from what I am saying and that is probably one of the weaknesses of this product. The main issue, in fact, is that very small positioning differences on my head lead to sound differences that I struggle to explain, so it was a very inconsistent experience in my case and a very hard product to review.¬†\n\nTo me, the Aventus are okay, with an overall balanced response that never gets overdone in a specific part of the response. The bass, for example, is not overcooked or muffled, nor is it too thick/overpowering, and it‚Äôs there in the right quantity with average speed. It‚Äôs not very textured yet not super fat to the point that you don‚Äôt hear any texture in it, if that makes sense.  \nThe lower midrange has some added warmth even though the midbass isn‚Äôt rich enough to empower the lower mids, so the lower mids are probably boosted by the tuner to warm things up a bit without the need of pushing the bass more than that. The upper mids, instead, aren‚Äôt fatiguing and they never become hot, and I‚Äôd say that they‚Äôre not as emphasized as on your average Harman-tuned headphone.  \nThe treble isn‚Äôt fatiguing but there‚Äôs some spice here and there to avoid darkness, even though the highs definitely feel like something is missing up top (some details and sparkle, for example). The mid-treble can get a bit peaky at times also and this makes some cymbals slightly unnatural or splashy and some ‚ÄúS‚Äù sounds a bit sharp occasionally.  \nUsing the spare foams included in the box can attenuate the treble even more, although I don‚Äôt really find these annoying.  \n  \nThe soundstage isn‚Äôt very spacious, but it‚Äôs okay for a closed back set, and the imaging is also okay overall. Nothing to write home about I‚Äôd say but no true bad words to spend here either.¬†\n\nTurning OFF the ANC gives the sound a warmer tint, the mid-treble emphasis is tamed a bit and the headphones become a touch more controlled and relaxed, even though they are still mildly V-shaped. The soundstage and imaging remain intact.\n\nClicking the ANC button twice activates the gaming mode, which kinda makes the bass tighter and gives a more V-shaped tinge to the sound with slightly tighter and less thick bass and more treble emphasis. I‚Äôd say it helps a bit with spatial cues in game even though a pair of KSC75 or similar stuff will still give you cleaner positional cues, period.\n\n**Microphone quality**\n\nThe microphone quality is passable, nothing that screams high quality but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs usable for calls and similar stuff. The noise cancellation is overall pretty strong, which is good news, although sometimes it cuts out some parts of my voice trying to eliminate the surrounding noises.  \nHere you have an example of the microphone quality:\n\n# Some comparisons:¬†\n\n**Kiwi Ears Ardor vs Kiwi Ears Aventus**\n\n>With ANC ON, both are tendentially bassy and warm-sounding with average technical performance. However, the Aventus goes for a warmer presentation up top, with less upper midrange and less low-end as well. The main issue, in my opinion, is that the response relies too much on the positioning of the headphones on the head, leading to an inconsistent listening experience that I found dealbreaking. The technical performance of the Aventus is also inferior compared to the Ardor and varies with positioning on the head. The Ardor sound less loud even at higher volumes compared to the Aventus. In terms of overall value, the Ardor are a lot more specific, they look and feel like a more well-thought product and target the average casual user who wants a portable, comfortable and bassy headphone for the day-to-day commuting, whereas the Aventus are still confusing to me: they have RGB to appeal gamers, the DJ design to appeal DJs, but they somehow have a sort of ‚Äúinconsistent‚Äù sound experience which is not ideal for DJs since they never stay in the same position when they‚Äôre performing (source: I used to DJ as well so I know what I am talking about). In addition, the Ardor has better battery life so it‚Äôs the smarter choice between the two if you don‚Äôt wanna charge it as frequently as you‚Äôd do with the Aventus (not that their battery life is bad but the Ardor have better battery life and that‚Äôs objective).  \nIn my opinion, the Ardor gives you something more for your money and it‚Äôs a sleeker and more comfortable set for everyday use. The Aventus are not ‚Äúbad‚Äù per se, but some quirks make them less recommendable than the similarly priced Ardor, which are a lot more consistent no matter how you wear them and truly feel like something that was designed a touch better.\n\n**Kiwi Ears Aventus vs Sony WH-1000XM5**\n\n>Very different price yet maybe someone could be curious to compare a couple different options. To me, both sound a touch unnatural, but there are a couple key differences.   \nThe XM5 sound more V-shaped with brighter treble and a lot more low-end (even too much at times). However, they almost sound the same everytime I wear them whereas the Aventus are kinda inconsistent so the perceived level of bass and treble kinda depends on the fit. In terms of overall technical performance, I think there aren‚Äôt big differences even though the XM5 sound sometimes more resolving due to the brighter treble (it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúperceived‚Äù clarity‚Äù up top but it doesn‚Äôt really translate into a better opinion from my side).  \nThe comfort is good on both sets but the WH-1000XM5 sit on my head way better and are more stable. In terms of passive isolation and ANC, the WH-1000XM5 easily takes the lead.  \nIn terms of overall customization through the app, bluetooth codecs and so on, the WH-1000XM5 easily win. However, I‚Äôd say the battery life of the Aventus is one of their strengths (even though you have to count the worse ANC and so on).  \nThe price is very different and although the sound signatures are different, the sum-up of this comparison is that spending more will give you a more refined and well-though product.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus aren't revolutionary nor do they set new standards. It's a set that has some fit issues that lead to an inconsistent sound, so everyone's experience may vary depending on the size of the head, on how the headphones are placed on the head, and it's probably the biggest fault of this product.  \nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus score a 3/5 from me, which may seem like a bad vote but that is a 6/10 that hopefully will convert into a better rank if they'll ever release a sequel with better overall consistency. The sound is pretty pleasant, the comfort is nice, the headphones are foldable and they should appeal to many users, but the target market itself is also confusing so it's another thing that makes them less \"specific\".  \nSome say \"Don't bite off more than you can chew\", and this is probably the way I'd like to end my review: I think Kiwi Ears is able to appeal most of the people out there but they should not do that with a single product. It's much better to carefully design a product targeted to very specific users rather than trying to make one that has to appeal many people without excelling in anything particular for those specific users.  \n  \nThanks Kiwi Ears for starting the journey in over-ear headphones, this is a welcomed choice and hopefully we'll see even more competition in the full-size cans' market space.  \n",

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

    "selftext": "This topic has been discussed by others here and elsewhere before, but I genuinely couldn't find a conclusive answer, so I'm asking here: how much power do T50s actually need?\n\n\n\nPeople seem to often conflate \"loud enough\" with \"getting powered properly\". Loudness is dependant on gain, i.e. Voltage, but that's literally only half the equation for power. As far as I understand it, the issue is that you obviously need current as well to move the driver, but also that impedance is dependant on frequency (due to inductance and capacitance of the headphone). So certain headphones might be loud enough at lower power, but actually have a changed frequency response.\n\n  \nTheory aside, I actually noticed this myself with my Dekoni Blue (factory modded T50RP MK3s). They had a noticeably better bass response on my topping NX1s (150 mW into 32Œ©) compared to my SMSL M3 (108mW into 32Œ©), even though these are both overspeced, when going by Headphone.com's power calculator (suggesting 3.98mW for 110dB). Obviously everyone agrees that that number is completely off, judging, by the T50s reputation for being hard to drive, but nobody ever explains why exactly that's the case, or how much power they actually require. Logically there would have to be a point where the frequency response stops changing, and I'd like to know where that point is.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has a better explanation for the physics of power requirements please also share. I think this topic is surrounded by so many half-truths, it's impossible to find good information. ",

    "selftext": "***TL;DR:*** *Yes, they're that good. For me they hit all the sweet spots with ideal compromises for the price/package. The best ANC/Wireless/BT headphone I have heard. I think they deserve the hype in their neutral / out-of-the-box EQ. They cherry pick lots of great qualities and bundle them into a class defining package. I am happy they hit the price point they do. They feel made with love and care for anyone that loves high quality sound. They're what I have been looking for and they deliver.*\n\nStuff I use as references / comparisons / competition:\n\n* Sennheiser ie900 + Qudelix 5K PEQ \n* Focal Clear OG + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Elegia\n* sennheiser HD650 + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Bathys + Android/Linux\n* Sony WH-1000XM5 + Android/Linux\n\nMusic I usually listen to:\n\n*   Mostly metal/rock/prog (Bleed from Within, Knocked Loose, Mars Volta, Mastodon, QOTSA, Deftones...)\n*   Classic rock (think Fleetwood Mac, Beetles,  and friends)\n*   Pop/Alt (Taylor Swift, Wolf Alice, Last Dinner Party, Manchester Orchestra, Portugal. The Man, ...)\n*   Hip hop, mostly 90s but also some newer stuff\n*    Jazz, but only on a Friday\n\n**Sound**\n\nThe important bit. All thoughts are based on the neutral, default EQ settings.\n\nI have different headphones for different things. I have my Focal Clears and ie900 for detail. I have my HD650 for cosy and relaxed listening.\n\nI have my Focal Bathys for times when I need to block the world out and enjoy music without disruption.\n\nI have my WH-1000XM5 for ... everything else. Seriously, I wear these 8 hours a day while working, doing the dishes, hoovering, gardening.\n\nThey're just great at being portable and disappearing on my head. They get out of the way and the sound is very unremarkable and never distracting.\n\nOh and the Elegia. They're terrible. We don't talk about those.\n\nNow imagine if somehow all those headphones were put in a blender and out poured the perfect mix of them all. All the compromises in the right places. The bad bits barely noticeable. The good bits there in enough measure to make the whole mix perfect.\n\nThat's the HDB630.\n\n* Just enough detail that I can listen to the detail without being waterboarded and fatigued by it.\n* Just enough warm buttery smooth mid-range without being muddy or overly warm.\n* Just enough treble sparkle without feeling ringy, metallic, or sharp.\n* Just enough bass without feeling swollen, thick, or intrusive.\n* Just enough width and imaging without feeling sparse or overwhelming.\n* Just enough physical lightness and clamping to be comfortable.\n* Just enough flattery of the recording without being cute.\n* Just enough ANC without ... well, the ANC could be better but nobody is beating Sony.\n* Just enough for serious listening without hogging your attention\n\nPoint is, it's enough of everything. In the right mix. It is just ... right. My Bathys will be going on ebay or something, and I can't see my XM5 getting much use anymore.\n\nThey're not \"impressive for a closed back\" or \"impressive for a wireless headphone\" or anything like that. They're \"impressive. Full stop. In all categories.\".\n\n**BT700 dongle + App**\n\nThis all seems OK. Not really played with it too much and don't feel the need. The dongle works fine and works on Linux so that's good.\n\nBT on Android was the usual. Seems stable.\n\n**Build quality**\n\nIt's enough. If not having metal hinges means they hit the price point, then good on them. I'd rather this level of sound\n\nwas accessible to as many people as possible. The chassis is good. Comfort is good. Not the best, but perfectly enough.",

It's a tool to create personalized EQ settings for your headphone on your head, and it's focused on convenience and usability.\n\nWe have now created a how-to video that shows how we (the creators) use the tool. The approach shown in the video is only one of multiple possible ways and there's more information in the Q&A section.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo)\n\nNote: You will need an EQ app like EqualizerAPO / Peace or EqMac to comfortably listen to music and other things on your system -- the Owliophile tool is only there to help you find the right settings.\n\nWe're planning to make more videos on the technical / theoretical background, as well as explaining all details of the tool, so if you're curious you are welcome to subscribe to the channel. Anyway, I hope this first one serves as a good and practical introduction to the topic of personalized equalization for some of you.\n\nCheers!  \nOwlio",

    "title": "Audeze LCD 2C - One Month Review",
    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

Loved how clear and Fun everything sounded to me and thus learned more about sound in general. Then I got some Kz iems, liked it and switch over to the Letshouer S12, but then my m4's broke. So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

Now, just disregard audio quality completely. I'm just talking noise cancelling with ANC. How is it that airpod pro 3s beat the xm5 in noise cancellation with ANC on? I mean thats what the graph shows - much higher attentuation dBs for the APP3s compared to the XM5s. They do fizzle out near the high pitched end but im guessing that overears even without ANC are better in blocking out high freq noise because of the build material and clamping over ears. Seems like ANC doesnt make much of a difference for XM5s anyways on the high end. So my question is that ive seen all over the internet that overears + anc are always better than wireless earbuds (air pods). Why is this case different? Or am i a total idiot and i dont understand the graphs or the context. ",

    "selftext": "I've never in my entire life, having visited more than 10 different audio shops around Asia, South East Asia, NA and Oceania-- have I ever encountered a store that makes me feel as unwelcome and as bothersome to the staff as I have in Addicted to Audio. \n\nI was greeted at the door, that's great. But upon sitting at demo area, having exchanged a few pleasantries with the staff, their attitude quickly changed. Asking them about anything would yield a response that came across unbothered or sometimes annoyed. Sometimes the staff outright ignored me, completely unbothered, clicking away on his phone/laptop when the room is completely silent and just the two of us, when I made a comment or asked a question. \n\nI've gotten responses like \"Huh? Oh. Yeah, ok.\", \"Pick something else then.\"\n\nIt's not even just what they say or don't say, but it's how they say it. They really made me feel like they didn't want my business. Oddly they would only ever respond if you asked about the price. For such a niche hobby for enthusiasts, the staff at Addicted to Audio seem incredibly uninterested in audio at all. \n\nThe audio hobby is already so niche, rarely ever coming by others who share the interest. I'd like to enter an enthusiast store and meet other enthusiasts who actually care and want to share their love of audio. \n\nIf the staff are so uninterested then they should just work at Harvey Norman or JB HiFi where customers actually don't want to engage the staff. \n\nI'm an experienced audiophile with a fairly deep appreciation and budget. I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment. The local audiophile circle feel the same way and have since chosen to bring their business to Minidisc instead. ",

    "title": "Lets talk about the new Edition XV",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/it1hxzzqlrxf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=5912a58e06d71ad339cda4f905209e4b1052edb0\n\nI compared a few headphones a couple of days ago, and a lot of people wanted to hear more about the Edition XV. So let‚Äôs talk about it.\n\nAmong all the headphones I‚Äôve listened to, the closest one might be the Fiio FT1 Pro. The moment I put the Edition XV on, I instantly felt this warmth spreading through me ‚Äî like being wrapped in honey. You‚Äôll know what I mean once you try it.\n\n**Bass (before & after eq using oratory 1990's, the EQ didn't change the conclusion below)**\n\nThe most distinctive thing about the Edition XV, to my ears, is its **meaty bass**. It‚Äôs thick, elastic, and feels like it‚Äôs hugging the sides of your ears. It‚Äôs not the fast, clean kind of bass you get from the HE600. It‚Äôs the wet, creamy kind ‚Äî like your ears are being gently massaged with a cloth soaked in oil.\n\nThe bass also has more layers than the FT1 Pro, but the FT1 Pro‚Äôs bass FEELS more aggressive. It‚Äôs like a scholar delivering an insult ‚Äî refined, yet every word cuts deep. There‚Äôs more nuance and subtlety here, unlike the FT1 Pro, which just lashes out bluntly. Naturally, this makes the Edition XV sound a bit less aggressive at first. But if you listen closely, the impact is still there ‚Äî it just feels smoother and more full-bodied.\n\nThat said, not everyone listens critically all the time. When I‚Äôm just relaxing, I sometimes *feel* like the FT1 Pro has more bass (even though that‚Äôs not actually true if you listen critically when A/B them). I just want to bring this up because sometimes people would only describe stuff in their critical listening sessions, but headphones could feel VERY¬† different in daily casual listening.\n\n**Mids**\n\nNow, the mids. Vocals on the Edition XV are closer and more intimate than typical Hifiman models like the Arya Stealth or Edition XS, but still a bit farther away than on the FT1 Pro. The voice is rich, full, and slightly nasal. For female vocals, the singer can sound about ten years older than she actually is. That‚Äôs not necessarily good or bad ‚Äî it‚Äôs all down to taste.\n\nThe vocals lean on the darker side. Compared to the FT1 Pro, they‚Äôre more refined but also smoother ‚Äî which means you lose some of that raw texture in the voice, like the growls in the rock music. Personally, I prefer the FT1 Pro‚Äôs vocal texture; it carries more emotion like anger or passion. The Arya Stealth also feels more emotional than the Edition XV, but for a different reason ‚Äî it has more treble, more air, and that shimmer in the highs makes the vocals feel alive and vibrant. (You know those highs that vibrate with your skulls?)\n\nStill, the Edition XV has its own charm. A lot of 80s and 90s tracks ‚Äî songs like city pop ‚Äî take on a totally different vibe here. In fact, I‚Äôd describe the Edition XV as a **vibe** in itself. You know those days when you‚Äôre tired of all the crap and just want to chill, wrapped in a soft blanket, hugging a pillow? That‚Äôs what the Edition XV feels like. It won‚Äôt shock you, it won‚Äôt thrill you ‚Äî it just gives you that warm, steady, safe harbor you want to come home to.\n\n**Treble**\n\nThe treble is soft ‚Äî no sibilance, no sting. The FT1 Pro is more exciting in this area, which is why I think it‚Äôs the better all-rounder. The Edition XV, though, owns its signature mood completely.\n\n**Others**\n\nAs for soundstage ‚Äî the Edition XV‚Äôs lateral stage is narrower than its front-to-back depth. Sometimes the sound on both sides feels smeared onto a flat plane beside your ears, kind of vibrating there, which feels a bit unnatural. The FT1 Pro‚Äôs stage is even smaller, but it doesn‚Äôt have that issue.\n\nOverall, the Edition XV definitely has better detail retrieval and imaging than the FT1 Pro.\n\n**I wouldn't use a \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this headphone, since it is so special in the Hifiman lineup that I don't think there is any other hifiman headphone that can be compared with it. It is its own vibe, and if you can vibe with it, then it can probably beat those far more expensive headphones for you. If you can't (for example, you really enjoy other Hifiman lineups), it's really hard to say if you would enjoy it as much as others do.**\n\nHere is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1odsod7/comparison_between_he600_edition_xv_edition_xs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from a couple of days ago if you want to know more about my preference in sounds.",

    "selftext": "\nThe Hifiman Arya stealth are absurdly good for the price I got them at. At just below 500 dollars it‚Äôs the Ultimate endgame headphone for me. \n\nThe comfort is very nice. The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it‚Äôs Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth‚Äôs do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it‚Äôs a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it‚Äôs very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn‚Äôt too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren‚Äôt for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can‚Äôt wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now. Maybe later in life I‚Äôll upgrade but I know diminishing returns hit really hard after this so it‚Äôs a matter until I have some cash ready to burn. \n\n\n\n",

Absolutely gorgeous in the mid range and with a little EQ (+3db at 100hz) the bass feels a bit more full. What floors me about the RS2x‚Äôs is how natural instruments sound with them. Jazz, rock‚Äîpretty much anything with actual instruments sounds incredible. Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can‚Äôt imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these. They‚Äôre far from neutral but if you like the way they color music Grados are some of the best cans.

Far more neutral, but man can they be EQed. No distortion with any level of reasonable EQ on the bass so if I want to put on some electronic music and blast some chunky thick bass directly into my brain, these are the cans to do it.

(Not that other music sounds /bad/ on them, it‚Äôs just not what they excel at.)\n\nNone of my friends are big into audio and they‚Äôve heard me rant about my cans probably more times they can count so I thought I‚Äôd dump my thoughts and adoration of my set up here. \n\nFeel free to share your desktop set up‚Äôs as well I‚Äôd love to see what other people are working with, gear-wise. \n",

Either it sounded dull, the UX was bad or I just plain didn't like using it.\n\nHaving tried mostly chinese stuff, I finally wanted to try something completly different and it paid off.\n\nMy recent purchase was the Lake People G101 a simple, anlog headphone amp. No balanced, no DSP, just a power putton, volume dial and headphone ports. I love it. This might sound silly, but I really enjoy having dedicated 3.5mm and 1/4inch ports so I never have to use an annoying adapter anymore.\n\nI rarely see products of this company anywhere online, so I wanted to share it with you all (although you might know them by their high-end brand \"Violectric\"). This costs 240‚Ç¨, is built like a tank and - something I also rarely see marketed about - is proud of the built-in headphone protection circuits. Let's hope I don't need them but it's nice to see thought given to that part of the device. Also designed and built in Germany for my fellow r/BuyFromEU volks.\n\nThe DAC on-top is a Topping D10s, one of the first HiFi products I got and it runs great too. What can I say: It's a DAC. Did an AB test with other DACs and couldn't tell a difference so they really don't matter in terms of sound (for me).\n\nIf I could change anything it would be the color of the DAC, both being black would be nice. But other than that I am so happy and juet feel peace with this setup. It sounds great, has lots of power and will hopefully last me a long time.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. After many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they‚Äôd be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. After about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. I love these headphones and all the things the 600 family can‚Äôt do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. Anyway, I have only really listened to the suede pads so far, but both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. The drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family, at least visually from the outside, but they focus on things like a fun but balanced tonal curve while providing a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the widest soundstage I‚Äôve heard from a Sennheiser, it‚Äôs not even close. That being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. As someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. Weirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop‚Ä¶ I know what you want me to say, but I don‚Äôt hate them. They‚Äôre definitely not the headphone I‚Äôm going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I‚Äôm hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes. I absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is nasty. I will be buying a new cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro‚Äôs are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you‚Äôve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I‚Äôd love to hear other‚Äôs perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I‚Äôll get.",

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I haven‚Äôt really seen much coverage of this product online, and I thought it deserves some more attention so I will try to share my thoughts.\n\nThis headphone is not available in many countries, but I was able to buy it from Aliexpress for around ¬£20($26) including postage. A retro-style lightweight Bluetooth openback headphones from Philips to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\n\nIn this product category, the closest competitor I could think of is Koss porta pro, Kph30i or the wireless koss porta pro all of which cost more than this product. I‚Äôve also compared it to some grados and my HD6XX and HD560s.\n\nGiven the price range, I was shocked at the tonal balance and the resolution. I would say Grado and Koss both have a very distinct texture of sound that makes it sound really cheap with little bass. In my ears, Ringo definitely has a more balanced V shape sound signature and has less of that cheap texture to the sound. Given my experience and preference, I would take this over Grado SR60/80i/e or Koss porta pro/kph30 any day for its timbre and tuning even if it was the same price point.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, the resolution or timbre isn‚Äôt gonna beat an HD6XX, and the build is quite cheap. But I find the build with its metal headband more sturdy than any of the Koss headphones that can even be triple the price. For a fun sounding Bluetooth headphones with 26 hour battery, lightweight and decent retro design AND built in app eq for around ¬£20 is crazy. \n\nI‚Äôve got too many headphones and have bought all the headphones mentioned in this review, but I will be keeping these around which is the biggest compliment I can give as I have given away/sold the all the Koss products. I‚Äôm no expert and have no intention to try over selling these but for anyone who‚Äôs considering a sub 100 open back Bluetooth headphones, these are the best in my experience!",

    "selftext": "So you decide to upgrade your audio setup with a nice pair of headphones. BuT WhAt PaIr Of HeAdPhOnEs? You ask. Well here it is a guide to headphone tuning.\n\nSo first off there needs to be a disclaimer being no matter what headphones you buy, they will not sound perfect to you. Sonic \"perfection\" is entirely unique to you with complex ideas like HRTF and more importantly how that noggin of yours processes sounds. To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

    "selftext": "So say I'm watching Netflix on my TV at night, and I'm listening on my headphones so as to not bother the neighbors.  The audio signal is going from a Firestick, to the TV, through an optical cable, across the room to an SMSL SU1 DAC, into a Douk U3 headphone amp, into a pair of Sennhieser 598's.\n\nThat's all well and good, except it requires a cable to be lying across the floor of my living room from my TV to the couch area.\n\nOne wireless alternatively obviously would be some kind of Bluetooth receiver, but I hear that results in decreased sound quality?\n\nIs there any other wireless way to transmit the signal across the room from my TV to my DAC?  Is this something that a Wiim can do, for example?",

Feet are cheapish metal \"isolation\" spikes. Those were the nicest looking solution for getting the necessary ventilation clearance between the two amps.\n\nThe DX5 II is a really neat little box full of features and with all the power I need. Moved the previous Topping E50/L50 stack to my study. No need for any other DAC/amps until something breaks.\n\nThe Antares is for my Stax and the hopefully soon repaired Sennheiser HE-60. More affordable than an equally powerful amp from Stax, and nice to have something hand-made in Germany, but it could really be a bit smaller.\n\nI got the Little Dot MK2 on a whim last year and very occasionally use it with my HD800. My impression is that it does something pleasing to the staging and shaves off most of the micro details, which can be relaxing depending on the mood and music. Despite recommendations it is  not good with the HD580 which, to me, already lacks resolution. Need to set up an A/B comparison one of these days to see if I am just imagining things. \n\nHeadphones are Stax Lambda Nova Basic, which I got for cheap with one of the utter crap Stay entry level amps.",

Personally, I‚Äôm not a believer in all that snake oil ‚Äî people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don‚Äôt buy it. And honestly, I don‚Äôt think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I‚Äôve always thought that if there‚Äôs any difference, it‚Äôs basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time ‚Äî I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a ‚Äúbigger soundstage,‚Äù I just assume it‚Äôs because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I‚Äôm open-minded ‚Äî I‚Äôll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that‚Äôs matched, everything else ‚Äî bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging ‚Äî sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I‚Äôm out. Either they‚Äôre trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don‚Äôt. In either case, their opinions don‚Äôt mean much to me anymore, because I can‚Äôt hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let‚Äôs talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn‚Äôt tell exactly what at first, but it didn‚Äôt feel like my imagination. After more testing ‚Äî switching headphones, replaying the same tracks ‚Äî I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head ‚Äî especially those higher notes ‚Äî in a way the K7 doesn‚Äôt. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that‚Äôs somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it‚Äôs like their voice locks into one spot ‚Äî more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this ‚Äî it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you ‚Äî same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat‚Äôs not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer‚Äôs right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste ‚Äî some benefit from that extra space, some don‚Äôt. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** ‚Äî *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn‚Äôt huge, but it‚Äôs there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It‚Äôs actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it‚Äôs slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less ‚Äúexciting.‚Äù The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah ‚Äî I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It‚Äôs pricey, and there‚Äôs no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat‚Äôs my honest take.",

    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n‚Üí Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n‚Üí Punchy bass.  \n‚Üí Delicious female vocals.  \n‚Üí Soundstage above average.  \n‚Üí No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n‚Üí DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n‚Üí If you are a purist, stay away.  \n‚Üí Mids somewhat soft.  \n‚Üí Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30‚Ç¨/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a ‚Äúmore and better.‚Äù\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:**¬†present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:**¬†this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:**¬†here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:**¬†somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:**¬†maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:**¬†with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:**¬†substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:**¬†too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:**¬†I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:**¬†at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:**¬†placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:**¬†keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:**¬†could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:**¬†testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko‚Äôs character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos‚Äô voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:**¬†testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once‚Ä¶ I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:**¬†dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:**¬†not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:**¬†paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:**¬†I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it‚Äôs unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you have fun‚Äù vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

However ALOT of problems have risen up Rn.\n\nThe audio sounds HORRIBLE! Its muffled, with me having to equalize the hell out of the headphone to sound the similar to my IEMs or the AKG K44. (I use the Onboard Motherboard sound card ‚Äúgigabyte P110-D3‚Äù for more info) \neven then it screws my video/audio editing precision up,(volume control, General Equalization etc.) making me double check my videos twice with my IEMs. \n\nWhen I equalize it, i balance the bass but still give the cheap feeling  of when you listen to something with a bit of Bassy, the high and mids just go ‚Äúlow volume‚Äù mode.

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

This makes me suspect that my iPhone 17 Pro might have a defect in its audio chip or a related component. When I played the same songs on my older iPhone 13 Pro using AAC, there was no distortion. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have a Lightning dongle, so I couldn‚Äôt test aptX on the older phone. And also I have dropout problem when using both dongle.Does anyone else with an iPhone 17 series notice these issues?\n\nMy personal experience with these three little friends:\n\nYou really can‚Äôt go wrong with either dongle.\n\nQCC Pro\n\nHas its own app with a much better UX design. The slim form factor fits perfectly on a phone or tablet. Looks more premium in person (the photos make it seem cheaper than it is). Comes with only one dongle ‚Äî I originally thought there were two (one for the phone and one for the headphones that communicate directly), which would‚Äôve justified the higher price over the BTD700. The packaging design is a bit misleading.\n\nBTD700\n\nWorks great for home or office use.Doesn‚Äôt have a mobile app, but there‚Äôs one for PC/Mac. Sadly, I couldn‚Äôt update the firmware no matter what system I used. But it works. One simple button does everything you need.\n\nIn terms of sound, they‚Äôre very similar. I can only tell the difference when comparing side by side ‚Äî the QCC Pro‚Äôs mids are slightly louder and more forward.\n\nIf you like the QCC Pro‚Äôs design but prefer the BTD700‚Äôs price, check out the QCC Standard (white) version. I believe only Bloom Audio carries it, and they‚Äôre an awesome retailer. Please remember, Only QCC PRO Has LDAC.\n\nAbout the PX8 S2\n\nThey‚Äôre extremely comfortable. My head circumference is about 21.5\", and I‚Äôm very sensitive ‚Äî even picky ‚Äî about anything pressing on my head (I can‚Äôt stand most beanies). But I can wear the PX8 S2 for long sessions with no problem. My old XM3s and AirPods Max felt like Jigsaw‚Äôs traps in comparison.\n\nThe leather is incredibly soft ‚Äî genuinely reminiscent of Herm√®s leather. If you or your HAPPY WIFE have Herm√®s bags, you‚Äôll know what I mean.\n\nAs for sound quality, the PX8 S2 really shines with large-scale or orchestral music. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not good for solo performances ‚Äî I love listening to Yo-Yo Ma with them. For pop music, it‚Äôs more about personal preference. The sound is very balanced ‚Äî I like it a lot, but as I like to say, I like drinking water‚Ä¶ and you might not.\n\n\\*I use gpt to make my post more readable and I also post this review on B&W subreddit. Any advice or question are welcome\n\n",

The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these.

I am getting into running and have tried out a few options like in-ear as well as over-ear headphones but they are very uncomfortable while running. I am now trying to get into bone conducting headphones since many models seem to be preferred by runners. Now comes my fear, is there any health risk associated with the vibrations caused by the headphones? \n\nI am very paranoid about brain/bone problems and am worried that this might be something the headphones could impact in the long run but I haven't seen many scientific papers about this. \n\nThe main focus is usually ear damage but I'm more so worried about the potential brain or bone damage it could cause.

    "title": "Advice for the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs 80ohm Headphones",
    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

This is usually resolved by installing the USB DAC driver provided by the maker, but [SMSL does not have such a driver for the R1](https://www.smsl-audio.com/portal/product/downlist/id/11.html).\n\nThe sound when the treble/bass sliders are set to flat and EQ is set to 1 (neutral) is decent, soundstage is wide and imaging is pleasing. I would say it sounds as good as any good dongle DAC out there. The volume dial stepping is digital, and its 0% volume rest position is around 8 o'clock but audio cannot be heard until the dial moves to just above 8 o'clock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unh2e5uyb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=543c5fadfb1cc44339cf3758d73cf601b3a33d75\n\nWhen all processing is flat/off there is no noticeable distortion even at high volume on both HE1000se and HD600. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih4wc1k5c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=729948d649f5ce4ddf421d1be1c21acebfcce333\n\nThe power output is 130mW so quite low, but it's capable of driving both headphones just fine and loud.\n\nWhen you enable any EQ or adjust the tone controls, distortion comes in at higher volumes especially noticed in songs with bass or audio with bass, so for gamers playing shooters, this is a big issue if you want to tone control or use one of the better EQ presets as flat is just that and lacks any smoothness/warmth in sound signature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j87meo97c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76683158a5dc1f033677e071151592f4e455520c\n\nUsing it is a DAC only and pre-amp using the RCA outputs to the power amp it does an OK job although there is noticeable noise floor interference that can be heard, just like what I found with the Creek 4040A a while back. Seems the analogue circuitry is not isolated.\n\nI then plugged in the RCA interconnect between the X9 and power amp to test and heard no noticeable interference noise. In this config the power amp was set to bypass and R1 used as pre-amp, in pure DAC mode and volume controlling via the power amp, the same noise can be heard once you increase the power amp's volume, the R1's volume is maxed out in this test to imitate bypass and be DAC only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r54td2q8c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3de0a8271051809a0c92c11c9a8c9092c9be0307\n\nIt is priced at $71 currently, I think if you must have a desktop sitting box to use and interact with then ok it's fine, but these caveats have to be considered. Otherwise I would say the ONIX Alpha XI1 offers better sound with none of the distortion issues or noise etc at a slightly higher price and offers more power, lower THD+N.\n\nThe other advantage of the R1 though is it has dedicated mic input, although if you are a gamer you almost certainly have a USB mic or headset anyway so this is not really a selling factor.\n\nThe volume dial is super slick though, there is that....\n\nI was unable to open up the housing properly for a teardown as even with all the screws out, I could not lift out the top panel with the sliders properly without fearing breaking something. Either it is glued on, or there is a method to it.",

No balanced, no DSP, just a power putton, volume dial and headphone ports. I love it. This might sound silly, but I really enjoy having dedicated 3.5mm and 1/4inch ports so I never have to use an annoying adapter anymore.\n\nI rarely see products of this company anywhere online, so I wanted to share it with you all (although you might know them by their high-end brand \"Violectric\"). This costs 240‚Ç¨, is built like a tank and - something I also rarely see marketed about - is proud of the built-in headphone protection circuits. Let's hope I don't need them but it's nice to see thought given to that part of the device. Also designed and built in Germany for my fellow r/BuyFromEU volks.\n\nThe DAC on-top is a Topping D10s, one of the first HiFi products I got and it runs great too. What can I say: It's a DAC. Did an AB test with other DACs and couldn't tell a difference so they really don't matter in terms of sound (for me).\n\nIf I could change anything it would be the color of the DAC, both being black would be nice. But other than that I am so happy and juet feel peace with this setup. It sounds great, has lots of power and will hopefully last me a long time.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. After many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they‚Äôd be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. After about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. I love these headphones and all the things the 600 family can‚Äôt do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. Anyway, I have only really listened to the suede pads so far, but both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. The drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family, at least visually from the outside, but they focus on things like a fun but balanced tonal curve while providing a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the widest soundstage I‚Äôve heard from a Sennheiser, it‚Äôs not even close. That being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. As someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. Weirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop‚Ä¶ I know what you want me to say, but I don‚Äôt hate them. They‚Äôre definitely not the headphone I‚Äôm going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I‚Äôm hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes. I absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is nasty. I will be buying a new cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro‚Äôs are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you‚Äôve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I‚Äôd love to hear other‚Äôs perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I‚Äôll get.",

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

    "title": "¬£20 Philips Ringo: best Bluetooth headphones sub ¬£100",
    "selftext": "Hello, I haven‚Äôt really seen much coverage of this product online, and I thought it deserves some more attention so I will try to share my thoughts.\n\nThis headphone is not available in many countries, but I was able to buy it from Aliexpress for around ¬£20($26) including postage. A retro-style lightweight Bluetooth openback headphones from Philips to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\n\nIn this product category, the closest competitor I could think of is Koss porta pro, Kph30i or the wireless koss porta pro all of which cost more than this product. I‚Äôve also compared it to some grados and my HD6XX and HD560s.\n\nGiven the price range, I was shocked at the tonal balance and the resolution. I would say Grado and Koss both have a very distinct texture of sound that makes it sound really cheap with little bass. In my ears, Ringo definitely has a more balanced V shape sound signature and has less of that cheap texture to the sound. Given my experience and preference, I would take this over Grado SR60/80i/e or Koss porta pro/kph30 any day for its timbre and tuning even if it was the same price point.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, the resolution or timbre isn‚Äôt gonna beat an HD6XX, and the build is quite cheap. But I find the build with its metal headband more sturdy than any of the Koss headphones that can even be triple the price. For a fun sounding Bluetooth headphones with 26 hour battery, lightweight and decent retro design AND built in app eq for around ¬£20 is crazy. \n\nI‚Äôve got too many headphones and have bought all the headphones mentioned in this review, but I will be keeping these around which is the biggest compliment I can give as I have given away/sold the all the Koss products. I‚Äôm no expert and have no intention to try over selling these but for anyone who‚Äôs considering a sub 100 open back Bluetooth headphones, these are the best in my experience!",

    "selftext": "Just wanted to see if anyone here can fact-check me on this. I am an Android Apple Music user, and I've been looking to switch over to Qobuz to get the full Lossless experience. I was checking on the difference in sound quality through speaker between the services (just out of curiosity), and I can swear the Qobuz version sounds *a lot* better.\n\nBelieving I'm being tricked by placebo, I put my Sennheiser Momentum 4s, which I know cannot stream lossless, just to see if I was being tricked by placebo if I heard the same difference. But in my headphones, *the difference is bigger*. I hear the mix much more spacious and clear, with more detailed highs and WAY better separation. Am I just dumb and I'm being tricked by something else?\n\nP.S.: I should add, I do not have the USB passthrough thing yet to overcome de 48 khz resampling in Android, since I haven't switched entirely to Qobuz. Still, that wouldn't make a difference given that this is with a wireless headset.",

    "selftext": "So you decide to upgrade your audio setup with a nice pair of headphones. BuT WhAt PaIr Of HeAdPhOnEs? You ask. Well here it is a guide to headphone tuning.\n\nSo first off there needs to be a disclaimer being no matter what headphones you buy, they will not sound perfect to you. Sonic \"perfection\" is entirely unique to you with complex ideas like HRTF and more importantly how that noggin of yours processes sounds. To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

It delivers dynamic, crystal-clear audio with a wide soundstage and stunning detail. Paired with the Arya Organic, it's a near-perfect match for me, of course, within this price range.\n\nHowever, when it comes to vocals, film scores, classic rock, or pop, the DX5 II can feel a bit too clinical,,almost overly precise. That‚Äôs exactly why I decided to try the K13, hoping for a warmer, more organic presentation thanks to the R2R DAC.\n\nA/B testing starts today, and I‚Äôll share a more detailed review over the weekend.

    "selftext": "This week i received the DAC AMP SMSL DL200. I'm really enjoying the sound of this device, but now I'm trying an A/B Test from both outputs 6.35mm single-ended (with 3.5mm adapter) and 4.4mm \"balanced\", using the Fiio FT1 Pro. I'm not sure if is placebo, but I think I hear a better sound with the 6.35mm.\n\nI was checking ASR forum and i see the SMSL DL200 don't have a truly balanced output for the 4.4mm output, is \"pseudo-balanced\" so in theory both outputs have the same power, but I want to understand technically, why the single-ended output, in my ears, have a better sound than the pseudo-balanced 4.4mm output?",

    "title": "How to 'Jailbreak' SteamDeck, or alter (or find workarounds for) Gaming Mode control scheme?",
    "selftext": "Hello there, tl;dr at the end of the post, but a bit of backstory to start.\n\nAbout a month ago I bought a Lenovo Legion Go S (with SteamOS), as at the time it was much easier to get hold of than an actual Steam Deck, and even though I would have preferred a Steam Deck, so far I've loved it. There are a few things which annoy me, like navigating Desktop Mode using the touchscreen or joystick-as-mouse, or the weirdness of navigating Gaming Mode in general, but it's mostly fine.\n\nAnyway, it was my younger brother's birthday this past weekend, and since he loves paradox and city building games, last week I decided to order him the 1TB OLED Steam Deck. There were a few delivery issues, but it arrived yesterday, and both my brother and I were pretty excited to start using it. After the experience of helping him set it up though, I have to say I'm kind of disappointed.\n\nThe OLED screen quality is amazing, I love all the different input options available, and navigating Desktop Mode is much nicer than the Lenovo with the trackpads and all that.\n\nBut what infuriates me is Gaming Mode, which is just a misery to use. Why did they make it so you can't change the control scheme at all, so there's no way for you to alter things such that you don't have to hold down the steam button to use the right trackpad as a mouse? Why can't you use the left trackpad to scroll, something you inevitably have to do lots of if you're trying to navigate the home store page, or your library, or the steam workshop? They let you use the cursor & middle-wheel scroll functions of an external mouse connected via bluetooth or usb, so why not just allow the trackpads as well?\n\nOf course, all this just means that the experience of navigating Gaming Mode on the Steam Deck is identical to the experience I had with the Lenovo Legion Go S (though the Steam Deck also tends to be a bit more dysfunctional in terms of the system hanging and games crashing for some reason), so you might ask why I'm complaining. Well, my brother sort of crystallised my thoughts on the issue last night when we were talking about it. He said that the Steam Deck was so close to being an ideal experience in so many ways, but there was always some sort of small issue that popped up and created unnecessary friction which stopped it from being so. That awareness that the experience could be so much better if things were tweaked just a little bit is intensely frustrating.\n\nOf course, none of this would be an issue if it were possible to run things in Desktop Mode all the time, but I've read in several places that if you want to maximise performance, you sort of *have* to run games in Gaming Mode due to some optimisations Valve have implemented plus the GameScope wrapper. Well, that plus the fact that the in-game Steam Overlay in Desktop Mode is absolutely awful, and if the game doesn't make use of the trackpads for their mouse functions, then you can't use them in the Steam Overlay either (if the game is windowed and you use the touchscreen to click outside the window & defocus from the game window, then you can use the trackpads, but why not just make it so switching to the in-game Steam Overlay enables the use of the trackpad mice by default?). Also, I've heard Desktop Mode limits the amount of CPU threads your games can make use of, but I'm not sure how true that is.\n\n(tl;dr, actual question starts here)\n\nWhich leads me to the question I put in this post's title: is there any way, via 'Jailbreaking' or otherwise, it would be possible for me remove the block Valve put on Gaming Mode making use of the left & right trackpads as a scroll wheel & mouse cursor respectively? Since they let you use external mouse input in Gaming Mode, maybe some way to make Steam think the trackpads are an external input source or something? Or maybe it might be possible at least to remap one of the back L4/R4 L5/R5 buttons into a toggle for the 'steam button is being held down' input?\n\nAnd if not, is there a way I can get the Desktop Mode to have similar performance to Gaming Mode so my brother and I don't have to use it?",

I went through every monthly chart Valve has released (August 2022 - present) and gave each rank a point value. The number one game is worth ten points, two is nine, three is eight, etc. I added them up and sorted them by year as well as a total for all years. It is kind of interesting to see which games have been consistent and which have not. For those who do not want to click the link I'll share the top 10 here.  \n\n  \n1. Stardew Valley  \n\n2. Elden Ring  \n\n3. Baldur's Gate 3  \n\n4. Vampire Survivors  \n\n5. Balatro  \n\n6. Cyberpunk 2077  \n\n7. Red Dead Redemption 2  \n\n8. Grand Theft Auto V  \n\n9. Hogwarts Legacy  \n\n10.

You can use Waydroid to simulate an android device (if you have not already) and download/update Minecraft there. Run it from Waydroid (works in Game Mode & Desktop Mode) and it will be on the newest update. I‚Äôm able to access realms, servers, and the marketplace just fine. \n\nHOWEVER my own solo worlds are nowhere to be seen. You probably just have to transfer the world file over for the time being.\n\n2) The unfortunate latter is just running the dated but compatible version for your solo worlds. Not the best thing to hear but it does still work for the time being. Just no online features whatsoever. ",

I've tried the solutions to these other issues and I still have the same problem. If there is already a post on other solutions to this, please let me know and direct me to that post.\n\nOccasionally (very often but not all the time) when I wake my steam deck from sleep, the wifi is not connected. If I try to go in and manually connect to a network, it shows no available networks.\n\nIt is not limited to just one network. It happens at work and at home. As I said above, I've tried solutions like toggling the developer mode wifi power management. Same issues happen whether it's toggles on or off.\n\nI recently went to the system update channel and change it to beta. The issue still happens. \n\nThe only solution to get my networks back on is to reset my steam deck. When I reset the deck, everything is normal and working fine. Until the next time I put it to sleep. It's hit or miss. It doesn't happen every time.\n\nI feel like it's most common when it's asleep for a longer period of time (close to an hour) or when I'm switching between networks. I use our company wifi inside the building, but when I go outside, I'll switch to my phones hot spot. The issue is most common at work. When I get back home I'll turn it on (today for example) and the network is unavailable. When I'm home and on my home wifi, I don't notice the problem as much, but that may have to do with the fact that it doesnt sleep as long as it does between breaks at work etc. ",

It just doesn‚Äôt feel smooth at all, the smoothness seems completely random depending on where I‚Äôm looking in the game. Sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm playing at 90 FPS, and other times it drops to around 30.\n\nWhen I stream using the desktop app, everything works perfectly, not a single lag, super smooth gameplay, streaming at 1440p 90 Hz.\n\nMy PC is powerful (7800X3D, 9070XT), and my internet connection (I‚Äôm not playing locally) is 1 Gbps on both sides. On my Steam Deck OLED the Wi-Fi speed is around 600 Mbps. So yeah, I‚Äôm pretty sure the issue comes from the MoonDeck plugin for some reason.\n\nI‚Äôve tested a ton of resolutions (Deck native, 1080p, 1440p, 4K) and different bandwidth settings, but the results are totally inconsistent.\n\nIs anyone else having the exact same issue?\nAgain, the desktop app is super smooth and the image quality is amazing.\n\nI really like the MoonDeck plugin, playing through the desktop app is annoying since I have to switch controller configurations every time.",

It's in the living room hooked up to the TV and I've been using a controller. I used to have my PC at a desk but now I work at a job where I'm at a desk all day so that's the last thing I want to do. \n\nRecently I got a PS5 in preparation for GTA 6 coming to consoles first. As I was messing around with it I thought \" why have a PC now?\" My PC is pretty powerful but I'm not a huge nut for max performance and fidelity anymore. Since I'm already playing games mostly on the couch with a controller, why not just get rid of the PC and keep the PS5?\n\nI will still have access to my steam library through the steam deck which I use quite often. Any games that are more demanding I can use the PS5 for. \n\nIf I need a computer for anything other than gaming, I can use the steam deck. I currently have it hooked up to a dock on a desk to monitors like a computer anyway. I also have a pretty cheap laptop just in case. \n\nI'm trying to think of any reasons to keep the PC but I can't given my scenario. Thoughts?",

Since I'm already playing games mostly on the couch with a controller, why not just get rid of the PC and keep the PS5?\n\nI will still have access to my steam library through the steam deck which I use quite often. Any games that are more demanding I can use the PS5 for. \n\nIf I need a computer for anything other than gaming, I can use the steam deck. I currently have it hooked up to a dock on a desk to monitors like a computer anyway. I also have a pretty cheap laptop just in case. \n\nI'm trying to think of any reasons to keep the PC but I can't given my scenario. Thoughts?",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI recently found out about those commercial ‚Äúsecurity fog‚Äù systems shops use ‚Äî the ones that instantly fill a room with thick but harmless fog so it‚Äôs harder for someone to see/grab stuff. The concept is perfect for what I want, but the real units I‚Äôve found are $$$ (I keep seeing $2‚Äì3k+), which is way out of my range.\n\nI‚Äôm trying to do a budget/DIY version for a small apartment/home setup.\n\n**What I‚Äôm trying to do:**\n\n* I already have a SimpliSafe alarm system.\n* SimpliSafe only talks to SimpliSafe gear, so I was thinking of using a side channel (like having it text/call a number I control) and then having a Raspberry Pi / Arduino listen for that and fire a relay.\n* When it fires, I want:\n   1. A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that‚Äôs actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won‚Äôt wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20‚Äì30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** ‚Äì Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the ‚Äúsafe default‚Äù for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** ‚Äì Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that‚Äôs meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** ‚Äì Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** ‚Äì if anyone has done the ‚Äúalarm ‚Üí webhook/SMS ‚Üí Pi ‚Üí relay ‚Üí device‚Äù pattern, I‚Äôd love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it‚Äôs just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = ‚Äúleave now.‚Äù\n\nIf this isn‚Äôt allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

Not to mention the glare from the sun in the summer months. My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter.

How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option.

Meaning I can send a signal to _something_ to turn on when music starts playing.\n\nI suspect that something can be some sort of a 220v plug that connects an extension with multiple sockets where all the gear is plugged in. \n\nThat something must have some sort of way to turn on/off programatically and must be overriden physically. For example for streaming I want it to turn on automatically but when I want to spin some vinyl records, I want to turn it on physically. I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home.

The issue I am seeing with this is that the this will only work as long as my phone is within range of the lighbulbs. I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.\n\nEdit: turning the lights to a set timer as opposed to sunrise/sunset seemed to fix the issue. Had my phone on airplane mode during when the lights were supposed to turn on and they did. ",

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n¬†\n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n¬†\n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n¬†\n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered).¬†\n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n¬†\n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Tr√•dfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n¬†\n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

I set up a home assistant server a few years ago but couldn't quite justify keeping it in place as I didn't have the need at the time.

During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5).

The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

I'm considering buying one secondhand, anyone got one handy and wants to sell at a reasonable price?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, we are working on something and I'd like to know your honest opinion, sort of a sense-check.\n\nIt's a tool (or rather a suite of tools) that guides you step by step through the process of building and maintaining a smart home. A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe‚Äôre still in development and not selling anything yet ‚Äî just trying to see if there‚Äôs real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob ü§∑\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

The concept is perfect for what I want, but the real units I‚Äôve found are $$$ (I keep seeing $2‚Äì3k+), which is way out of my range.\n\nI‚Äôm trying to do a budget/DIY version for a small apartment/home setup.\n\n**What I‚Äôm trying to do:**\n\n* I already have a SimpliSafe alarm system.\n* SimpliSafe only talks to SimpliSafe gear, so I was thinking of using a side channel (like having it text/call a number I control) and then having a Raspberry Pi / Arduino listen for that and fire a relay.\n* When it fires, I want:\n   1. A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that‚Äôs actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won‚Äôt wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20‚Äì30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** ‚Äì Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the ‚Äúsafe default‚Äù for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** ‚Äì Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that‚Äôs meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** ‚Äì Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** ‚Äì if anyone has done the ‚Äúalarm ‚Üí webhook/SMS ‚Üí Pi ‚Üí relay ‚Üí device‚Äù pattern, I‚Äôd love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it‚Äôs just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = ‚Äúleave now.‚Äù\n\nIf this isn‚Äôt allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I have moved into a house with 12 massive skylights in the kitchen extension which look beautiful and im loathed to cover them at all but as I am so overlooked by the neighbours to the left and also at night, any light from the kitchen travels all through the house, keeping everyone awake. Not to mention the glare from the sun in the summer months. My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter. So just want to make sure im not going to be left with a permanent install i will hate. Please advise.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dik98j6336yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd4bbf8867ff80c1d200863bd763861ea8117c60\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efo49k2636yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d1adf32542880f2121f73e03474a770ecb68305\n\n",

I checked and the Vaillant is 2 wired.\n\nI guess i need to replace both of them with smart thermostat but in other rooms i have radiators where I want to add smart valves.\n\nCan I turn my radiators on and off seperately if the smart thermostat upstairs is for example on 20¬∞c and i want another room 25¬∞c?\n\nCan i just replace the Vaillant downstairs? Remove the one upstairs and just use the smart valves on the radiators, or do i need to replace the one upstairs also?\n\nAny recommendations what and how to do? Any recommendations on products to use?\n\nSorry for the newb questions.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n¬†\n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n¬†\n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n¬†\n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered).¬†\n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n¬†\n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Tr√•dfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n¬†\n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4).

Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2).

The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

    "selftext": "When I saw the news about the AWS outage, my first thought was: ‚ÄúUh oh, that‚Äôs going to break half the internet again‚Äù....\n\nSure enough, our colleague chat group exploded ‚Äî people started sharing stories of their home security systems collapsing: ‚ÄúMy Ring Cam won‚Äôt load,‚Äù ‚ÄúMy Blink camera just shows blank,‚Äù ‚ÄúMy smart lock app says server error and won‚Äôt unlock remotely\"... Hey? Ridiculous, right? Luckily my own smart locks were fine, and I haven‚Äôt installed any cloud-based camera systems at home yet, so I dodged that one.\n\nMeanwhile, I noticed that my company‚Äôs devices (cameras and the smart lock) just‚Ä¶ worked. I didn‚Äôt even notice anything was wrong. Unlocking, fingerprint, logs... all handled locally. No cloud delay, no ‚Äúserver error,‚Äù nothing. (Not naming brands or models here, don‚Äôt want it to sound like an ad.)\n\nIt actually made me realize how invisible reliability feels.... you don‚Äôt notice it until everyone else loses it. No strong opinions here, just sharing a small takeaway: local-first might not sound sexy, but when half the web goes dark, it suddenly feels very smart.\n\nAnyone else got hit by the AWS outage?",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI recently found out about those commercial ‚Äúsecurity fog‚Äù systems shops use ‚Äî the ones that instantly fill a room with thick but harmless fog so it‚Äôs harder for someone to see/grab stuff. The concept is perfect for what I want, but the real units I‚Äôve found are $$$ (I keep seeing $2‚Äì3k+), which is way out of my range.\n\nI‚Äôm trying to do a budget/DIY version for a small apartment/home setup.\n\n**What I‚Äôm trying to do:**\n\n* I already have a SimpliSafe alarm system.\n* SimpliSafe only talks to SimpliSafe gear, so I was thinking of using a side channel (like having it text/call a number I control) and then having a Raspberry Pi / Arduino listen for that and fire a relay.\n* When it fires, I want:\n   1. A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that‚Äôs actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won‚Äôt wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20‚Äì30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** ‚Äì Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the ‚Äúsafe default‚Äù for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** ‚Äì Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that‚Äôs meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** ‚Äì Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** ‚Äì if anyone has done the ‚Äúalarm ‚Üí webhook/SMS ‚Üí Pi ‚Üí relay ‚Üí device‚Äù pattern, I‚Äôd love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it‚Äôs just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = ‚Äúleave now.‚Äù\n\nIf this isn‚Äôt allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I have moved into a house with 12 massive skylights in the kitchen extension which look beautiful and im loathed to cover them at all but as I am so overlooked by the neighbours to the left and also at night, any light from the kitchen travels all through the house, keeping everyone awake. Not to mention the glare from the sun in the summer months. My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter. So just want to make sure im not going to be left with a permanent install i will hate.

The goal is this:\n\nMy boss wants to have an intercom that can connect to three different offices within the same building (~40-50 ft in distance from eachother). We purchased a wuloo intercom but he does not like having to remember the channels for each office. Ideally, this intercom system will have just a single button where he can press and instantly connect to any of the offices individually. It needs to be wireless and battery operated. TIA!",

Meaning I can send a signal to _something_ to turn on when music starts playing.\n\nI suspect that something can be some sort of a 220v plug that connects an extension with multiple sockets where all the gear is plugged in. \n\nThat something must have some sort of way to turn on/off programatically and must be overriden physically. For example for streaming I want it to turn on automatically but when I want to spin some vinyl records, I want to turn it on physically. I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home. Rpi cannot be hidden well due to fairly weak wifi reception\n\nThanks guys! ",

I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess. \n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nIm Erik aka Selfmadestrom from the Bluetti community. Im working since month on the wish that people want to use Bluetti devices in their Smart Homes.\n\nFinally we can entry the last milestone on this journey. Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don‚Äôt support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "title": "Wi-Fi convenience vs. Zigbee/Z-Wave reliability? Kinda 2025 smart lock dilemma lol",
    "selftext": "So I‚Äôve been deep in the smart lock rabbit hole lately and, man‚Ä¶ there are way too many options out there. Every brand swears theirs is ‚ÄúTHE SMARTEST‚Äù... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren‚Äôt essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it‚Äôs like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world‚Äôs ‚Äúsmart homes‚Äù catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you‚Äôre running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit ‚Äúnerd level 3000‚Äù... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone‚Äôs found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I‚Äôm cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn‚Äôt depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

(Preferably I can get them on amazon de)\n\nBasically, I want a simple, renter-friendly setup that lets me control and customize lighting around the apartment without touching any wiring, that I can latter move them to other place and that they are scalable and what I mean by that is that I can latter expand my smarthome and connect other stuff to it\n\nAny advice or personal experience would be super helpful!\n\nThanks in advance ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone !\n\nThis is my beginning in the world of smart homes. I‚Äôm not a complete noob as I‚Äôm pretty tech savvy, but here, I‚Äôm really stumped.\n\n  \nI bought a Tuya keybox (this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref\\_=pe\\_111711481\\_1111265561\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref_=pe_111711481_1111265561_i_fed_asin_title&th=1) ) for a really simple use case : I want to put my keys inside and be able to open it remotely if someone needs them.\n\n  \nI could give them a code that I set beforehand of course, but it might happen that they need to get in when I‚Äôm not here and I didn‚Äôt plan for them to come.\n\n  \nI naively thought the keybox would connect to wifi, but it‚Äôs only bluetooth and so I bought a tuya gateway too, the specific model that was advertised to be compatible with the keybox, this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref\\_=pe\\_109071451\\_1103836691\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref_=pe_109071451_1103836691_i_fed_asin_title)\n\n  \nIt was a NIGHTMARE to set up, because you actually have to NOT follow the instructions on the manual but instead look at the amazon page where it tells you the correct way to connect, but I managed to do it.\n\n  \nNow, I got my Tuya app with my keybox and my gateway. Great. But I still can‚Äôt connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I‚Äôve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn‚Äôt change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically‚Ä¶ but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn‚Äôt detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I‚Äôm missing ? A secret step ?",

I cut out one use and have moved to rechargeable, mostly, but at this point I think I‚Äôm ready to just go wired where I can.

I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can‚Äôt set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can‚Äôt set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I‚Äôm not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don‚Äôt have info on any wired then I‚Äôll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while.

I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed ‚Äì Entry ‚Äì Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there.

    "selftext": "I have a very simple heater my garage with an old-school thermostat.  I need to integrate this and have a Zooz Zen16 \"dry contact\" Multirelay to use but am unclear on how to actually wire the heater into this.  I have separate power inputs into the unit which is solved but I have 2 wires from the unit which don't make sense to me on how to connect them.  I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?  I can do all of the other bits but translating from these 2 wires to something else seems to be breaking my brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrjye1zgvxf1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=72379c7a66a60690a24cd86633780ac3f8fb97d8\n\n",

    "selftext": "3200sqft home, 2 story and single zone. Bedroom is on upper floor, living area is downstairs. Thermostat is on the bottom floor. No filters or humidifiers or anything else in the system. We currently have a gen 1 nest, which they just dropped support for and no longer works with the app. We are in the Apple ecosystem. The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit? Looking at the ecobee and the nest, but not sure if either one will give us an advantage with our current setup.\n\nThoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said ‚Äúno‚Äù and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

    "title": "How best to install a Reolink WiFi Doorbell using a 240V supply?",
    "selftext": "Hi, I need some advice please.  I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nAs winter is quickly moving in, we‚Äôre struggling to find a heater that actually keeps our shed warm without destroying our electric bill.\n\nWe‚Äôve tried a Pro Breeze mini heater (500W) - it did the job okay for a few weeks when it wasn‚Äôt too cold, but now it barely makes a difference.\n\nWe switched to a Dreo smart electric heater (1500W) which works great for heat, but it absolutely drains electricity.\n\nThe heater needs to be on from around 4PM to 10AM, and we‚Äôve got them both set up on Tapo smart plugs so they turn on/off automatically on schedule.\n\nThe ideal temp needs to stay between 15C and 24C.\n\nThe shed is insulated to a degree, but clearly not enough for the small heater to handle the cold now.\n\nAny recommendations for an efficient heater that can keep a small/medium shed warm without guzzling power?\nBonus points if it‚Äôs something we can still use with a smart plug or thermostat.\n\nThanks in advance. Any suggestions (or even setup tips) would be massively appreciated!",

Not after battery changes, just randomly. Over time one of my indoor sensors has become completely undetectable.\n\nI'm looking to upgrade but honestly I'm not very impressed with my Grovee experience. Maybe I just bought the wrong model? There seem to be so many different options of Grovee set ups, some of which have been talked about here but I'm afraid of a repeat performance from a new Grovee set up. Is there a better option out there? What have you been using and for how long?\n\nMy Desires:\n\n- Amazon Alexa (I would like to be able to link to Alexa so I can ask temp/humidity of certain sensors)\n- Android Widget Option\n- Less than $200 for set up (5 sensors preferred)",

Thank you all so much, I really appreciate this community so much. \n\n\n\nHi all, thank you in advance for any insight you can provide.\n\n**Prior to our issues:** we have a Google Home and multiple brands/types of smart devices. All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nIm Erik aka Selfmadestrom from the Bluetti community. Im working since month on the wish that people want to use Bluetti devices in their Smart Homes.\n\nFinally we can entry the last milestone on this journey. Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don‚Äôt support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "So I‚Äôve been deep in the smart lock rabbit hole lately and, man‚Ä¶ there are way too many options out there. Every brand swears theirs is ‚ÄúTHE SMARTEST‚Äù... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren‚Äôt essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it‚Äôs like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world‚Äôs ‚Äúsmart homes‚Äù catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you‚Äôre running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit ‚Äúnerd level 3000‚Äù... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone‚Äôs found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I‚Äôm cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn‚Äôt depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

    "selftext": "Hello Redditors. I just ordered some zigbee motorized blinds (Biltek) that come with a hub and remotes. What I am not really clear on is if the hub is all I require to be able to control these blinds and communicate with an app or will I also need to get a whole house hub??\n\nI just built my house so I have added a bunch of different smart tech - locks, heating system, garage doors are Wi-Fi, now blinds and I‚Äôve got some Eufy cameras to install. It‚Äôs starting to be a lot of different apps so it might be worth it to get something to tie it all together. If that‚Äôs even possible- I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôm willing to bet that someone on here will know!!\n\nTIA!",

I‚Äôm not a complete noob as I‚Äôm pretty tech savvy, but here, I‚Äôm really stumped.\n\n  \nI bought a Tuya keybox (this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref\\_=pe\\_111711481\\_1111265561\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref_=pe_111711481_1111265561_i_fed_asin_title&th=1) ) for a really simple use case : I want to put my keys inside and be able to open it remotely if someone needs them.\n\n  \nI could give them a code that I set beforehand of course, but it might happen that they need to get in when I‚Äôm not here and I didn‚Äôt plan for them to come.\n\n  \nI naively thought the keybox would connect to wifi, but it‚Äôs only bluetooth and so I bought a tuya gateway too, the specific model that was advertised to be compatible with the keybox, this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref\\_=pe\\_109071451\\_1103836691\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref_=pe_109071451_1103836691_i_fed_asin_title)\n\n  \nIt was a NIGHTMARE to set up, because you actually have to NOT follow the instructions on the manual but instead look at the amazon page where it tells you the correct way to connect, but I managed to do it.\n\n  \nNow, I got my Tuya app with my keybox and my gateway. Great. But I still can‚Äôt connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I‚Äôve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn‚Äôt change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically‚Ä¶ but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn‚Äôt detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I‚Äôm missing ? A secret step ?",

I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated.

    "title": "Bluetti is finally getting a official Smart Home Integration!",
    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nIm Erik aka Selfmadestrom from the Bluetti community. Im working since month on the wish that people want to use Bluetti devices in their Smart Homes.\n\nFinally we can entry the last milestone on this journey. Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don‚Äôt support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

Every brand swears theirs is ‚ÄúTHE SMARTEST‚Äù... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren‚Äôt essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it‚Äôs like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world‚Äôs ‚Äúsmart homes‚Äù catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you‚Äôre running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit ‚Äúnerd level 3000‚Äù... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone‚Äôs found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I‚Äôm cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn‚Äôt depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

She ran out to do some errands while I was home and the thermostat switched over into \"away\" mode even though I was standing in front of it.\n\nIt's been years, but I seem to remember my 2nd gen Nest being much better at recognizing home/away (without geofencing) and has me thinking of swapping the Ecobee out.\n\nI'm pretty knew to home assistant but I feel like I could set up automations that would do a better job of recognizing home/away status with the T6 than how the Ecobee has performed so far. Am I missing something or not having a setting turned on/off?",

I‚Äôve got the basics covered so far: a dishwasher, robot vacuum for cleaning, AC and central ventilation, a smart lock and cameras for security, plus whole-house lighting control and electric curtains.\n\nNow I‚Äôm thinking of adding something a bit different next, maybe for the shower room or the room that opens onto the balcony. I‚Äôve been looking at a window cleaning robot that seems great for those big balcony windows. It needs to be placed on the window manually, but once it‚Äôs on, it can clean automatically. I guess it might also work for shower glass.\n\nI‚Äôm also thinking about trying a sunrise light on the balcony that syncs with my main lighting setup. Has anyone tried either of these? I‚Äôm leaning toward winbot for the window cleaning, but I haven‚Äôt found a sunrise light that fits into my google home setup yet.\n\nIf you‚Äôve tried any uncommon or creative smart home gadgets, I‚Äôd love to hear what worked for you. Thanks!",

My home network has a VLAN for IoT devices so switches would be restricted to that.\n\nExamples of my use case scenarios would be\n- turning on the garage lights when the kitchen door is opened, either via a door sensor or motion sensor (and turning them off after a period of time) \n- turning on/off ceiling fans based on temperature \n- controlling lights and fans with verbal commands\n- running scenes for movie night to control ceiling and accent lighting\n\nIs there any real benefit to using a Lutron Caseta system in this case, or are wifi switches just as good?

The shortcut to Fortnite also looks suspicious ‚Äî instead of showing the normal file path, it shows something like:\n\ncom.epicgames.launcher://apps/... ‚Äî so it looks more like a link than a real shortcut to an executable file.\n\nIf anyone‚Äôs had a similar issue or knows what else I could try, I‚Äôd appreciate any advice.

These crashes always happen at most half an hour into the game, but sometimes as little as 30 seconds into it. I've taken it to two repair shops, one of which couldn't replicate the issue, the other replicated *an* issue, but not the *same* issue.\n\nThe second shop ran RAM and GPU memory tests. The RAM passed with flying colours, whereas the GPU had some issues. Because of this I upgraded the GPU to a Gigabyte RTX 5070Ti but it hasn't helped. (the SSD has also recently been upgraded so that isn't the problem either as it was crashing before and after the upgrade)\n\nI have two MSI monitors. One 4K, one HD. Thinking these may be the issue, I tried one at a time and the issue persisted.\n\nThe only other peripherals I have are one RODE mic, one logi webcam, a razer keyboard (which was bought recently and after the first crash), and a Logitech mouse.\n\nAny help at all would be extremely appreciated as I'm really struggling to know what to do next.

    "selftext": "My PC was originally installed 6 years ago with 2 SATA SSD drives (Samsung EVO 860 1TB). One of those drives had Windows installed and the other was just for storage.\n\nYesterday Windows was unable to boot when I turned on my computer (it was stuck on the Asrock logo of my motherboard). I unplugged all unnecessary peripherals and reset CMOS. I thought it was a problem with the bootloader but I couldn't fix it with a USB windows boot drive. I also updated the BIOS and tried it with a different SATA cable and different SATA ports.\n\nI ended up re-installing a clean version of windows on a new NVME drive and my computer boots up fine now. One of my SATA drives works fine as a storage drive but the one with the original Windows installation is still problematic.\n\nWhen I connect it still causes the boot up to hang on the Asrock logo. When I disconnect it everything works fine again booting up from my new NVME drive. \n\nThe thing is my BIOS can still recognize the make and model of the problematic drive. But if I hot-plug it after booting up Windows or try to connect it with an SATA enclosure, it doesn't show up, not in disk management or anything. I also tried to format/clear it with Gparted but Gparted doesn't recognize it either.\n\nIs the drive just fried/dead? Or is it somehow recoverable? I don't mind if Iose all the data on it because everything was backed up. Would just enjoy having that additional SSD.\n\nAny thoughts or ideas appreciated.\n\nUsing Windows 11, Asrock X570 taichi. 2x Samsung EVO 860 1TB Sata drives. NVME drive is a Samsung EVO 990.

This action is fraudulent, and if the lock is removed, the thieves can wipe the phone and resell it.

Looking at the CPU temperature with Core Temp, I haven't seen it go over 50 celsius.\n\nOn the list of things I've checked are\n\n\\- Windows memory diagnosic which returned no issues\n\n\\- DISM which seemed to have found some issues as it took about an hour to finish and got stuck at 62.3% for a while\n\n\\- Ran a battery report with powercfg which looked normal\n\n\\- Updated all my drivers using WinZip Driver Updater\n\nFinally, I tried to use Memtest86 to see if there were memory issues that windows memory diagnostic didn't find and it won't even load, it immediately says fatal error: failed to measure CPU cycle counter frequency. So, is the CPU just completely failing? It seems strange that I can still boot into Windows like normal and it will work for any time at all if that's the case.\n\nAlso, here are the dump files from the BSODs:  \n[https://www.mediafire.com/file/467z6s3c157d693/minidumps.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/467z6s3c157d693/minidumps.zip/file)",

So ive been trying to install the system anew with a USB stick. The first problem was the installation on my SSD. It said that the Installation cannot install the operating system on my ssd (error selecting partition for installation). After formatting, deleting the partition and refreshing it, it worked. The installation then always failed at 77% saying there was an error with installing win 11. So i tried again multiple times until my PC said it needed to be fixed and it started auto repair which then always keeps failing. I then started to boot from the USB stick again and restarted the installation which then went to 15% and the pc tried to restart. When it did it got stuck on repairing itself again and i had to start all over again. So im asking for help before i do anything else.  My Motherboard is an Asus B650",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nA while ago I dropped my phone while biking... I know, bad idea! Sadly my phone fell and got under my wheel. The whole screen got torn off. Now the phone is still able to start, but I can't unlock the phone to access the files when I connect it to my PC.\n\nSo I found a possible solution, but that needs some external hardware. People told me I could use a USB OTG Adapter. Now I think I need one with USB-C to connect my phone (S23) and that has HDMI and 2 USB-A out ports.\n\nI found something like this: [UGREEN Revodok USB C Hub PD100W, 4K HDMI, 3\\*USB A datapoorten USB C Dock Multiport Adapter Compatibel met iPhone 15, Galaxy S24, Surface, MacBook Pro/Air, iPad Pro/Air, Steam Deck etc. : Amazon.nl: Elektronica](https://www.amazon.nl/UGREEN-Revodok-datapoorten-Multiport-Compatibel/dp/B0BR3M8XHK/ref=pd_vtp_h_pd_vtp_h_d_sccl_2/261-4809086-6069313?pd_rd_w=nZL4G&content-id=amzn1.sym.aefedd1b-0e5a-4214-9873-4ce8cafdc55a&pf_rd_p=aefedd1b-0e5a-4214-9873-4ce8cafdc55a&pf_rd_r=BAB5W619T0RP1WRVRSFC&pd_rd_wg=Q7Uvw&pd_rd_r=532263a8-742a-4be6-bb4b-6e998f1817f2&pd_rd_i=B0BR3M8XHK&th=1)\n\nWould this be sufficient to connect my phone to a monitor (HDMI) and connect a mouse and keyboard (2x USB-A). Since I won't be using this adapter for anything else, I don't want to buy the wrong hardware here.\n\nWould love to know if this would work.",

Thinking it to be a driver issue (I have a 7700XT), I went to open Adrenaline but the shortcut says it can‚Äôt find the application with it also not showing up in search. Basically right after that the screen starts cutting in and out to black, and I hit shut down the moment I can see where to click.\n\nI‚Äôve had the card maybe 6 months (second hand), and I‚Äôve DDU‚Äôd the drivers both when I installed it and when I was having some green screen issues on RDR2 a few months ago - but no other issues at all until today. There‚Äôs a repair shop in my town but the guy is booked until the end of next week, but ideally it‚Äôs something I can fix myself? If not, I‚Äôd like to know what the consensus is before I make it worse somehow.\n\nThanks!",

The moment we connected the Ethernet and loaded into the game, no rubberbanding. Everything worked like a dream. Even just navigating around seemed to be faster. They told me it has to be my router/modem ISP.\n\nWent home, set my ATT BGW320 into IP passthrough and connected my personal router and hardwired to my pc. Still rubberbanding.\n\nIm at a complete loss\n\nI‚Äôve turned off all firewall settings on the ATT router, disabled packet filters and anything else that could be bottlenecking it. When I play over WiFi, my games are unplayable, but it does seem to get better over Ethernet. Nothing is working. Still rubberbanding and seeing the packet loss icon in every game.\n\nAlso want to mention, when I run speed tests, download speed is 1000mps and upload is the same. \n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that this only happens on my pc. All of our tvs are streaming over WiFi with no issues. I‚Äôm also able to play the same game over WiFi on my Xbox with no issues. ",

    "selftext": "I have had these problems for about a year now. My laptop never turns on right on the first try. It either goes into the BSOD or just freezes on the loading screen and stays that way. I then have to manually turn it off by holding the power button, and try turning it on again. This sends me to the \"Automatic Repair\" screen from where i usually try to diagnose the PC but it never finds a problem. I then either hit \"Restart\" or \"Continue to Windows 11\". After that it works normally. \n\nAlso, whenever I leave the laptop and it goes into Sleep Mode, if I leave it like that for too long i just turns off, my mouse doesn't work, the keyboard lights up, but nothing I do wakes it up. I plug it in and out, plug the mouse in and out, try to open task manager but nothing. Only holding the power button to shut it off, and turning it on again works.\n\n\n\nThings I have tried:\n\n\\- reinstalling Windows 11 (Initially the problem was on Windows 10, so i figured when i switch to Windows 11 it would fix the issues, but it didn't and even reinstalling Windows 11 didn't help)\n\n\\- running these commands: chkdsk /f, sfc/scanfnow, DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth\n\n\\- Error messages I have received: SYSTEM\\_THREAD\\_EXCEPTION\\_NOT\\_HANDLED most commonly and IRQL\\_NOT\\_LESS\\_THAN\\_OR\\_EQUAL, but there have also been others (though much less frequently)\n\n\\- updating drivers, but every important one is up to date\n\n\\- diagnosing my RAM because some people online suggested that the physical RAM was damaged, but I couldn't find anything wrong\n\n\\- probably 5 other things, but I can't remember anymore\n\n\n\nPlease help, the problem is annoying to deal with, but not important enough for me to send my laptop to a repair shop for 5 days. I would also like to rule out hardware issues. Thank you in advance.",

    "title": "Random GPU Crashes (VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE & DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION) ‚Äî Is my unit faulty or is it just the drivers?",
    "selftext": "Hello guys, I hope you‚Äôre all having a great day.  \nI have a problem with my GPU. About a month ago, I bought a laptop that performs very well in every task. However, recently I‚Äôve been having some troubles with it ‚Äî it crashes randomly. So far, it has happened 3 times in total.\n\nI‚Äôll try to give every detail I can, so I‚Äôm sorry if some of them are not related to the issue, and thank you for your patience.\n\nWhen I first got my brand-new laptop (it was FreeDOS), I installed Windows 11 right away. The first installation went a bit problematic ‚Äî something felt off, but I used it like that for about two weeks before deciding to reinstall Windows.\n\nBefore reinstalling, I prepared everything: I burned the ISO to a USB stick, entered the BIOS, made some tweaks to install it properly, switched to Turbo mode, and set it to use only the dGPU.  \nThis time, the installation went smoothly. After setting up Windows, I installed all of my drivers, and everything seemed fine at first.\n\nBut one day, my PC randomly crashed. I wasn‚Äôt doing anything heavy ‚Äî just a few Chrome tabs and some apps like Apple Music (I don‚Äôt remember all of them). After rebooting, I checked the Event Viewer and saw that a dump file had been saved. I analyzed it using WinDbg, and after checking online and asking ChatGPT for help, I found that the error was¬†**VIDEO\\_TDR\\_FAILURE (116)**.\n\nThe conclusion was that it was likely caused by the GPU driver, so I reinstalled the driver through the Nvidia app. Everything was fine for about 8 days, but then it happened again ‚Äî this time when I switched from Chrome to Minecraft (it was already running in the background). Suddenly, my screen went black, and the PC rebooted again.  \nI analyzed the new dump file, and it showed the same error.\n\nAfter doing more research, I decided to completely uninstall and reinstall my GPU driver using¬†**DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller)**.  \nI downloaded the portable version from its official site, booted into Safe Mode, ran DDU, and removed everything related to the GPU. Then, I rebooted into normal mode ‚Äî Windows automatically installed a driver and the Nvidia Control Panel.\n\nAfter that, I installed the Nvidia App, logged in, and noticed there was a new update available for the GPU, so I updated it. I also checked Windows Update to make sure everything was fully up to date. Then, I shut down my PC, waited for a minute, and booted it back up.\n\nEverything seemed fine for about five days. But then, after waking it up from sleep mode, it crashed again ‚Äî and this time the error was¬†**DPC\\_WATCHDOG\\_VIOLATION (133)**.\n\nLong story short, it‚Äôs been roughly 3 weeks since the fresh Windows installation. In those 3 weeks, I‚Äôve experienced 3 crashes of 2 different types. I wasn‚Äôt getting any crashes before reinstalling Windows, so I‚Äôm really wondering what could be causing this. Could Nvidia have published a faulty driver update? Should I try reinstalling an older version again to see if that helps?\n\nAt this point, I‚Äôm out of ideas. I‚Äôm not doing anything wrong or unusual, just normal daily use.  \nWhen I asked ChatGPT if I might have received a defective unit, it said the problem is most likely related to faulty GPU drivers, not the hardware itself.\n\nSo, I wanted to ask here to be sure ‚Äî does this sound like a¬†**driver-level issue**, or could it indicate a¬†**faulty GPU/laptop unit**? What should I do to fix this problem once and for all? Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n(By the way, I have to mention that the last dump file that saved is showing this message when I tried to open directly:\n\n‚Äú102825-19171-01.dmp ‚Äî You don‚Äôt have permission to open this file.\n\nContact the file owner or an administrator to obtain permission.‚Äù\n\nThe first two didn‚Äôt show any message like that, only the last one required administrator mode to open. I‚Äôm not sure if that detail helps or not.)\n\nLaptop specs:\n\nProcessor (CPU): AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX3D\n\nGraphics Card (GPU): NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Laptop\n\nMemory (RAM): DDR5 64 GB\n\nStorage: NVMe M.2 2 TB SSD GEN5\n\nFirst crash analysis - 101525-18453-01:  \n[https://www.mediafire.com/file/vfzezfqzlc240al/First+crash+analysis+-+101525-18453-01.txt/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/vfzezfqzlc240al/First+crash+analysis+-+101525-18453-01.txt/file)\n\nSecond crash analysis - 102325-18750-01:  \n[https://www.mediafire.com/file/edv7m1i9twep10i/Second+crash+analysis+-+102325-18750-01.txt/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/edv7m1i9twep10i/Second+crash+analysis+-+102325-18750-01.txt/file)\n\nThird crash analysis - 102825-19171-01:  \n[https://www.mediafire.com/file/30q173yfojkejaa/Third+crash+analysis+-+102825-19171-01.txt/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/30q173yfojkejaa/Third+crash+analysis+-+102825-19171-01.txt/file)\n\n(I‚Äôm not sharing actual dump files, only text outputs from WinDbg analysis.

I use an ATEM Mini Pro ISO with HDMI inputs so everything is hardwired. Yesterday I was trying to use a couple phones as cameras and here at the office it simply worked but when we went to the site where the event was being held (which has terrible service and the wifi has terrible range) the hdmi phone adapters refused to work. I did everything I could think of, restarting the phones, going into dev mode settings to change the usb type, etc etc. Just wouldn't work.\n\n  \nThen this morning out of curiosity at the office with all the same hardware... everything just works.\n\n  \nSo I am assuming that the phones need some reception or internet to do whatever before it allows the adapter to be used? I know on iPhones at least it will download the firmware, however all these adapters have been plugged into all the phones I have tried before and have worked. So even with previously used adapters, do the phones still need a signal in order for these adapters to work?",

    "selftext": "BLUF:  Need advice on how to sync specific calendar (individual ones) appointments between my personal & work email accounts.  The way I used to do it randomly stopped working in recent months.  I'm not sure if a setting on my iPhone got boogered up or something on my corporate Outlook changed but when I send appointments to myself it won't show up on my work email. I also tested sending one from my work to personal email and that works fine... \n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating how I used to do this, but I noticed recently that when I share calendar appointments with my work email (Office 365 account) from my personal iCloud/iPhone, they aren't forwarded to my company Outlook account.  I add my work email address as an invitee, but it never receives/displays the appointment.   Historically I used to do this a while back so not sure why it's not working.\n\nStrangely, if I invite a personal outlook account (like my wife's Hotmail), this works fine and she gets the invite.  I'm sure there are differences in the backend between a corporate office 365 account and personal outlook, but I find it strange it's not even displaying the invite.  \n\nI receive plenty of images, emails, etc from my personal accounts all the time so I know it's not a matter of it being blocked. \n\nNote:  I don't put personal details, medical information, etc in the calendar items.  For example, if it's a doctor's appt, it will say \"Med Appt\" and I generally will put the address.  If I ever developed a specialty thing where the address might over-share something I wouldn't put that in there but overall, this works for things I need to block out on my calendar, which can get complicated some weeks.",

    "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôve run into a pretty strange situation with my Lenovo Legion 5 Pro, and I‚Äôd appreciate any insights from the community.\n\nLast year, my laptop‚Äôs display suddenly went blank while I was using it ‚Äî the screen turned off, and the laptop would also power off by itself. I took it to a technician, and I was told that my GPU is gone so my laptop is dead now. Then i went to another renowned technician in my couuntry as there are no lenovo service centers over here thus i had to find the best technician possible and he said there was a fault with the RAM chip, which he repaired. He also mentioned that there might be a display-related issue on the motherboard and I have to change the LCD panel. But i didnt opt for it. \n\nAfter that, I started using a second monitor (external display) for months. Since my GPU wasn‚Äôt working, I uninstalled the GPU driver from Device Manager and used the laptop through CPU graphics only. It worked fine that way for quite a while.\n\nThen, a few days ago, something unbelievable happened ‚Äî my laptop‚Äôs built-in display suddenly came back to life, and the GPU started working again too. Even the fans kicked in properly, and everything seems normal now. It‚Äôs been three to four days, and it‚Äôs still running perfectly fine on the internal screen.\n\nThe only issues I‚Äôm facing now are:\n\nNo internal sound output\n\nOne key on the keyboard isn‚Äôt working\n\n\nOtherwise, everything‚Äôs smooth. Interestingly, the same thing happened about a month ago, but that time the display turned off again the very same day. This time, it‚Äôs stable for days.\n\nI‚Äôm just curious ‚Äî what could have caused this sudden recovery?\nCould it have been:\n\nA loose or corroded display cable (eDP) that somehow reconnected?\n\nA GPU solder joint temporarily reconnecting?\n\nOr some kind of BIOS/firmware self-repair or driver auto-reinitialization by Windows or Lenovo Vantage?\n\n\nAny technical insight or similar experiences would be great to hear.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I've taken it to two repair shops, one of which couldn't replicate the issue, the other replicated *an* issue, but not the *same* issue.\n\nThe second shop ran RAM and GPU memory tests. The RAM passed with flying colours, whereas the GPU had some issues. Because of this I upgraded the GPU to a Gigabyte RTX 5070Ti but it hasn't helped.

    "selftext": "My PC was originally installed 6 years ago with 2 SATA SSD drives (Samsung EVO 860 1TB). One of those drives had Windows installed and the other was just for storage.\n\nYesterday Windows was unable to boot when I turned on my computer (it was stuck on the Asrock logo of my motherboard). I unplugged all unnecessary peripherals and reset CMOS. I thought it was a problem with the bootloader but I couldn't fix it with a USB windows boot drive. I also updated the BIOS and tried it with a different SATA cable and different SATA ports.\n\nI ended up re-installing a clean version of windows on a new NVME drive and my computer boots up fine now. One of my SATA drives works fine as a storage drive but the one with the original Windows installation is still problematic.\n\nWhen I connect it still causes the boot up to hang on the Asrock logo. When I disconnect it everything works fine again booting up from my new NVME drive. \n\nThe thing is my BIOS can still recognize the make and model of the problematic drive. But if I hot-plug it after booting up Windows or try to connect it with an SATA enclosure, it doesn't show up, not in disk management or anything. I also tried to format/clear it with Gparted but Gparted doesn't recognize it either.\n\nIs the drive just fried/dead? Or is it somehow recoverable? I don't mind if Iose all the data on it because everything was backed up. Would just enjoy having that additional SSD.\n\nAny thoughts or ideas appreciated.\n\nUsing Windows 11, Asrock X570 taichi. 2x Samsung EVO 860 1TB Sata drives. NVME drive is a Samsung EVO 990.

While I was just watching a movie on my laptop, it suddenly restarted on its own and directly entered the BIOS menu. Since then, it hasn‚Äôt been able to boot into Windows.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed so far:\n\nMy SSD (Micron_2450_MTFDKBA1T0TFK, NVMe 1TB) is detected under the Storage section in BIOS.\n\nHowever, it does not appear under Boot Priority or the Boot Option Priorities list.\n\nIn the SATA Information section, the SSD is not visible (it‚Äôs an NVMe drive, not SATA).\n\nSecure Boot is currently disabled, and Fast Boot is enabled.\n\nBIOS Version: 327 (Version 2.20.0049, AMI 2023)\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 6800H with Radeon Graphics\n\nGPU: NVIDIA RTX 3050 Laptop GPU\n\n\nThis issue appeared abruptly ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt make any BIOS changes. The only recent change was a Windows Update earlier today, so I‚Äôm wondering if it might be related to that.\n\n\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar or knows how to fix this?\nAny advice on how to get my system to detect the SSD as a bootable device again or recover the Windows bootloader would be really helpful.\n\nI have checked the physical connection of the SSD and it seems good to me",

These crashes always happen at most half an hour into the game, but sometimes as little as 30 seconds into it. I've taken it to two repair shops, one of which couldn't replicate the issue, the other replicated *an* issue, but not the *same* issue.\n\nThe second shop ran RAM and GPU memory tests. The RAM passed with flying colours, whereas the GPU had some issues. Because of this I upgraded the GPU to a Gigabyte RTX 5070Ti but it hasn't helped. (the SSD has also recently been upgraded so that isn't the problem either as it was crashing before and after the upgrade)\n\nI have two MSI monitors. One 4K, one HD. Thinking these may be the issue, I tried one at a time and the issue persisted.\n\nThe only other peripherals I have are one RODE mic, one logi webcam, a razer keyboard (which was bought recently and after the first crash), and a Logitech mouse.\n\nAny help at all would be extremely appreciated as I'm really struggling to know what to do next.

I also updated the BIOS and tried it with a different SATA cable and different SATA ports.\n\nI ended up re-installing a clean version of windows on a new NVME drive and my computer boots up fine now. One of my SATA drives works fine as a storage drive but the one with the original Windows installation is still problematic.\n\nWhen I connect it still causes the boot up to hang on the Asrock logo. When I disconnect it everything works fine again booting up from my new NVME drive. \n\nThe thing is my BIOS can still recognize the make and model of the problematic drive. But if I hot-plug it after booting up Windows or try to connect it with an SATA enclosure, it doesn't show up, not in disk management or anything. I also tried to format/clear it with Gparted but Gparted doesn't recognize it either.\n\nIs the drive just fried/dead? Or is it somehow recoverable?
