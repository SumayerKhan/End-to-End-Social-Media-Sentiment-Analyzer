    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "title": "iPhone & Wi-Fi 7",
    "selftext": "> For those unaware, Apple claims that the iPhone 16 and 17 series support 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), but in practice this is **highly limited** compared with the full standard.  \n>  \n> **Wi-Fi 7’s most important technical features include:**  \n>  \n> • **Up to 240 MHz channel width on the 5 GHz band**  \n> • **Up to 320 MHz channel width on the 6 GHz band**  \n> • **4096-QAM modulation**  \n> • **MLMR MLO (Multi-Link Multi-Radio)** capable of aggregating multiple Wi-Fi bands into one high-throughput pipeline  \n>  \n> While Apple meets the *minimum certification requirement* (MLSR MLO), it disables nearly all optional features that make Wi-Fi 7 truly high-performance. As a result, **iPhone 16 and 17 models perform at speeds comparable to Wi-Fi 6/6E**, while other flagship phones achieve **3–4× higher throughput** using the optional features Apple ignored for two generations.  \n>  \n> For context, Wi-Fi 6/6E tops out at **160 MHz-wide channels**, **1024-QAM modulation**, and only one Wi-Fi band at a time — yielding peak theoretical speeds around **2402 Mbps**.  \n>  \n> Wi-Fi 7, when fully implemented, doubles channel width to 320 MHz, quadruples QAM density to 4096, and enables **true multi-band operation via MLO**, dramatically increasing real-world throughput.  \n>  \n> Apple’s iPhones, however, still restrict channels to 160 MHz, leave QAM at 1024, and only use MLO as a basic failover mechanism — effectively **Wi-Fi 6/6E with rudimentary band steering**.  \n>  \n> Some argue that wider channels, higher QAM, or MLMR MLO would drain battery. While Apple may have designed these limits intentionally, other flagship phones fully enable these features **without widespread battery complaints**, showing it’s a feasible design choice.  \n>  \n> Others claim that 5 GHz doesn’t support 240 MHz channels — but in regions like the **United States**, access points can operate at 240 MHz on 5 GHz, and Apple’s iPhones simply don’t take advantage of it.  \n>  \n> Apple’s documentation confirms that the Broadcom chip in the iPhone 16 series and the N1 chip in the iPhone 17 series are **capped to a single 160 MHz band**. Meanwhile, users have observed the performance discrepancy across multiple forums and reviews:  \n>  \n> • [Jason Deegan review](https://jasondeegan.com/iphone-16-review-disappointment-with-wifi-7-performance/)  \n> • [Apple forum complaints](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255812908?sortBy=rank)  \n> • [MacRumors forum complaints](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-buy-wifi7-router.2438418/)  \n> • [Apple's official tech specs of 16 & 17 series](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/wi-fi-ethernet-specifications-apple-devices-dep268652e6c/web)  \n> • [TP-Link Community complaints](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/705570)  \n> • [YouTube comparison of the 16 series](https://youtu.be/07FRuS67iD8)  \n> • [YouTube comparison of the 17 series](https://youtu.be/VtimPHdiv7U)  \n> • [YouTube warning not to buy Wi-Fi 7 routers](https://youtube.com/shorts/Pc3dAEoPPFo)  \n> • [MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/apple-n1-chip-has-wi-fi-7-limitation/)  \n> • [5GStore analysis](https://5gstore.com/blog/2025/09/16/apple-n1-chip-wifi-7-iphone-17/#what-wccftech-found-apples-n-1-chip-its-limitation)  \n> • [PhoneArena article](https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-16-pro-models-prevented-from-reaching-full-wi-fi-7-potential_id163151)  \n> • [iThinkDiff article](https://www.ithinkdiff.com/apple-n1-chip-iphone-17-wifi-7-limit/)  \n> • [iPhoneWired article](https://iphonewired.com/news/857921/)  \n>  \n> In conclusion, many users invest in premium iPhones and Wi-Fi 7 equipment expecting the full benefits of the standard. Apple’s current implementation delivers **minimal improvement over Wi-Fi 6/6E**.  \n>  \n> **If you’d like to see full Wi-Fi 7 features enabled on Apple devices, submit feedback via Safari:**  \n\n1. Type *AppleFeedback://* in the address bar and press Enter  \n2. Press **New Feedback**  \n3. Tap **iOS & iPadOS**  \n4. Enter *iPhone Wi-Fi 7 features* as the title  \n5.

    "title": "The iPhone Upgrade Program is absolutely NOT compatible with AppleCare One",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR: DO NOT try and add your iPhone Upgrade Program iPhone to AppleCare One, unless you want significant problems down the road.**\n\nI added my 16 Pro to AppleCare One in July, a few days after the program started. The support specialist read me boilerplate along the lines of \"In order to remain enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program, you must immediately add your phone to AppleCare One to ensure no gap in coverage\". I did that, got a gift card back for \\~$120, and felt happy with myself.\n\nI successfully used the program to get a 17 Pro a few weeks ago, which I picked up in store. However, when I came to return the 16 Pro, the phone was marked as \"Enrolled in iPhone Upgrade Program\", but the option to close the loan was greyed out with \"loan details not found\". The store associates, up to and including supervisors were very confused by this and hadn't seen it before.\n\nAfter approximately **11 hours** on the phone with Citizens, and Apple Support, speaking with about 15 different people, all of whom were very friendly, but none of whom had any idea what had happened, and **3 visits** to the store, I was eventually advised to return the phone as a standalone trade-in, and receive a store gift card. I then had to call a special escalated support number and have them cancel the gift card and close the loan. (It still ended with a 4¢ balance, which I then had to pay Citizens by credit card 😅)\n\nI eventually had final confirmation from that escalated support line that, despite what AppleCare specialists tell you, and despite the boilerplate coverage language, cancelling the Theft and Loss protection to put your phone into AppleCare One **immediately** cancels the Upgrade Program eligibility. Obviously some systems are aware of this (allowing me to upgrade to 17 Pro), and some are not (preventing me from returning 16 Pro).\n\nI asked about the 17 Pro and confirmed that it too had been removed from the program. They advised me to do a Closed Box return in store and then immediately re-buy the same phone through the program to get it back into eligibility. I tried this, and while I passed the credit check and managed to keep my same phone, Verizon refused to activate the line (presumably because it was already connected - to me). As a result, I couldn't complete the transaction, and ended up having to re-buy my phone outright.\n\nTo Apple's credit, they recognized what a clusterfuck this was, and gave me a credit of $250, which I used for some AirPods Pro 3, and the guy in-store also gave me an Ultra Watch band for free. I also ended up with a negative loan balance of $260, which I got back as a check, and when you add back the $120 gift card back from July, I ended up doing ok. \n\nBut, it was an incredible time and energy suck and I did have to drop $1400 all in one go. I am lucky that I could just do that otherwise I would have left the store without my phone and then who knows what would have happened. I do not recommend this adventure to anyone. \n\nHopefully by the time the next phones are released there will be a proper integrated upgrade path, but for now, if you want to preserve your sanity, just stick with Theft and Loss coverage.\n\n ",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\nI've built Moadly, a freemium app that has 25 different mini-games you can unlock and play to keep your memory/brain sharp.\n \nThere's been studies on how doing simple exercises can actually help with memory (or at least slow down cognitive decline). I've mainly built it for myself but there seem to be other players that find it helpful so i thought it would also share it here.  \n\nThe game is fully playable/unlockable for free but you also have the option to pay to remove the ads.\n\nHere's the Appstore link: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moadly-train-your-brain/id6751052322\n\n\nThanks. Feedback appreciated!",

    "title": "Hazel is overkill for 90% of users. Mine works in 3 clicks.",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple! 👋\n\nI'm excited to share Neatify, a macOS productivity app I've been working on for automatic file organization.\n\n# \"Wait, isn't this just Hazel?\"\n\nFair question. I know Hazel exists, and it's an incredibly powerful tool. But here's the thing: Hazel is built for people who love to customize every detail. **Neatify is built for people who want their files organized instantly, without setup or scripting.**\n\n**I made Neatify for people who:**\n\n* Value automation that works right away\n* Want images in one folder, PDFs in another, done\n* Prefer project-based file routing without extra configuration\n* Want clarity instead of complexity\n\nThink of it this way: Hazel is a custom-built PC. Neatify is a MacBook that just works.\n\nBoth are powerful, but one lets you skip the setup and get things done faster.\n\nIf you enjoy building complex automation workflows, Hazel is fantastic. If you just want your files to go where they belong while you focus on your work, Neatify is built for you.\n\n# The Problem I'm Solving\n\nYou're working on multiple projects simultaneously. Literature essay, art history presentation, geopolitics research paper. Files are everywhere. Downloads folder is chaos. Every time you save or download something, you face decision fatigue: \"Where should this go?\"\n\nYou could use Hazel, but after 30 minutes of documentation and rule setup, you're more overwhelmed than when you started.\n\n# How Neatify Works\n\n**🎯 Project-Based Organization**\n\nCreate a project structure in 3 clicks:\n\n1. Name your project (e.g., \"Literature Essay\")\n2. Select file types to manage (Images, PDFs, Presentations)\n3. Choose location (Desktop, Documents, wherever)\n\nDone. Now every image you download automatically goes to Literature Essay/Images. Every PDF to Literature Essay/PDFs. No manual sorting.\n\n**⚡️ Smart File Sorting with Saved Rules**\n\nCreate reusable sorting configurations. One for work, one for personal files, one for creative projects. Switch between them from the menu bar in one click.\n\n**🔄 Quick Sorter**\n\nNeed to organize something right now? Quick Sorter lets you point at a folder, pick file types, and start sorting immediately. Perfect for one-off tasks.\n\n**🧹 Bulk File Organizer**\n\nGot a messy folder with 500 mixed files? Select it, and Neatify reorganizes everything into a clean structure (Visual/Images, Visual/Videos, Audio, Code/Frontend, Code/Backend, Documents, etc.) in seconds.\n\n**🚀 Set It and Forget It**\n\nEnable \"Launch at Login\" with a default project or rule. Neatify runs silently in your menu bar. Your files stay organized without you thinking about it.\n\n**📊 Menu Bar Control**\n\nClose the app, it lives in your menu bar. Switch sorting rules, pause/resume, or check status without opening the main window.\n\n# Why I Built This\n\nI was constantly switching between projects and drowning in file chaos. I tried Hazel, spent hours configuring it, felt more stressed, and thought: \"There has to be a simpler way.\"\n\nSo I built Neatify to do one thing really well: keep your files organized so you can focus on your work, not your folders.\n\nIt's 100% native macOS (Swift + SwiftUI), optimized for performance, and follows Apple's design language. No Electron bloat.\n\n# Try the Beta\n\nNeatify is currently in public beta on TestFlight. I'd genuinely love your feedback, especially from anyone who's tried Hazel and found it too heavy, or anyone juggling multiple projects who's tired of file chaos.\n\nBeta Access: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/Eyp3uwZS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Eyp3uwZS)  \nWebsite: [https://neatifyhq.com](https://neatifyhq.com)  \nDemo: [https://neatifyhq.com/#demo](https://neatifyhq.com/#demo)\n\nI'd Love Your Thoughts On\n\n* Does the \"simpler alternative to Hazel\" positioning make sense?\n* What file organization pain points do you face daily?\n* For Hazel users: what would make you consider a faster, easier tool?\n* Any concerns about automatic file management?\n\nI'll be here all day answering questions, discussing workflows, or debating the merits of different organization philosophies. Thanks for reading! 🙏",

As someone who uses 3 screens (two external and a mac), this solves a real issue for me because I like to assign each screen a purpose (communications, development, design) to make my workflow clearer.\n\n[ExtraDock](https://extradock.app/?ref=rapple) doesn't require any permission to work, it is fully customizable (colors, size, auto-hide, show on hover and more), and works offline.\n\nThere's a full demo and feature list on the [website](https://extradock.app/?ref=rapple), so feel free to check it out!

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAbout two months ago I released a major update to my weather app [Sonuby Weather](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1560347507?pt=122856099&ct=r_apple_october_2025&mt=8), which some of you might remember from my [Promo Sunday post last December](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1hjwv12/i_built_a_fully_customizable_forecast_app_for/).\n\nThe latest update features the first truly configurable weather widgets for iOS, letting you build your personal forecast dashboard right on your home screen.\n\n**Here's what makes them special:**\n\n* **3 widget types** \\- Now & Next Hours (up to 42h on iPad), Next Days (up to 12 days), and Now & Next Hours Extended for twice the variables\n* **9 specialized reports** \\- Choose between Daily Life, Health, Snow Sports, Surfing, Photography, Hiking, and more - each showing relevant variables for that activity\n* **Truly customizable** \\- Don't like the default layout? Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

Staying healthy was becoming a second full-time job.\n\n**👉 So I built** [**Nori**](https://nori.ai)**.**\n\nNori is an AI health coach that connects all your health data (Apple Health, Oura, Whoop, Garmin, labs, whatever) and tells you what to actually do to get healthier.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Syncs all your wearables and health apps automatically\n* AI analyzes patterns across sleep, workouts, nutrition, biomarkers\n* Gives you personalized daily insights and recommendations\n* One conversation interface instead of 5+ apps\n\n**Real examples from my own data:**\n\n* I got stronger when I *added* rest days instead of grinding 6-7 workouts weekly\n* Magnesium at bedtime increased my REM sleep by 25%\n* When I miss a workout, it tells me exactly how to adjust\n\n**🙌 Giving away 25 free invites to readers of** r/apple **so you can try the app**.  \n**🍎 Use invite code APPLE.** \n\nI'm especially looking for Apple Watch users focused on weight loss, energy, or recovery.\n\nIf you try it, I'd love feedback—and an App Store review would mean a lot to me 🙏\n\n**App store link:** [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nori-ai-own-your-health/id6746278715](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nori-ai-own-your-health/id6746278715)  \n**🍎 First 25 to try it - use invite code APPLE.**  (Update: this should work now, sorry!)\n\n**Website:** [https://nori.ai](https://nori.ai)\n\nThanks so much—really looking forward to hearing what you think!  \nDave",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI’d like to share the app I’ve been working on over the past few months - **Dory**.\n\nI think the video does a much better job of explaining what it’s all about, so feel free to check it out here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z\\_Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z_Q)\n\n**Dory is an app switcher that lets you quickly cycle through apps without moving your hand from the mouse, keyboard or trackpad - and without needing to remember any shortcuts.**\n\nClick a mouse button - or a modifier key if both hands are on the keyboard - and type the first letter of the app’s name.\n\nFind apps using the first letter, middle letters, acronyms, or similar names.\n\nIf multiple apps share that letter, just keep tapping it to cycle through them.\n\nYou can also press the middle mouse button and start typing the app’s name directly.\n\nPrefer tapping over holding? No problem. With Press Mode, you can open Dory’s sleek UI using a global shortcut or a **trackpad gesture!** (new)\n\nDory works right out of the box - and over time, it learns which apps you use most and prioritizes them.\n\nNo extra shortcuts.\n\nNo setup. Nothing to remember.\n\n\\--\n\nIt's currently $4.99 on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dory-app-switcher/id6746273626?mt=12) (**One-time purchase**. **No subscription.**) for a limited time.",

Apple claims that this system is private and secure, but the code is proprietary, and such claims have to be taken on faith. It is well known that even with perfect cryptographic guarantees, logical flaws might creep into protocols, and allow undesirable attacks.\n\nThis paper presents a symbolic model of the Find My protocol, as well as a precise formal specification of desirable properties.",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAbout two months ago I released a major update to my weather app [Sonuby Weather](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1560347507?pt=122856099&ct=r_apple_october_2025&mt=8), which some of you might remember from my [Promo Sunday post last December](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1hjwv12/i_built_a_fully_customizable_forecast_app_for/).\n\nThe latest update features the first truly configurable weather widgets for iOS, letting you build your personal forecast dashboard right on your home screen.\n\n**Here's what makes them special:**\n\n* **3 widget types** \\- Now & Next Hours (up to 42h on iPad), Next Days (up to 12 days), and Now & Next Hours Extended for twice the variables\n* **9 specialized reports** \\- Choose between Daily Life, Health, Snow Sports, Surfing, Photography, Hiking, and more - each showing relevant variables for that activity\n* **Truly customizable** \\- Don't like the default layout? Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

But never used it before. \n\nFrom what I read, we can take it to apple for it to be repaired for a fee, or request and express replacement for a bit higher fee where they send a replacement and you post your phone number \n\nWhat happens when they repair yours? Do they then send it back, you swap again, and send the replacement back?\n\nWhen they repair yours phone due to a broken glass, do they also replace the battery (automatically or upon request)? As it’s 90% already, it would be a good opportunity to get a refresh battery. \n\nIf we get a refurbished replacement, do they always come with a new battery?\n\nI read online that people just smash up their phone to get a new one or dip it in water, it just doesn’t sit right with me but I really would like the battery to be refreshed (as it dropped to 90% rather quickly) or get a refurbished one without feeling too bad ethically.

I had read a lot of negative stuff about them on here but watched a video of a guy who performed testing on a bunch of different screen protectors and declared flolabs to be a winner so I took a chance. I was actually pleasantly surprised by ship time as I had read they come from China and take two weeks to get, but I had mine within 5 days & it was shipped from California. Install was easy, there was a slight light bleed if you looked at the sides from an extreme angle but not noticeable if you weren’t looking for it.\n\nHowever, I noticed today, the very top of the screen protector had cracked and the bottom was almost disintegrating, even though I’ve not dropped my phone or had any kind of rough usage. I filed a warranty claim, though it’s disappointing that I will have to pay for shipping on a product that barely lasted a week under light usage. I also ordered an origarmor screen protector from Amazon so I can compare and see which is better.  \n\nOther than the cracking, I was actually very happy with the screen protector but cracking after a week of very gentle use is ridiculous, I’ve bought cheap Amazon screen protectors that have held up longer than that. It’s possible it could be due to my case (casekoo magic stand) as it doesn’t have much of a raised lip on the front, I have a rokform rugged coming tomorrow so I will try the replacement with that case, if I end up having issues with my origarmor protector.

    "selftext": "Hi! I’m in need of some major assistance transferring all my photos & videos from my old phone to my current one! \n\nI recently cracked/broke the back on my iPhone 15 Plus which affected the motherboard as I was told from multiple repair shops, so long story short the phone basically turns on & off every 2-3mins. It got so bad & frequent it wouldn’t even connect to my service provider fast enough before it would shut off again hence the SOS at the top right. I eventually had to take out my SIM card & put it in an old iPhone X I had to even have a capable phone for now but my main issue is…. \n\nIs there any way possible for me to transfer my photos & videos from my old iPhone 15 Plus to this iPhone X or onto a laptop without losing any of it??\n\nAre you able to transfer from a turned off iPhone? \n\nIs any way to transfer or send from one phone to the other?\n\nIs there anyway for me to fix this or find any kind of solution?\n\nI never backed up everything on iCloud or iTunes as I never used iTunes & was having some iCloud account issues so that didn’t work either. I tried airdropping them but it says I need my Bluetooth & WiFi on for that but those wont work based on the condition the phone is currently in 🤦🏾‍♂️ I was stupidly waiting until I bought a MacBook so I could eventually transfer everything on there & sort out my iCloud issues, hoping my phone never got broken in the meantime then would back up everything but here I am. (lol I’m new to the iPhone Apple community give me some grace now but I know not smart)\n\nI’ve tried everything at this point & just researching for any new information or result but as of right now my last solution is to put my SIM card back into the iPhone 15 and try to have it connect to my provider if possible & email myself whatever I can quick enough then save them on the new phone but that is A LOT work, burns too much & for sure will be irritating asf!!\n\nBtw I’m keeping this iPhone X until I can get a new phone before the year is done, iPhone 16 or 17 more than likely but then I will have to transfer everything onto that so I’d like for everything to be smooth by then \n\nAny help or advice would be major right now!!!",

Meanwhile on r/caudabe some people that ordered their cases last week are getting them before others that ordered them over a month ago. For the premium prices we pay for these cases ($57 after tax) it's insane that this garbage company wants to make zero actual amends for paying customers while continuing to make excuses. Several people have tried canceling their order and the customer service team doesn't even have the decency to get back to them in a timely fashion.\n\nOh and the cases that are shipping apparently have rattling buttons, which will apparently be replaced based on the degree they bother the end user.\n\nNever, ever again.",

I just found out they don’t allow videos here, so I will attach photos. In photos the bar is at different level but its brightening the screen at same level, if I go lower than that it will further dim the screen but doesn’t make any difference if I go all the way up.\nAny advice is appreciated.",

Sometimes, especially when I raise the volume, it feels like there’s a slight buzzing or distortion — not super loud, but noticeable if I focus on it.\n\nWhat’s weird is that it doesn’t happen all the time. For example, I just tried listening to a few songs and they sounded fine —  So now I’m wondering if it’s just certain sounds or frequencies that make it happen, or maybe a software thing.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar with their 17 Pro?

I wear a phone case that has lived but remains stubborn, it was on my phone when I fell but it did not prevent the appearance of cracks downwards and a long one towards the top of the phone yet the case had nothing. I would like to know if I can use my phone as usual, use it long enough, play games, write messages, use it for my alarm clocks... Without causing other problems with cracks, for example because of the heat of my phone after a long time of use, I keep my case to avoid dust on the back. Or do I have to avoid using it for too long periods of time so that it doesn't heat up too much, do I have to stop the habits I have with my phone?\n\nChances are that it will take me a while to change the back of my phone so I would like to do my best to limit the problems for my iPhone.\n\nIn addition, I have the touch screen which is very slightly raised on the top of the phone which means that when you press on the top, it sinks slightly and I thought I saw twice problems at the top of my screen when I used it\n\nThank you in advance to all those who will help me, This is my first post on this subreddit",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

When they set up & activated their iPhones, not only does it show that he indeed has AppleCare+ attached to the iPhone, but that the policy until 2034, nine years from now, which is insane as AppleCare+ is only for 2 years and then you can extend it afterwards up to a total of 5 years on a per month basis. We went back to the Genius Bar and had them check the serial number on Mobile Genius, and it is indeed genuine and an actual policy #. Totally covered. So now I’m actually wondering what happens in 9 years when the iPhone Air is officially considered “vintage” or “obsolete”, how do they even go about repairs or replacement if anything were to happen to it? I’ve never seen this before. ",

After looking it up in the settings, i noticed that it was turned on by default and (!) that im unable to turn it off. Any ideas or tips on how to get rid of this would be greatly appreciated :)\n\nOoh and as a heads-up (if that is important) im not using Face-ID at all",

But never used it before. \n\nFrom what I read, we can take it to apple for it to be repaired for a fee, or request and express replacement for a bit higher fee where they send a replacement and you post your phone number \n\nWhat happens when they repair yours? Do they then send it back, you swap again, and send the replacement back?\n\nWhen they repair yours phone due to a broken glass, do they also replace the battery (automatically or upon request)? As it’s 90% already, it would be a good opportunity to get a refresh battery. \n\nIf we get a refurbished replacement, do they always come with a new battery?\n\nI read online that people just smash up their phone to get a new one or dip it in water, it just doesn’t sit right with me but I really would like the battery to be refreshed (as it dropped to 90% rather quickly) or get a refurbished one without feeling too bad ethically. What is the best way? ",

I had read a lot of negative stuff about them on here but watched a video of a guy who performed testing on a bunch of different screen protectors and declared flolabs to be a winner so I took a chance. I was actually pleasantly surprised by ship time as I had read they come from China and take two weeks to get, but I had mine within 5 days & it was shipped from California. Install was easy, there was a slight light bleed if you looked at the sides from an extreme angle but not noticeable if you weren’t looking for it.\n\nHowever, I noticed today, the very top of the screen protector had cracked and the bottom was almost disintegrating, even though I’ve not dropped my phone or had any kind of rough usage. I filed a warranty claim, though it’s disappointing that I will have to pay for shipping on a product that barely lasted a week under light usage. I also ordered an origarmor screen protector from Amazon so I can compare and see which is better.  \n\nOther than the cracking, I was actually very happy with the screen protector but cracking after a week of very gentle use is ridiculous, I’ve bought cheap Amazon screen protectors that have held up longer than that. It’s possible it could be due to my case (casekoo magic stand) as it doesn’t have much of a raised lip on the front, I have a rokform rugged coming tomorrow so I will try the replacement with that case, if I end up having issues with my origarmor protector.

It got so bad & frequent it wouldn’t even connect to my service provider fast enough before it would shut off again hence the SOS at the top right. I eventually had to take out my SIM card & put it in an old iPhone X I had to even have a capable phone for now but my main issue is…. \n\nIs there any way possible for me to transfer my photos & videos from my old iPhone 15 Plus to this iPhone X or onto a laptop without losing any of it??\n\nAre you able to transfer from a turned off iPhone? \n\nIs any way to transfer or send from one phone to the other?\n\nIs there anyway for me to fix this or find any kind of solution?\n\nI never backed up everything on iCloud or iTunes as I never used iTunes & was having some iCloud account issues so that didn’t work either. I tried airdropping them but it says I need my Bluetooth & WiFi on for that but those wont work based on the condition the phone is currently in 🤦🏾‍♂️ I was stupidly waiting until I bought a MacBook so I could eventually transfer everything on there & sort out my iCloud issues, hoping my phone never got broken in the meantime then would back up everything but here I am. (lol I’m new to the iPhone Apple community give me some grace now but I know not smart)\n\nI’ve tried everything at this point & just researching for any new information or result but as of right now my last solution is to put my SIM card back into the iPhone 15 and try to have it connect to my provider if possible & email myself whatever I can quick enough then save them on the new phone but that is A LOT work, burns too much & for sure will be irritating asf!!\n\nBtw I’m keeping this iPhone X until I can get a new phone before the year is done, iPhone 16 or 17 more than likely but then I will have to transfer everything onto that so I’d like for everything to be smooth by then \n\nAny help or advice would be major right now!!!",

When they set up & activated their iPhones, not only does it show that he indeed has AppleCare+ attached to the iPhone, but that the policy until 2034, nine years from now, which is insane as AppleCare+ is only for 2 years and then you can extend it afterwards up to a total of 5 years on a per month basis. We went back to the Genius Bar and had them check the serial number on Mobile Genius, and it is indeed genuine and an actual policy #. Totally covered. So now I’m actually wondering what happens in 9 years when the iPhone Air is officially considered “vintage” or “obsolete”, how do they even go about repairs or replacement if anything were to happen to it? I’ve never seen this before. ",

Toggle on the Show in Share Sheet option. Tap Done.\n\nStep 3: Use the shortcut Name the shortcut something like \"Message Myself\" and choose an icon.

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Compared to traditional Linux distros, Android is very restricted, the newer versions even more so, it is very hard to root too. So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "selftext": "I've never owned a galaxy S8 (used apple, oneplus, pixel, then my first samsung was my current s24 ultra), but I feel like it's the most influential Android phone in the last 10 years in terms of physical design. It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Has *anyone in the general public* actually received their Titan 2 yet?\n2. If yes, how’s it holding up — build quality, battery, keyboard feel, software stability, camera, etc.?\n3. Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Samsung is canceling the upcoming s26 edge completly. but should it?\n\nCurrent reports say its because of poor sales of the 25 edge (only 178k in the first month) vs the other s series (s25 ultra with 1.5m, s25 with more than 1m). \n\nFor my opinion, the poor sales of the s25 edge were caused only because thats a new technology and it was mostly a prototype phone.\nIt had many problems and seemed rushed and unfinished (wasnt that thin, small battery, no telephoto camera). It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

    "selftext": "Would love to know some tips and tricks from the experts who have turned and twisted android to create something personal and functional. \n\n\nInitial impressions for me: (First 2 days)\nWhat's better in Android:\n1) The key board - I am not making as many mistakes as I used to when typing on the 14 pro\n2) Autofilling of OTPs - just removed one more step and feels faster \n3) Pixel animations are smooth and fast - atleast better than my 14 pro and my friends 15 pro \n4) Google assistant/ Gemini is just way better \n5) loving the battery on the 10 xl compared to the smaller 14 pro \n6) The universal back gesture. Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have a Google Pixel 8, still under the EU 3-year legal warranty. The phone suddenly stopped working overnight while charging normally.\n\nI sent it for repair through the official Google channel and received a diagnosis of “liquid damage”, with a repair quote of € 644.52 (out of warranty).\n\nHowever, the phone was never exposed to water. I asked Google Support for objective technical evidence (report, photos, LCI readings, methodology, technician ID, etc.), but they said they don’t have any documentation or photos, since the device was returned immediately after I declined the quote.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2019/771 (transposed in Portugal as Decree-Law 84/2021), sellers must provide technical proof when excluding warranty due to alleged misuse — otherwise, the fault is presumed to have existed at delivery.\n\nThe case was escalated to a “second-line” team three days ago, but I haven’t received any update.\n\nHas anyone in the EU experienced a similar situation with Google repairs? Were you able to get photos, a technical report, or have the decision overturned?\n\nI just want a transparent and evidence-based assessment — nothing more, nothing less.",

I've been working on something I think you'll find useful. **Media Bar** transforms your Android status bar into a functional media controller and progress indicator.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nInstead of pulling down notifications or switching apps to control your music/podcast/video, you can now:\n\n* **See media progress** as a thin colored bar along your status bar\n* **Swipe left/right** on the status bar to scrub through your media\n* **Tap, double-tap, or long-press** three invisible regions on the status bar for custom actions (play/pause, skip, jump forward/back, launch app, etc.)\n\n**How is this different from Android's Live Notifications or OneUI's Now Bar?**\n\nWhile Android's live notifications and Samsung's Now Bar are excellent features, Media Bar takes a different approach:\n\n* **Always visible, minimal footprint** \\- Just a thin line on your status bar (can be as small as 1 pixel), not a pill or expandable widget that takes screen real estate\n* **Blind muscle memory control** \\- Your entire status bar becomes an interactive surface. No need to look for or tap specific small buttons\n* **Works system-wide** \\- Doesn't matter which media app you're using or which Android skin you have\n* **Swipe to scrub** \\- Directly scrub through your media by swiping, rather than tapping skip buttons\n* **Deep customization** \\- Color coding for progress tracking, custom button zones, transparency options, etc.\n\nThink of it as complementary to those features - it's for when you want the most minimal, muscle-memory-based control possible.\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nI found myself constantly interrupting my workflow to control media playback - whether I was gaming, browsing, or working. I wanted something that was always visible and accessible without being intrusive.\n\n**The \"aha\" moment:**\n\nHere's the thing - **Media Bar might feel a bit unusual at first, but give it a day or two.** Once your muscle memory kicks in, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.\n\nImagine this: You're at the gym mid-rep and need to pause your music. Instead of fumbling to find the play button, your thumb just *knows* where to tap on the status bar. Or you're deep into a 3-hour podcast and want to skip ahead - a quick swipe does it without even looking.\n\n**That's the magic**: your fingers learn the zones, and suddenly media control becomes second nature. No more hunting for tiny buttons or pulling focus from what you're doing. It just... flows. I'm confident that once it becomes part of your routine, it'll feel indispensable.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n**Color coding options** \\- Solid colors, dynamic (based on album art/app), segments (changes color at different progress points), or gradients\n\n**Highly customizable** \\- Adjust the bar's thickness (down to 1 pixel!), position (top/bottom), transparency, button regions, and more\n\n**Smart behavior** \\- Auto-hides in fullscreen apps, works with any media player\n\nIf you want to give it a shot, [get it from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.mediabar)! I would love to hear what you guys think about it and happy to answer any questions you may have! I would specifically like to hear if you build a muscle memory for it! :)",

The issue got escalated to an incident this morning.\n\nWell, I just got news that Google thinks the Pixel hanging/crashing apps bug is now fixed. I've asked for clarification on whether the fix is server-side or requires a Play Services update. https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1977868145840050230\n\n**Update**: Alright, got confirmation that the Pixel crashing/hanging apps fix is server-side. There will be a post-mortem within Google, but I'm not sure if it will be made public. Incidents like this one cannot happen again.

    "title": "I Switched from iPhone to Android: My Story of Losses and Gains",
    "selftext": "# Hey Reddit! I want to share my story of switching from iPhone to Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It wasn't just choosing a new phone; it was a real journey full of expectations, doubts, and unexpected discoveries.\n\n# Introduction: Seeking a New Experience\n\nI used an iPhone 13 Pro and it was almost perfect. Even when the Pixel 10 came out, I had no desire to watch the presentation. But over time, I started to feel a \"technological itch.\" I was tired of Apple's predictability and the lack of true innovation. When the 17th iPhone came out again without significant AI improvements, it was the final disappointment. On the horizon appeared the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra — a symbol of freedom, customization, and powerful AI. This wasn't just a phone choice; it was a choice of a new philosophy. I dreamed of a world where I control my device, not the other way around.\n\n# Part I: Pros and Cons from My Experience\n\niPhone (iOS): The World I Left Behind\n\n•Pros (What I Miss):\n\n•\"Ecosystem magic\" is not a myth, but a reality. It's not just a set of features, but an invisible fabric that connects the family. I acutely felt this when I realized I could no longer see my wife's phone battery charge (a symbol of care) and disappeared from our shared fitness competition (a symbol of play and unity).\n\n•Flawless simplicity (\"It just works\"). AirPods connecting with animation, passwords autofilling without glitches, stable battery performance after updates. This reliability is not \"boring,\" but reassuring. It brings peace of mind, freeing my brain from having to \"fix\" basic things.\n\n•Predictability as an advantage. I always know what to expect. No unpleasant surprises, like a sudden battery drain or strange sleep metrics on the watch after an update. It's a world without rollercoasters.\n\n•Camera philosophy. The iPhone camera strives for a \"cinematic\" reality. It creates volumetric, pleasing-to-the-eye photos immediately, without the need to \"tinker\" with settings.\n\n•Well-designed password system. Passwords seemed like a simple app. But it's so well-designed that you don't need to remember many passwords; importantly, it generates passwords itself and works across other devices.\n\n•Integrated calls and messages. The ability to call other messengers from the built-in call app and a convenient built-in messaging app.\n\n•Health and fitness synchronization. Easy synchronization of a fitness tracker and app with the built-in health app.\n\n•Battery life. I'm impressed that such a small battery lasts an active day. No need to turn off Bluetooth and WiFi to save power.\n\n•User care. Features related to health, diary, and headphone usage monitoring.\n\n•Sound quality. Good sound from the speakers and the phone itself.\n\n•Size and dimensions. Exactly what I was looking for.\n\n•Face ID. A very convenient feature, especially at work where fingerprint unlock might be inconvenient.\n\n•Seamless Bluetooth connection. No problems connecting to Bluetooth devices.\n\n•Reminders. The \"Reminders\" app is very helpful for organizing thoughts and tasks.\n\n•Cons (Why I Left):\n\n•\"Golden cage.\" The feeling of being locked in. Dependence on AirDrop, iMessage, lack of flexibility. The desire to break free and try something new was incredibly strong.\n\n•Illusion of innovation. Annual updates brought minimal changes but cost maximum money. It felt like a waste.\n\n•Lack of control. I can't customize the system to my liking. I'm forced to live by Apple's rules. This is annoying when I know there could be something better and more convenient for me.\n\n•Notification limitations. Inability to change notification sounds in Instagram and Viber.\n\n•Browser limitations. On iPhone, you can't choose which browser to open news from the Google News app, which leads to a lot of ads.\n\nSamsung (Android/One UI): The World I Chose\n\n•Pros (What I'm Fighting For):\n\n•True freedom and customization. The ability to customize everything — from the desktop to system functions via Good Lock. It's the feeling that you are the master of your device. It's my own home where I choose the wall color.\n\n•Powerful, ahead-of-its-time innovations. Galaxy AI, enhanced camera capabilities (after configuration), DeX. I feel like I'm using the technologies of the future today.\n\n•Sense of uniqueness. I'm not \"one of the crowd.\" My choice is conscious and differs from the mainstream. This brings a certain intellectual satisfaction.\n\n•Small things that make life easier. A more convenient messenger, a better keyboard, no \"crutches\" for basic things (like listening to music from the browser).\n\n•System openness. The ability to install modded YouTube and YouTube Music apps, which works great.\n\n•Circle to Search. The on-screen search function works great.\n\n•Watch integration. Notifications from my device work on my watch, which was an important factor.\n\n•Step transfer. Steps from the phone are transferred to the watch, allowing me to see full activity statistics.\n\n•Browser control. The ability to uncheck \"open in built-in browser\" for news, which helps avoid ads.\n\n•Cons (The Harsh Truth):\n\n•Freedom requires work. Customization is not only joy but also a necessity. Sometimes this necessity turns into \"repair.\" When I have to fix basic functions (battery, sleep tracking) after an update, it's no longer \"customization\" but fixing manufacturer errors.\n\n•Fragility of innovations. The latest features can be \"raw\" and break. This undermines trust. I expect stability from a flagship but get beta testing for my own money.\n\n•Emotional isolation. The most significant drawback. I fall out of familiar family \"digital rituals.\" This creates a feeling of loneliness and makes me wonder if technological freedom is worth this emotional price.\n\n•Camera quality. Photos come out \"flat,\" without the depth or volume that iPhone has. Videos are also not top-notch. I want the phone to do this for me, not force me to \"play with photos.\" iPhone handles this, even the 13 Pro.\n\n•UI appearance. The iPhone's lock screen looks better.\n\n•Reminders and calendar. Reminder events don't appear in the calendar by default, and while there are workarounds, it feels like a \"crutch.\"\n\n•Weather app. The iPhone's weather app is more detailed; Samsung just redirects to a web page.\n\n•Passwords. The built-in password app doesn't always work on time or connect to save new passwords. I had to install Bitwarden.\n\n•Watch. Although notifications work, auto-tracking for cycling didn't start, and heart rate shows incorrectly during elliptical workouts.\n\n# Part II: The Main Conclusion I Reached\n\nI realized that my choice wasn't between two phones. It was a choice between two life priorities: personal technological freedom and seamless family integration.\n\nI left iPhone because I valued the first. I started to miss it because I underestimated the importance of the second.\n\nThe problem isn't that Samsung is bad and iPhone is good. The problem is that an ideal world where there is both absolute freedom and absolute integration with family on another platform does not exist. And each of us is forced to choose which of these two values is more important to us at a given moment in life.\n\nMy struggle is not an attempt to prove that Samsung is better. It's an attempt to find a way to \"build bridges\" between my new free world and the cozy \"digital home\" where my family remained. And I don't know yet if I will succeed.\n\nMy choice of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was wise, economically justified, and aligns with my desire for innovation and freedom. The only thing I need to do is give myself permission to fully transition to Samsung. Stop comparing and start enjoying my new device. True perfectionism is not demanding an ideal, but achieving maximum comfort with minimal expenditure of resources (time, money, nerves). That's exactly what I did.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI’ve been using an iPhone 17 Pro Max for a few weeks, mainly for content creation (Reels, short cinematic clips, fitness/gym stuff, and occasional fire performances) — and while the camera quality is amazing, the file transfer and workflow side is driving me insane.\n\nI edit both on my phone (CapCut) and PC (Windows). iCloud + iTunes + “Save to Photos” steps feel like a nightmare compared to simple drag-and-drop or Google Drive sync on Android. It honestly kills the efficiency of my whole process.\n\nSo now I’m looking to switch back to Android and want your advice on what’s currently the best phone for video creators in 2025.\nI care most about:\n\t•\t🎥 Video quality (1×/2×) and realistic color for quick IG posts\n\t•\t⚙️ Simple file transfer to PC (no cloud hoops)\n\t•\t📱 Stable performance for 4K clips and CapCut/LumaFusion editing\n\t•\t🔋 Battery / heat management for 10–20 min recordings\n\t•\t⚡ Optional: good telephoto for stage/fire show shots\n\nFrom what I’ve seen:\n\t•\tPixel 10 Pro looks closest to iPhone-style auto color/WB but maybe underpowered?\n\t•\tS25 Ultra seems unbeatable for tele and versatility.\n\t•\tXiaomi 15 Ultra has crazy creative potential, but I’m not sure about reliability or color accuracy straight out of camera.\n\nSo, if you’ve tested these (or any others) for content creation, what’s your pick?\nWhat are you using for video workflow → edit → upload right now?\nAny tips for making Android as “ready-to-post” as iPhone would be super appreciated 🙏",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

I asked Google Support for objective technical evidence (report, photos, LCI readings, methodology, technician ID, etc.), but they said they don’t have any documentation or photos, since the device was returned immediately after I declined the quote.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2019/771 (transposed in Portugal as Decree-Law 84/2021), sellers must provide technical proof when excluding warranty due to alleged misuse — otherwise, the fault is presumed to have existed at delivery.\n\nThe case was escalated to a “second-line” team three days ago, but I haven’t received any update.\n\nHas anyone in the EU experienced a similar situation with Google repairs? Were you able to get photos, a technical report, or have the decision overturned?\n\nI just want a transparent and evidence-based assessment — nothing more, nothing less.",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device’s screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A €500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn’t I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google’s assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can’t even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen’s problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle’s written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don’t know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I’ve been for months without my phone, and it’ll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google’s abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this! Best wishes. 🙂",

Not having much luck troubleshooting online, so if anyone has suggestions for either of these, help would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n1. No longer autocompleting Google searches. The phone asked if I wanted to sync information across devices, which I thought I'd done on my last one, so I said yes. Since agreeing to that, I no longer get autocomplete/suggested searches for Google searches (on my phone or on my laptop). When I start typing a question, all that comes up is my own previous queries. I do have the Trending Search setting turned on. I also tried turning on the personalized autocomplete setting, but all that did was start including websites I have saved to my bookmarks. I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, and restarting the phone, but nothing helps \n\n2. Discover won't go away. I've ensured the discover setting is off, but I still get an MSN-style list of news stories every time I open a new tab or spend time away from a tab (I come back to it, and the content is minimized with an option to pick back up where I left off... with an MSN-style list of stories beneath it). This one is still working correctly on my laptop (no stories shown to me there), but it's making me a bit nuts that it won't go away on the Pixel. Again here, I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, restarting the phone, to no avail.\n\nThanks again for any tips!",

I used to use custom launchers back in the day but they seem more finicky and glitchy with newer phones. I loved Android because I could customize everything to fit my personality and now they're making us like Apple. It feels like the same pull to minimalism and sad beige aesthetic that is plaguing homes and businesses (looking at you McDonald's and Taco Bell) now a days. All personality is being sucked out. I want choices without needing a custom launcher. ",

My last phone was a Nothing 2a and the ones before that were primary Xiaomi phones. I never had a feeling of finishednes and high quality in my hands before. Although the Chip and the battery aren't the best on a or specifically this foldable, I always wanted one and went all in. I love everything about it and even the noticeable grace of this foldable is rather pleasant to me, I wanted a foldable, I got one, and it only reminds me of the fact that it's foldable.\n\nNow to the rent part of this post, the camera. I'm not a camera guy at all. The years before I didn't even transport or safe my pictures before changing the phone so I lost them every time. It was nothing memorable, just pictures of things to remind me of or something.\nBut with pixel, as it was considered the best phone camera for a long time, I thought, I'd look into it. It looks well done as everything does, but why can't I have the option to just shoot raw in the full, advertised 48mp?\n\nEvery other pixel phone has the option as far as I know and even Gemini told me that it's there, even after the proof of multiple screenshots. It just sounds like a no brainer to just not included the option because, why not.\nI read things online about pixel binging and all the different stuff, but after all, let the people decide what they want after they paid about 1800€ for a brand new phone with the camera of lasts gen, which, btw. had the option to select 48mp raw.\nI won't really need it, it just noticed it and got pissed off, because when I shoot pictures, I also want raw in full quality!\n\nWhy Google, just why? It's such a small thing and yet so dumb!\n\nIf I'm missing something, please correct me!",

The past two years I switched to the Apple echosystem.. I actually really liked it because it brought me back to the basics and it managed to handle basic task very very very good. Build quality felt amazing and the camera's were amazing. Because of some compatibilty issues with work I had to switch to Android. Again, choosing the Samsung over every other phone because of the looks and performance (on paper). \n\nI realised that the Apple Echosystem is very restrictive so I don't think I will ever switch back to Apple again.\n\nSo here I am... looking into a Pixel because it really gives me Apple vibes, as if Samsung and the iPhone had a baby.\n\nSo, I have a few questions before I consider taking the Pixel (I think I will wait for the Pixel 11):\n\n1. How is the camera? I really like taking Portrait pictures with my phone.  \n2. I had a few moments with the Pixel in a phone store but I couldn't get all out. But it looked to me like as if the widgets were very limited. I normally use the weather widget and the google agenda widget on my homescreen, the google agenda widget on the Samsung shows the full month with the daily tasks on the screen. It didnt look like Pixel has the same widget option. Does anyone know wether this is customizable?  \n3. How is gaming on the Pixel? I sometimes like to play games like Genshin Impact or Wuthering Waves\n\nThank you all",

    "title": "Pixel 9 gap between screen and frame + other potential issues, should I RMA?",
    "selftext": "Purchased a Pixel 9 about a month ago while on vacation in another country because my previous phone gave out. I noticed that there is a noticeable gap between the screen and the frame (enough to slot a piece of paper in), mostly uniform but slightly more pronounced at the bottom. The screen is also ever so slightly raised up from frame level.\n\nI didn't request for the device to be replaced because I was due to leave for the country I live in in just a few days, also because there was conflicting information online on whether this was normal or not.\n\nI also recently noticed that sometimes there's this faint cluster of pixels flashing green just under the selfie camera cutout (happens only on lower brightness settings), although I'm not sure if it's a hardware issue because I haven't seen it before, and I would definitely have noticed it before if it happened. I don't think it's dead/stuck pixels either because I don't see this happening when I view solid colours on the screen. Also since this phone has a Samsung display and not a BOE one, so the chances are lower. It's usually intermittent but it has stopped happening for now.\n\nI also understand that the gap probably won't void the water resistance because it's not the size of the gap that protects the device, rather the glue under the screen that attaches the display to the frame.\n\nAnyway, I contacted Google support today, and the support agent was more than willing to start an RMA when I asked for it, and said they'd send a brand new replacement. They also said they'd reject the RMA if they found physical damage on my current device.\n\nNow I'm just confused if it's worth attempting an RMA because the phone seems to be working fine and the gap probably doesn't affect water resistance. Besides, there's a couple hairline scratches on the screen, hard to find, but they're there. \n\nI'm afraid the RMA might get rejected because of this and apparently the whole process may take 5-10 business days. Don't want to have to factory reset my phone and wait so long only for it to get rejected.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Does anyone here have experience RMA-ing Pixels in Germany?\n\nPictures of how the gap looks: https://imgur.com/a/GUKiaK1 (zoom in for a better look)",

    "selftext": "It's been 3 weeks since my Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold started having multiple problems. It's been 3 weeks since I've been going back an forth with Google over this phone. I bought the phone brand new about 3 months ago and it has been great until these last 3 weeks. These are my problems. \n\n1.      The SIM reader stopped reading my SIM suddenly\n\n2.      The Front screen started glitching and sometimes won’t come on\n\n3.      The phone overheats every time I use it\n\n4.      The phone doesn’t receive charge when unfolded\n\n5.      The camera app causes the phone to hang/crash\n\n6.      If restarted, the phone may not come one until after 12 hours of repeated attempts at turning it on\n\n7.      The phone just goes off on its own.\n\nAt first, Google had me send my phone to a google affiliated repair center who stated that the only problem with the phone was a small scratch and so the warranty had been removed. To fix the phone, I was given a quote for EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!!   \nI requested to have my phone returned and reached out to Google support again. This time, I was asked to take pictures of the phone and send it to the Google support again. The agent looked at the phone and stated that there were scratches to the phone's body, camera and inner screen. What he saw were left over stickies from the phone living in a Spigen body armor. \n\nI spoke to another agent who just cut the phone on me and did not call back. After speaking to 5 different Google support agents, one agent finally agreed to have me send the phone to Google's very own technicians in Warsaw Poland. Within a day, I received a report that there was a dent on the inner screen and that the warranty had been removed and to fix it, I HAD TO PAY A THIRD OF WHAT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!! No report was given with regards the 7 problems the phone had. \n\nIt's been 3 weeks since this problem started, 3 weeks without a phone, 3 weeks of putting my sim in my wife's phone just to check my notifications. 3 weeks of going around in circles with Google support. \n\nStill I haven't gotten any report about the 7 problems with the phone. Before this phone, I've been with Samsung for the past 17 years and I had no problems with their service whatsoever. Honestly I'm starting to regret leaving Samsung. \n\nAt the moment, I still do not have a phone, I'm still going back and forth with Google agents and so far, only one agent has brought up the option of a replacement and for that to occur, they have to check the warranty. \n\nPlease if you have experienced this problem or anything similar, what happens next? Will Google replace the phone? And if the answer is Yes (I hope), how long will it take. \n\nMy productivity has received a massive dent as a result of all this. I have had countless sleepless nights because of this. \n\nGoogle, please, this is not how to treat humans. This is totally unfair. ",

    "selftext": "Title says it all. My iPhone 13 mini does a solid job for a daily user. Since the iOS 26 update, it heats up like crazy, and is still very fidgety. I like my 13 Mini. It has gotten the job done since 2021. I am not a gamer, not a hardcore photographer, but do use it for audio, YouTube, and the basics. Most, if not all my apps are Google Apps, so I think the transition will be easier, but you never know. I decided to switch because of the following:\n\n* My life does not revolve around the Apple ecosystem (even though I have a Mac)\n* I use Google Apps DAILY\n* Don't give a shit about iMessage or Facetime. I actually HATE any video calls lol.\n* My 13 mini is getting old in technology and super laggy.\n* I was able to get the Pixel 10PRO 256gb for only $2 more a month, AND keep my mini. My new bill is only $64 and I could not pass this deal.\n* If I don't like the Pixel, I can return it, get my money back, and switch back to my mini.\n\nI have a feeling I am going to love the Pixel 10PRO. I am NOT anti iPhone. I am NOT anti Android. I just wanted to try Android again after 13 years. The Pixel 10 Pro fit the bill for what I was looking for. With that being said, the phone arrived today. I will setup later today and report back in a couple weeks. If anyone has some tips, tricks, or suggestions on setting up, please let me know. I have read other threads as well with PRO/ANTI iPhone/Androind content. I thought to myself, guys, it's just a phone... Thank you!",

    "title": "What To Do When Your Pixel Phone is Stuck in Fastboot Mode [Guide]",
    "selftext": "My Pixel phone got accidentally stuck in fastboot mode, and it was one of the most annoying situations one could get into, where I was stuck with a single message on screen and nothing was working. Even the Google support team was of no great help, and all my data was certain to be lost. Somehow, after a lot of sweat and tears, I was able to crack the problem by collecting little tips from various parts of the internet. As there isn't much helpful advice available, I decided to write a guide post for anyone in the future who gets stuck in a similar situation as mine.\n\n**Note - Skip to the TLDR at the end of the post if you want a simple, direct instruction on how to follow up.**\n\n# Context:\n\nMy Pixel 6a was having issues with the **Volume Down(-)** button, which either seemed to never work or work on its own all of a sudden. Initially, I didn't consider it a big issue until today, when my phone's battery died, and after rebooting, it suddenly entered the infamous Fastboot Mode (I suspect it was because the Volume Down button started acting on its own while simultaneously being pressed with the Power button).\n\nAt first, this didn't seem like a big problem until I realised what the actual mess I was in. My phone didn't seem to do anything, and I was stuck with a single message on screen like[ (this)](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-forums-api/attachment/thread-282377112-7952556128442379489.jpg). With notable information being:\n\n\\- Start message next to the power button\n\n\\- Device status: locked\n\n\\- Enter reason: vol down pressed\n\nNow there was another message next to the volume buttons, which said 'Press the volume keys to select a different menu,' but my device would literally do nothing. It wouldn't change the options when I press the volume keys. Holding the power button would do nothing. The screen would only show this single thing, and nothing would work. It won't even turn on and off. My whole phone was frozen and felt useless. I even let the battery die in the hope that when I would boot it again, everything would go back to normal, but nope, it was still the same screen.\n\n# Google's response:\n\nEventually, I called into Google's helpline to ask for assistance. The Google agent assigned to me was nice but didn't prove to be very helpful as he told me that my phone's software had crashed, from what he could understand on the call, and that I would need to get it repaired from Google's official service centre. Now the problem was that I was in my hometown on vacation, and it would take me another week to go back to the city where their centre is located. That being said, time was still not the major issue because the agent said that there was a 90% chance that all my data would get erased, and that was the dealbreaker for me, cause I didn't want to lose any of the data and memories I had saved in my phone.\n\n# What Worked For Me:\n\nI was really hopeless. But like a drowning man clutching at straws, I was ready to try any advice that might work. On the internet, there was little to no helpful advice available, until I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/s/jijM57t5Af) lifesaver of a Reddit post by u/albogaster, and while I suggest reading the full post, I found these two videos ([ Vid 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTT0_mfCgDc) &[ Vid 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqhlzvzznXM)) by the YT channel **WorldOfTech** to be the most helpful.\n\nThe two videos basically explain to you:\n\n1.[ How to Boot into Android Recovery Menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTT0_mfCgDc)\n\n2.[ How to Exit 'Waiting on Rescue Command'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqhlzvzznXM)\n\nYou can check out both of these videos for your knowledge, but I will be including the tips gathered from these videos in the **'Step-by-Step Tutorial'** section of my **TLDR.**\n\nThere's another important video mentioned in the post ([Vid 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMaoXQkKy_w)) by YT channel **HardReset(dot)Info,** which explains to you how to enter[ Recovery Mode from Fastboot Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMaoXQkKy_w) that you should check out.\n\nNow, I knew what needed to be done, but still, my problem was that **my phone was literally frozen with no buttons working,** unlike the tutorials I had seen, where they at least had the option to navigate through volume buttons. That was until I came across[ this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/11e2jho/comment/ktc4tpt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) comment by u/Forsaken\\_Youth\\_924,1, which said:\n\n\\> hold power and volume up till it vibrates and resets, then hold volume down and power while it's off and click vol up once to get to that weird core command menu and use volume to go up or down, power to select\n\nSo that's what I did, I held the Power button with the Volume Up button for a good amount of 20 seconds, and **it turned off!**\n\nYay!! At least it did something! At least it did something other than being stuck on a single screen!\n\nNow that was progress.\n\nBut it was not long until I was disappointed again, because the next step wouldn't work. Nope. Nothing. It will come back to the same screen again. Tried pressing the Power button + Vol Down button for a good amount of time while it was still off. Didn't work. Tried pressing the Power button alone. Didn't work.\n\nI suspected that it must be because my Vol Down button is not working. But what do I do now? Do I get it repaired first? Is this gonna work at all?\n\nBut then I came across[ this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/11e2jho/comment/ksm7nlj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) other comment under the same thread, which advised to hit the volume down key as hard as you can, **and... it worked!** What in the world?! I didn't even expect the solution to my problem would be this simple. Just banged the Vol Down key across the table as hard as I could, then pressed the Power + Vol Down key while the screen was still off and voila, I was able to navigate the menu using the volume buttons.\n\nNow with that working, I selected the **Recovery Mode** option which bought me to a screen that said **'No Command'** and then using the information from the above videos, I went into the Recovery Mode Menu and selected the **Reboot System option** and finally there I reclaimed my phone from the devil's claw without losing any of my data and without paying the repairing charges.\n\nThanks to both u/albogaster and u/Forsaken\\_Youth\\_9241 without whom this wouldn't have been possible.\n\nFor those who want a step-by-step tutorial, please read the TLDR next.\n\n# TLDR\n\nGot locked into Fastboot mode and here's what helped me:\n\n**The Issue:**\n\n\\- Stuck in Fastboot mode\n\n\\- Not able to navigate in Fastboot mode\n\n\\- Volume Down Key not working\n\n\\- Device state: Locked\n\n\\- Enter reason: Vol down pressed\n\n**Step-by-Step Tutorial:**\n\n**- Step 1:** **Fix the Volume Down Button (if not working):** You gotta get it repaired, or maybe try banging it across the edge of a table really hard (worked for me). I know this sounds silly but it works and it's crucial for our process.\n\n**- Step 2: Reset the Fastboot Navigation setting** **(if not working):** Press and hold the **Power Button** and **Volume Up** button simultaneously for a long time (maybe 20 seconds or more). This will turn off the screen. Now press and hold the **Power button** and **Volume Down button** together. This will **reset** the Fastboot page, and you will now be able to navigate through the volume buttons.\n\n**- Step 3: Exit Fastboot Navigation:** With the volume buttons now working, press **Volume Down** button and navigate towards the **Recovery Mode** (not rescue mode) and press **Power Button** once. A Google logo will pop up, and you'll come across a screen that says **'No Command'**. Now, hold the **Power button** and while you're holding it press the **Volume Up botton 'once’,** and you will see a **menu** pop up.\n\n**- Step 4: Reboot System:** In the menu, navigate to the **'Reboot System Now'** option using the volume keys, and while it's selected, press the **Power button** ‘**once’,** and now it'll boot your screen normally. That's it!\n\nI know this was long, but I hope it was helpful.\n\nThanks.",

    "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI have a second hand Pixel 8 Pro that I bought a month ago and it was working great until I two days ago when I installed an urgent update by Pixel (I believe it was Android 16 (Build Number: BP3A.251005.004.B1). After a day and a half I woke to find my screen flickering and twitching and randomly turning off when I check certain colours or images (I suspect dark mode or anything remotely using dark colours)\n\nHere is a video of the issue: [Screen Flickering - Pixel Pro 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFg0WO_FcLI?si=bFy31aqzQIRG29NI)\n\nI googled the issue as it didn't make sense to me that a hardware issue would cause that in such a context, I suspect it is a software issue. Here is what I tried to no avail:\n\n-Rebooting the phone, even in Safe Mode\n-Taking off the screen protector\n-Disabling \"Smooth Display\" (120hz mode) and lowering the resolution to \"high resolution\"\n-Disabling \"Adaptive Brightness\" and keeping it at 30-40%\n-Accessing the developper options and disabling \"HW Overlays\"\n\nSo as you can see, I virtually tried everything except factory reset which I don't want to do for the time being. I opt-in in the Android Beta Program to see if a Beta OTA Update would help, still waiting for one at the moment.\n\nAt this point I'm worried it is hardware issue and since I live in Morocco I can't send it to Google nor benefit from an extended replacement program that Google provides in supported countries. In worst case scenario I can order a screen replacement from iFixit and see if I can find a repairman here in the local market to install it but before resorting to such a costly course of action, I'd like to see if someone managed to fix this issue before\n\nThank you in advance",

Anker is completely sold out where I live so I was kind of set on buying a Belkin boostcharge 20k powerbank but noticed my partner's phone (google pixel 7) wasn't on the list of compatible phones.  \nI think the powerbank has a 15W port but I read that it should be 20W for this phone. Is the charge going to be too slow, or is it not too big of an issue? How much slower would it charge? Should I look for higher output powerbanks? If so I'd love some recommendations if anyone has any good powerbanks that work for them for this model.",

But the amount of issues I've had with the 9 fold is ridiculous.\n\nHere's a list in order that mine has:\n\n1. Volume down button stopped working - can't turn down the volume using this button, can't screenshot\n\n2. Quick tap has stopped working - started to get less reactive, at first if I turned it off and on, it would work for a bit then would stop. Now it doesn't react at all. Randomly it would take screenshots on its own. I just turned it off completely.\n\n3. Camera has gotten worst at detecting and adjusting for light - under certain lighting conditions, it doesn't auto adjust accurately and there will be things that look like slightly off colored stripes going horizontally.\n\n4. Phone charges only when it is closed - If I open it, plugged in or not, the battery icon turns into a grayed out empty symbol with a question mark. It doesn't charge and battery health drops from 97% to 25%, only when it's open.\n\n5. Related to 4 possibly - it's become laggy and charges slowly over the course of one day after #4 started.\n\nLuckily, Google support has put in a ticket for me to take it to a repair center and get it repaired or replaced under warranty. The issue is that I am stationed overseas so have to send it to my parent in the US to take it to the repair center (there's none authorized near me) and then send it back to me.  Looking at about 2 months without the phone. Parent isn't technically savvy so low chance they'll be able to test it out prior to sending back to me.\n\nFortunately I have my old pixel 6 in a drawer that I can use.\n\nYour turn, what problems have y'all experienced?",

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device’s screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A €500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn’t I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google’s assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can’t even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen’s problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle’s written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don’t know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I’ve been for months without my phone, and it’ll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google’s abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this! Best wishes. 🙂",

I used to use custom launchers back in the day but they seem more finicky and glitchy with newer phones. I loved Android because I could customize everything to fit my personality and now they're making us like Apple. It feels like the same pull to minimalism and sad beige aesthetic that is plaguing homes and businesses (looking at you McDonald's and Taco Bell) now a days. All personality is being sucked out. I want choices without needing a custom launcher. ",

It's a long shot, but is there any way that anyone knows of to expand the storage to support a larger Spotify playlist other than buying a newer phone with 1TB storage?

Not having much luck troubleshooting online, so if anyone has suggestions for either of these, help would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n1. No longer autocompleting Google searches. The phone asked if I wanted to sync information across devices, which I thought I'd done on my last one, so I said yes. Since agreeing to that, I no longer get autocomplete/suggested searches for Google searches (on my phone or on my laptop). When I start typing a question, all that comes up is my own previous queries. I do have the Trending Search setting turned on. I also tried turning on the personalized autocomplete setting, but all that did was start including websites I have saved to my bookmarks. I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, and restarting the phone, but nothing helps \n\n2. Discover won't go away. I've ensured the discover setting is off, but I still get an MSN-style list of news stories every time I open a new tab or spend time away from a tab (I come back to it, and the content is minimized with an option to pick back up where I left off... with an MSN-style list of stories beneath it). This one is still working correctly on my laptop (no stories shown to me there), but it's making me a bit nuts that it won't go away on the Pixel. Again here, I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, restarting the phone, to no avail.\n\nThanks again for any tips!",

Most, if not all my apps are Google Apps, so I think the transition will be easier, but you never know. I decided to switch because of the following:\n\n* My life does not revolve around the Apple ecosystem (even though I have a Mac)\n* I use Google Apps DAILY\n* Don't give a shit about iMessage or Facetime. I actually HATE any video calls lol.\n* My 13 mini is getting old in technology and super laggy.\n* I was able to get the Pixel 10PRO 256gb for only $2 more a month, AND keep my mini. My new bill is only $64 and I could not pass this deal.\n* If I don't like the Pixel, I can return it, get my money back, and switch back to my mini.\n\nI have a feeling I am going to love the Pixel 10PRO. I am NOT anti iPhone. I am NOT anti Android. I just wanted to try Android again after 13 years. The Pixel 10 Pro fit the bill for what I was looking for. With that being said, the phone arrived today. I will setup later today and report back in a couple weeks. If anyone has some tips, tricks, or suggestions on setting up, please let me know. I have read other threads as well with PRO/ANTI iPhone/Androind content. I thought to myself, guys, it's just a phone... Thank you!",

    "selftext": "So, I'm not sure yet, but this might end up being a rent post.\nI switched to Google Pixel about 4 days ago and I've never been happier. My last phone was a Nothing 2a and the ones before that were primary Xiaomi phones. I never had a feeling of finishednes and high quality in my hands before. Although the Chip and the battery aren't the best on a or specifically this foldable, I always wanted one and went all in. I love everything about it and even the noticeable grace of this foldable is rather pleasant to me, I wanted a foldable, I got one, and it only reminds me of the fact that it's foldable.\n\nNow to the rent part of this post, the camera. I'm not a camera guy at all. The years before I didn't even transport or safe my pictures before changing the phone so I lost them every time. It was nothing memorable, just pictures of things to remind me of or something.\nBut with pixel, as it was considered the best phone camera for a long time, I thought, I'd look into it. It looks well done as everything does, but why can't I have the option to just shoot raw in the full, advertised 48mp?\n\nEvery other pixel phone has the option as far as I know and even Gemini told me that it's there, even after the proof of multiple screenshots. It just sounds like a no brainer to just not included the option because, why not.\nI read things online about pixel binging and all the different stuff, but after all, let the people decide what they want after they paid about 1800€ for a brand new phone with the camera of lasts gen, which, btw. had the option to select 48mp raw.\nI won't really need it, it just noticed it and got pissed off, because when I shoot pictures, I also want raw in full quality!\n\nWhy Google, just why? It's such a small thing and yet so dumb!\n\nIf I'm missing something, please correct me!",

    "selftext": "It's been 3 weeks since my Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold started having multiple problems. It's been 3 weeks since I've been going back an forth with Google over this phone. I bought the phone brand new about 3 months ago and it has been great until these last 3 weeks. These are my problems. \n\n1.      The SIM reader stopped reading my SIM suddenly\n\n2.      The Front screen started glitching and sometimes won’t come on\n\n3.      The phone overheats every time I use it\n\n4.      The phone doesn’t receive charge when unfolded\n\n5.      The camera app causes the phone to hang/crash\n\n6.      If restarted, the phone may not come one until after 12 hours of repeated attempts at turning it on\n\n7.      The phone just goes off on its own.\n\nAt first, Google had me send my phone to a google affiliated repair center who stated that the only problem with the phone was a small scratch and so the warranty had been removed. To fix the phone, I was given a quote for EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!!   \nI requested to have my phone returned and reached out to Google support again. This time, I was asked to take pictures of the phone and send it to the Google support again. The agent looked at the phone and stated that there were scratches to the phone's body, camera and inner screen. What he saw were left over stickies from the phone living in a Spigen body armor. \n\nI spoke to another agent who just cut the phone on me and did not call back. After speaking to 5 different Google support agents, one agent finally agreed to have me send the phone to Google's very own technicians in Warsaw Poland. Within a day, I received a report that there was a dent on the inner screen and that the warranty had been removed and to fix it, I HAD TO PAY A THIRD OF WHAT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!! No report was given with regards the 7 problems the phone had. \n\nIt's been 3 weeks since this problem started, 3 weeks without a phone, 3 weeks of putting my sim in my wife's phone just to check my notifications. 3 weeks of going around in circles with Google support. \n\nStill I haven't gotten any report about the 7 problems with the phone. Before this phone, I've been with Samsung for the past 17 years and I had no problems with their service whatsoever. Honestly I'm starting to regret leaving Samsung. \n\nAt the moment, I still do not have a phone, I'm still going back and forth with Google agents and so far, only one agent has brought up the option of a replacement and for that to occur, they have to check the warranty. \n\nPlease if you have experienced this problem or anything similar, what happens next? Will Google replace the phone? And if the answer is Yes (I hope), how long will it take. \n\nMy productivity has received a massive dent as a result of all this. I have had countless sleepless nights because of this. \n\nGoogle, please, this is not how to treat humans. This is totally unfair. ",

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device’s screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A €500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn’t I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google’s assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can’t even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen’s problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle’s written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don’t know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I’ve been for months without my phone, and it’ll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google’s abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this! Best wishes. 🙂",

After the update, it seems to have completely disappeared.\n\nI've already checked the Phone app settings (`Phone > Settings > Spam & Call Screen`), but the options are gone.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Does anyone know a fix or a way to restore it? I'm in Germany (in case it's a regional thing).\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

Not having much luck troubleshooting online, so if anyone has suggestions for either of these, help would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n1. No longer autocompleting Google searches. The phone asked if I wanted to sync information across devices, which I thought I'd done on my last one, so I said yes. Since agreeing to that, I no longer get autocomplete/suggested searches for Google searches (on my phone or on my laptop). When I start typing a question, all that comes up is my own previous queries. I do have the Trending Search setting turned on. I also tried turning on the personalized autocomplete setting, but all that did was start including websites I have saved to my bookmarks. I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, and restarting the phone, but nothing helps \n\n2. Discover won't go away. I've ensured the discover setting is off, but I still get an MSN-style list of news stories every time I open a new tab or spend time away from a tab (I come back to it, and the content is minimized with an option to pick back up where I left off... with an MSN-style list of stories beneath it). This one is still working correctly on my laptop (no stories shown to me there), but it's making me a bit nuts that it won't go away on the Pixel. Again here, I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, restarting the phone, to no avail.\n\nThanks again for any tips!",

    "selftext": "Upgrading from a Note 10+ (loved the phone but half the screen no longer reacts to touch, only s pen unfortunately) decided to trial run both the s24 ultra (1TB) & S25+ (512GB) before finalizing which to keep, the other goes back. Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "title": "My long-term experience with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra (and why I still love it)",
    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Samsung did a lot of good with this phone. Like a lot. They made the cover screen a lot better than what it used to be, and I can do and see a lot more because of that. They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "title": "My long-term experience with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra (and why I still love it)",
    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Hello redditors!\n\nI have previously asked in this community if it's worth purchasing the Galaxy Watch 4 LTE 44mm refurbished for around 80$, and most people said I should I go search for an another model at around the same price. So while looking today, I found a lot of Galaxy Watch 7 40mm LTE listings for around 100$ - 120$. My question is if it's worth getting it for that price? One seller even said it's almost brand new, and it's been used for only 5 days, another said it's been rarely used. And for the price tag, plus the LTE feature, and being a relatively new flagship model (last year is was a flagship watch), I think it's worth to go for it. What do you guys think? Or should I get it, or should I go for Watch 6, 5, or an older model?\n\nMy question is if it's worth getting the Watch 7 LTE 40mm for this price tag? Is the battery relatively good, especially with LTE ON? Or does the Galaxy Watch 4 44mm or other older watches perform better? What about the experience, is it lag-free, what sensors does it have compared to older models, and why should I get it over an older model? And will it be any difference if using it with a Galaxy phone or not? And, jumping from a Galaxy Fit 3 to this watch would be a major difference? And if anything, how much does a battery swap cost?\n\nThanks in advance for helping me out!\n\n  \nEDIT 1: I forgot to mention, does this watch have comfortable straps and a comfortable design compared to older models?",

I\n\nIt is not necessary that size is the same as ultra, I would just like the best experience on Android as I am still deciding on staying on Android or returning to iOS, so far the Z Fold 7 is really amazing and I am really considering staying on Android for the first time since Galaxy S6.\n\nI am more of a tech guy as a sports guy but I do sports as a hobby.\n\nThanks!",

Long story short, i receive an email today, pretty vague, saying that the watch is not repairable, so they will refund my purchase. I have a Fit 3, but i really got used to all the premium features of the Ultra and the relatively decent battery life. A new 2025 Ultra is almost $700 with tax.

    "selftext": "Hello redditors!\n\nI have previously asked in this community if it's worth purchasing the Galaxy Watch 4 LTE 44mm refurbished for around 80$, and most people said I should I go search for an another model at around the same price. So while looking today, I found a lot of Galaxy Watch 7 40mm LTE listings for around 100$ - 120$. My question is if it's worth getting it for that price? One seller even said it's almost brand new, and it's been used for only 5 days, another said it's been rarely used. And for the price tag, plus the LTE feature, and being a relatively new flagship model (last year is was a flagship watch), I think it's worth to go for it. What do you guys think? Or should I get it, or should I go for Watch 6, 5, or an older model?\n\nMy question is if it's worth getting the Watch 7 LTE 40mm for this price tag? Is the battery relatively good, especially with LTE ON? Or does the Galaxy Watch 4 44mm or other older watches perform better? What about the experience, is it lag-free, what sensors does it have compared to older models, and why should I get it over an older model? And will it be any difference if using it with a Galaxy phone or not? And, jumping from a Galaxy Fit 3 to this watch would be a major difference? And if anything, how much does a battery swap cost?\n\nThanks in advance for helping me out!\n\n  \nEDIT 1: I forgot to mention, does this watch have comfortable straps and a comfortable design compared to older models?",

Sure enough, I call again, some support person tells me that I will be contacted within 24 - 72 hours by someone to discuss my options. Long story short, i receive an email today, pretty vague, saying that the watch is not repairable, so they will refund my purchase. I have a Fit 3, but i really got used to all the premium features of the Ultra and the relatively decent battery life. A new 2025 Ultra is almost $700 with tax. I have no idea what was wrong with my watch and now I'm terrified that it might happen again.",

    "selftext": "Just ran my first HM today (hooray) but wanted to discuss the GPS function of the Galaxy Watch 7. About halfway the race my watch was already off by 600m (!!) with the actual markers. At the end of the race it measured 22.3km, so basically 1.2km extra. I'm not sure if there is a big diffetence in taking the inside vs outside curve while running, but if you take a look at below screenshot it seems clear to me what the issue is. Recorded via samsung health. Any tips on how to improve or is the answer go Garmin?",

    "title": "Galaxy Watch 7 Second Hand - Worth it?",
    "selftext": "Hello redditors!\n\nI have previously asked in this community if it's worth purchasing the Galaxy Watch 4 LTE 44mm refurbished for around 80$, and most people said I should I go search for an another model at around the same price. So while looking today, I found a lot of Galaxy Watch 7 40mm LTE listings for around 100$ - 120$. My question is if it's worth getting it for that price? One seller even said it's almost brand new, and it's been used for only 5 days, another said it's been rarely used. And for the price tag, plus the LTE feature, and being a relatively new flagship model (last year is was a flagship watch), I think it's worth to go for it. What do you guys think? Or should I get it, or should I go for Watch 6, 5, or an older model?\n\nMy question is if it's worth getting the Watch 7 LTE 40mm for this price tag? Is the battery relatively good, especially with LTE ON? Or does the Galaxy Watch 4 44mm or other older watches perform better? What about the experience, is it lag-free, what sensors does it have compared to older models, and why should I get it over an older model? And will it be any difference if using it with a Galaxy phone or not? And, jumping from a Galaxy Fit 3 to this watch would be a major difference? And if anything, how much does a battery swap cost?\n\nThanks in advance for helping me out!\n\n  \nEDIT 1: I forgot to mention, does this watch have comfortable straps and a comfortable design compared to older models?",

I also want a laptop that will hold up well and not be outdated the moment I open the box.\n\nThe biggest issue I'm having is finding what looks to be a good laptop for a good price on Amazon, only for it to have several 1-star reviews, saying it blue-screened shortly after purchase. I also find laptops that I am unable to find/build on the manufacturers website, which makes me think that it's either outdated or crap.\n\nI'm not looking to spend a ton of money, so I'd like to find a reliable laptop for perhaps around $600, but can go higher if I'd be getting a great machine for the price. I also know Black Friday is a month away, so I can wait for price drops, if necessary. \n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hi, I'm looking to buy a Laptop rn. \n\nThis laptop is within my budget of 600-750$\n\nI want to use the laptop so I can composite 2d animation on after effects, so lighting and shadow, motion blurs, camera movements, color grading, blending modes etc. (1080 x 1920)\n\nIt says everywhere that 32gb of ram is recommended for after effects, and that 16 is basically the minimum, so thats why i was drawn to this laptop.\n\nIve heard that lenovo for the most part is pretty reliable however, what's confusing me is the listing itself. The description says that its a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3, and this product exists on their website, but not with these specs. That being said it shows as being sold from a 3rd party comoany called Surwin Tech which has mostly positive ratings on Amazon. \n\nIs this laptop suitable for my needs? Should I look elsewhere? Any recs for my budget?\n\nAlso my friend is currently lending me his 2020 M1 MacBook Pro with 8GB of Memory.. should i just stick with this?",

    "selftext": "OK, here we go. I know I will get several opinions, but after doing tons of research, getting chatGPT's help, and reading one Reddit thread after another I am thoroughly confused. I currently have an Asus Zenbook Pro 15 Flib OLED. I've had it just 2 months shy of 3 years now and end of last month it started intermittently booting straight into UEFI (BIOS). The keyboard is also giving me problems (some keys not working unless I push down hard), I lose my screen for a few seconds when I plug it in while it's running, and it won't charge on one of the outlets in our house (everything else works fine on that outlet).\n\nGeek squad wants $149.99 for just a diagnostic or $179.99 for a one-year membership, but can't tell me if I would need to buy parts without doing the diagnostic. Given all of the issues, and the fact that I have had it almost 3 years, I started looking at laptops and have landed on this one (possibly):  \nLenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 2025 Copilot+ PC with Intel Core Ultra 7 256V Processor, 1TB SSD, Yoga Pen, 14” WUXGA OLED Dolby Vision® Touchscreen, 16GB LPDDR5x-8533 Memory, 5MP IR Cam, Wi-Fi 7, and Win11 Pro  \n[https://a.co/d/gamnGK4](https://a.co/d/gamnGK4)\n\nI was just about to order this one when I decided to read another Reddit thread on this very model from 10 months ago, and one person said it's not great for Zoom b/c the audio is horrible and the video quality is not good. Another person said it \"screams,\" meaning the fan is really loud.\n\nWell, I run three 2-hour Zoom meetings every week, plus additional 1 hour meetings depending on what I have going on. In addition, I mostly use my laptop to create basic canva designs for IG and FB posts, minimal video editing, basic Google drive/Gmail functions, Zoom meetings, Zapier, Thrivecart, etc. My current Asus has been perfect for my needs. Battery life is important.\n\nWould love some suggestions. Ideally, I would like to spend no more than $1,200. Some questions:  \n1. How important is OLED?\n\n2. Seems 16GB is sufficient for what I do or should I go with 32 GB?\n\n3. Processor recommendations?\n\nThank you,\n\nK",

She was hoping to trade this one in, but obviously she isn’t going to get much in trade-in value for a laptop with a broken hinge.\n\nI was wondering if there’s any way I can fix this myself or how difficult of a fix it would be.

And whenever I try to run certain games the temps go unnecessarily high, like for Undertale, hollow knight, Steamworld dig.\nWhen plugged in the temps usually jump back and forth between 60 - 68°c, but on battery they can go as low as 50°c (idle temps are at 46°c)\n\n(For the record my laptops temps are fine otherwise, so I don't think any cooling issues are there. And I know 65 is not a high enough temp to worry about but this just bothers me why this is a thing)\n\nI know CPUs utilize more power when plugged in but here's the weird part\nthis doesn't happen for games that are obviously more demanding like Outlast they stay around 55°c when plugged in.\n\nAnd for a game like steamworld dig or undertale that barely requires the CPU to do something, going to the 60s is very confusing to me. What's really annoying is that when I first booted Steamworld dig today the temps hovered around 52°c which made sense but then on my second time running it the temps are now at 67°c (I remember the same thing happening with hollow knight).\n\nI like using my laptop plugged in a lot so usually I'll prefer to play plugged in too, so this gets very annoying when I can feel the CPU warming up under my hand for no reason.\n\nSo yeah this probably sounds like a ramblings of a madman but please, make it make sense 🥺.",

Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** 2.500 euros\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** No, can't find much here where I live\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Same as a MacBook Pro M1 Pro - great construction quality, similar battery life when not doing work tasks (writing docs, light media, etc.). For gaming, I would only do it plugged.\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Same weight and thinness as a MacBook Pro M1 Pro. Do not need something paper thin, but don't want also a +6kg pc.\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 13-14'\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run**: Want to play games with it when plugged. Outside that - fast and smooth experience when doing media, work tasks like writing docs, light weight coding / vibe coding. Basically my current experience with my work MacBook Pro M1 Pro, but that can also game in Windows.\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 60Fps and at least 1080p is a must have. I'm using an Xbox Series X for more intensive games, but if I can play for example Oblivion Remastered well enough in 1080p 60fps with mods I'm more than happy. But it will be for indie/multiplayer pc exclusive games (mmorpgs, Mobas, etc...)\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Good keyboard is a must - something akin to what the MacBook Pro m1 offers. Not the best, but it is good enough for a solid experience. When gaming at home I will connect external screens (at least 2) and external keyboard. min 512gb ssd + 16/32 gb ram. If possible, 2k120hz screen, don't need 4k. reliable build quality for sure, after using this MacBook, I really care about a pc that won't explode by itself after a few years of use. At least +2 Usb C Ports, HDMI and a headphone jack\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** this is to be my daily driver - to work outside my main job and that can game whenever im missing something on xbox Series X or Switch.",

    "selftext": "Hi Reddit, my Lenovo IdeaPad charger has had issues for a while. It will stop working and usually doing a power reset on the laptop fixes things. That's stopped working and the laptop is on it's way downhill anyway so I don't want to invest in an original charger. I suppose this is possibly a laptop rather than charger issue but I do have two other chargers I'd like to try. Both inputs would work for charging.\n\nOption 1 is a Dell laptop charger. Option 2 is a Lenovo laptop charger for another model. I don't know which is better or at least which won't kill the laptop - I think the concern would be based on the output wattage but I'm wondering about the brand matching as well.\n\nOption 1: 65W\nOption 2: 45W\nOriginal: 65W\n\nAny insight is much appreciated!",

This night I was playing some games with my friends and I noticed a faint burning smell and it was driving me crazy cause no one else in my house could smell it but me (idk why) but then I checked my computer cord and unplugged it and the plug with the metal bit was burnt , the blue tip at the end was almost completely gone , the whole metal part was bent and had charring and what I think to be black plastic from the computer it self melting? And then the plastic part of the plug was white almost in the appearance of cooled down hot glue (idk why ) and I was really concerned. I then inspected the port itself and the port is also melted and warped a bit and on the inside it seems as if there is either some sort of fuzz or melted plastic or metal on the inside. I’m super bummed cause I’ve basically survived all of my teen years and young adult life with this and this is my only access to my current job and all of my games, digital art and music projects . Any help or guidance on what is happening and what I can or can’t do is greatly appreciated and sorry for any grammar mistakes I’m on phone and also stressed lol",

And whenever I try to run certain games the temps go unnecessarily high, like for Undertale, hollow knight, Steamworld dig.\nWhen plugged in the temps usually jump back and forth between 60 - 68°c, but on battery they can go as low as 50°c (idle temps are at 46°c)\n\n(For the record my laptops temps are fine otherwise, so I don't think any cooling issues are there. And I know 65 is not a high enough temp to worry about but this just bothers me why this is a thing)\n\nI know CPUs utilize more power when plugged in but here's the weird part\nthis doesn't happen for games that are obviously more demanding like Outlast they stay around 55°c when plugged in.\n\nAnd for a game like steamworld dig or undertale that barely requires the CPU to do something, going to the 60s is very confusing to me. What's really annoying is that when I first booted Steamworld dig today the temps hovered around 52°c which made sense but then on my second time running it the temps are now at 67°c (I remember the same thing happening with hollow knight).\n\nI like using my laptop plugged in a lot so usually I'll prefer to play plugged in too, so this gets very annoying when I can feel the CPU warming up under my hand for no reason.\n\nSo yeah this probably sounds like a ramblings of a madman but please, make it make sense 🥺.",

    "selftext": "I'm looking to purchase a new laptop, but I'm having trouble settling on a specific one. The basic options I would prefer would be a minimum of 32gb RAM and 1tb of storage. I'm also looking for a Ryzen processor, but am open to suggestions if there's something better. I'm not planning on doing any serious gaming or streaming, but do do video editing. I also want a laptop that will hold up well and not be outdated the moment I open the box.\n\nThe biggest issue I'm having is finding what looks to be a good laptop for a good price on Amazon, only for it to have several 1-star reviews, saying it blue-screened shortly after purchase. I also find laptops that I am unable to find/build on the manufacturers website, which makes me think that it's either outdated or crap.\n\nI'm not looking to spend a ton of money, so I'd like to find a reliable laptop for perhaps around $600, but can go higher if I'd be getting a great machine for the price. I also know Black Friday is a month away, so I can wait for price drops, if necessary. \n\nThanks in advance!",

The description says that its a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3, and this product exists on their website, but not with these specs. That being said it shows as being sold from a 3rd party comoany called Surwin Tech which has mostly positive ratings on Amazon. \n\nIs this laptop suitable for my needs? Should I look elsewhere? Any recs for my budget?\n\nAlso my friend is currently lending me his 2020 M1 MacBook Pro with 8GB of Memory.. should i just stick with this?",

He says the dual screen feature is incredible for him but that he is worried about the laptops design a little. For example, he is a bit scared about the hinge eventually being compromised, the quality of the keyboard etc. I love the design but it is a little unique and I can kind of understand his concern. \n\nWhat are your opinions about this laptop, especially those who own it already?",

I currently have an Asus Zenbook Pro 15 Flib OLED. I've had it just 2 months shy of 3 years now and end of last month it started intermittently booting straight into UEFI (BIOS). The keyboard is also giving me problems (some keys not working unless I push down hard), I lose my screen for a few seconds when I plug it in while it's running, and it won't charge on one of the outlets in our house (everything else works fine on that outlet).\n\nGeek squad wants $149.99 for just a diagnostic or $179.99 for a one-year membership, but can't tell me if I would need to buy parts without doing the diagnostic. Given all of the issues, and the fact that I have had it almost 3 years, I started looking at laptops and have landed on this one (possibly):  \nLenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 2025 Copilot+ PC with Intel Core Ultra 7 256V Processor, 1TB SSD, Yoga Pen, 14” WUXGA OLED Dolby Vision® Touchscreen, 16GB LPDDR5x-8533 Memory, 5MP IR Cam, Wi-Fi 7, and Win11 Pro  \n[https://a.co/d/gamnGK4](https://a.co/d/gamnGK4)\n\nI was just about to order this one when I decided to read another Reddit thread on this very model from 10 months ago, and one person said it's not great for Zoom b/c the audio is horrible and the video quality is not good. Another person said it \"screams,\" meaning the fan is really loud.\n\nWell, I run three 2-hour Zoom meetings every week, plus additional 1 hour meetings depending on what I have going on. In addition, I mostly use my laptop to create basic canva designs for IG and FB posts, minimal video editing, basic Google drive/Gmail functions, Zoom meetings, Zapier, Thrivecart, etc. My current Asus has been perfect for my needs. Battery life is important.\n\nWould love some suggestions. Ideally, I would like to spend no more than $1,200. Some questions:  \n1. How important is OLED?\n\n2. Seems 16GB is sufficient for what I do or should I go with 32 GB?\n\n3. Processor recommendations?\n\nThank you,\n\nK",

This night I was playing some games with my friends and I noticed a faint burning smell and it was driving me crazy cause no one else in my house could smell it but me (idk why) but then I checked my computer cord and unplugged it and the plug with the metal bit was burnt , the blue tip at the end was almost completely gone , the whole metal part was bent and had charring and what I think to be black plastic from the computer it self melting? And then the plastic part of the plug was white almost in the appearance of cooled down hot glue (idk why ) and I was really concerned. I then inspected the port itself and the port is also melted and warped a bit and on the inside it seems as if there is either some sort of fuzz or melted plastic or metal on the inside. I’m super bummed cause I’ve basically survived all of my teen years and young adult life with this and this is my only access to my current job and all of my games, digital art and music projects . Any help or guidance on what is happening and what I can or can’t do is greatly appreciated and sorry for any grammar mistakes I’m on phone and also stressed lol",

    "title": "Weird temp levels while gaming plugged in.",
    "selftext": "So I've noticed something really weird on my laptop, it's an intel core i5 1335U with 8gb of ram, no GPU. And whenever I try to run certain games the temps go unnecessarily high, like for Undertale, hollow knight, Steamworld dig.\nWhen plugged in the temps usually jump back and forth between 60 - 68°c, but on battery they can go as low as 50°c (idle temps are at 46°c)\n\n(For the record my laptops temps are fine otherwise, so I don't think any cooling issues are there. And I know 65 is not a high enough temp to worry about but this just bothers me why this is a thing)\n\nI know CPUs utilize more power when plugged in but here's the weird part\nthis doesn't happen for games that are obviously more demanding like Outlast they stay around 55°c when plugged in.\n\nAnd for a game like steamworld dig or undertale that barely requires the CPU to do something, going to the 60s is very confusing to me. What's really annoying is that when I first booted Steamworld dig today the temps hovered around 52°c which made sense but then on my second time running it the temps are now at 67°c (I remember the same thing happening with hollow knight).\n\nI like using my laptop plugged in a lot so usually I'll prefer to play plugged in too, so this gets very annoying when I can feel the CPU warming up under my hand for no reason.\n\nSo yeah this probably sounds like a ramblings of a madman but please, make it make sense 🥺.",

I'm also looking for a Ryzen processor, but am open to suggestions if there's something better. I'm not planning on doing any serious gaming or streaming, but do do video editing. I also want a laptop that will hold up well and not be outdated the moment I open the box.\n\nThe biggest issue I'm having is finding what looks to be a good laptop for a good price on Amazon, only for it to have several 1-star reviews, saying it blue-screened shortly after purchase. I also find laptops that I am unable to find/build on the manufacturers website, which makes me think that it's either outdated or crap.\n\nI'm not looking to spend a ton of money, so I'd like to find a reliable laptop for perhaps around $600, but can go higher if I'd be getting a great machine for the price. I also know Black Friday is a month away, so I can wait for price drops, if necessary. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Websites like trustpilot give it good reviews but something still makes me not trust it.",

My previous one was a Elementum E2 (which seems to be around 350W).\n\nAnyways, so I replaced the PSU and tried to turn it on, but it immediately shut down after turning the fan for one second. I thought I did something wrong, I disconnected and whatnot and noticed that it does run, but shows a blackscreen when I disconnect the CPU cable to the motherboard.\n\n(Note the PSU gives an 8 pin, but the motherboard is only a 4-pin, this is the case with both PSU's).\n\nSo I tried my old psu again and it started up without an issue.\n\nI assume I got a faulty PSU. But could it possible be that the RM1000E is incompatible with my motherboard?\n\nThank you either way. ",

My boyfriend has a 5+ year old Logitech keyboard (not sure which one sorry) and has a Logitech mouse and headset. Ideally, I’d like to be replacing all three. Mouse and headset I feel competent enough in buying (recs are welcome though) but I’m lost on keyboards. His is a full size I believe.

I did a hard reset, opened BIOS, and got a message that it had crashed with 3 options (I can't remember exactly but it was like enter bios, reset bios and boot, or reset bios and reboot), so I chose to enter BIOS again and tried resetting the memory speed from 3200 (I read this was my max for my CPU(?)) to AUTO. \n  \nAfter saving and restarting, I once again got a black screen.

The drive doesn’t show up in BIOS or Windows. At first I thought it might be a bad slot or a bad drive, but here’s what I’ve done so far:  \nTried the NV3 in both M.2 slots on the board  \nUpdated the BIOS to the latest version  \nSet PCIe mode in BIOS to Gen3 (since B450 only supports PCIe 3.0)\n\n Verified in Windows Disk Management (not showing up at all)\n\nReseated the drive, cleared CMOS, tested with/without other SATA drives\n\nTo rule out hardware failure, I tested another NVMe (GoodRAM PX600) in the same slot — it works perfectly. I also tested the Kingston NV3 in a different PC with a newer B850 chipset — and it works fine there too.\n\nSo the drive itself is good, the slot is good, but the NV3 and my B450 just don’t seem to play nicely together.  But how is this possible? What can I do?\n\nAt this point I’m thinking the NV3 just isn’t compatible with my board, even though in theory it should downshift to PCIe 3.0, but then how the PX600 is working ( it was smooth from the start)\n\n***TL:DR:*** Kingston NV3 NVMe works fine in newer systems but won’t show up at all on my B450 board. Tried BIOS update, reseating, Gen3 mode, CMOS reset, etc. Other NVMe drives work in the slot",

I've heard that there are problems with ASRock boards and the 9800x3d, I have a 7800x3d, are there any problems with that CPU? my GPU is a 9070 xt if that matters. The main purpose of my PC will be gaming and it's an all white build? Do you think these are good options, or should I go for a different motherboard?",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI just bought all the parts to make a new gaming pc two days ago and the build process went well, however now that it’s time to install the OS I’m noticing some very strange behaviours that I haven’t seen in a pc before.\n\nFirst of all, when I try to boot to the bios, there’s probably around a 40% chance that the computer will actually make it to the bios, the rest of the time it just sits with no display indefinitely. Then once I’m in the bios there’s a pretty good chance it will just freeze, making me restart and try my luck again. If I have my keyboard and mouse plugged in, I will almost always get no display, so I have to unplug them every time I turn the PC on.\n\nIve tried updating the bios as well, however every single time I tried, the update failed immediately, and then froze the computer.\n\nNext, the bootable installer. I’m not entirely sure why but this computer straight up refuses to install Windows. With the usb installer inserted and my mouse and keyboard pulled out, there’s about a 1 in 30 chance of the installer actually booting, otherwise I’m just looking at a monitor with no display.\n\nOnce I’m in the installer, every single time it will give me a blue screen, saying that my PC needs to be repaired. It says “The operating system can’t be loaded because a critical system driver is missing or contains errors”\n\nI do not believe this to be the case, as I’ve mounted the iso on 4 different USBs using both the Windows media creator app and Rufus and nothing has changed. I’ve also reset the cmos battery probably 10 times, and reseated the ram more times than I can count (I’ve only got 1 stick in there too). I’ve taken the GPU out as well. I’ve triple checked all the power connections, and everything is snug.\n\nI am suspecting there is an issue with the motherboard since it does not boot into the bios every time I turn it on.\n\nI’ve spent 12+ hours trying to get this stupid computer working, so if anybody has some advice or insight it would be greatly appreciated!",

    "selftext": "My current computer is \\~12.5 year old PC with an Intel i7-4770k, an Asus Z87-Pro LGA 1150, Geforce GTX 770, SATA III SSD, and max capacity 32 GB of DDR3 RAM. I built it when the parts were first released. As you can see, I generally go for a computer that is \"future-proof\".\n\nAnyways, it's finally time to upgrade my PC after over 12 years of dedicated service and I'd like some advice on RAM selection and anything else I might be missing. My parts so far are:\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 9800x3d\n* ASUS X870E-Creator ProArt motherboard\n* MSI MAG Coreliquid A13 360 Black - AIO ARGB Liquid Cooling - 360mm Radiator\n* 4TB WD Black SN8100 PCIe 5.0x4 NVME M.2 SSD\n* Seasonic Vertex GX-1000 80+ Gold, Nvidia RTX 40 Super/50 compatible\n* G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB Series 64GB (2 x 32GB) DDR5 6000 (PC5 48000) F5-6000J3040G32GX2-TZ5NR\n* NVIDIA Geforce RTX 3070 <-- free hand-me-down\n\nI chose the 9800x3d over the 9950x3d because I have some CPU-bound games that I play that in theory perform better with higher single core clock speed. My plan is to replace the PSU and GPU once prices come down on GPUs. Is this a good idea? Is my selected 1000W PSU too much for now if I plan to upgrade it later anyways? What if I just buy a 4080 or maybe a 5080 in a year or so?\n\nAlso, I'm starting to doubt that 2 x 32 GB DDR5 6000 is enough. I bought the maximum sized modules when I built in my PC in 2013, and now I'm thinking I might want to get 2 x 64GB now since my board support 256 GB. Thoughts? Am I being stupid? Is there anything here I'm missing or haven't considered?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I hope I’m posting this to the right sub.\n\nSo I’ve only been using one 1Tb NVME drive for the PC I edit photos and game on, but I’ve been finding 1Tb to be pretty limiting.  I just managed to snag a 2Tb Samsung 9100 Pro with heatsink listed for a like a third of what it normally goes for (it was probably a pricing error, but it did still deliver) and I wanted to get your input for the best way to make use of it.  Basically between this new gen 5 NVME and my current (gen 4) 1Tb WD Black SN850X NVME drive, which drive would it be best to put my OS, general use programs, editing software/games, or raw files I’m working with on?\n\nI’ve been encountering conflicting advice, with some people saying that you always want to have your OS and software on the fastest drive, and others saying that Windows and most software can’t actually make use of the increased speeds of gen 5 drives over gen 4 drives, but that it will be much faster to load and edit photos if the RAW image files and Photoshop/Lightroom edit files are on the gen 5 drive.\n\nI’m going to put my computer’s specs in a comment in case they’re relevant, but I will note that my motherboard (Gigabyte B650 Eagle AX) only has one gen 5 M.2 slot, so the new 2Tb drive will have to go in it’s first slot.  Also I’m not planning to just leave all my photos on either of these drives.  I’ve got two separate backups of my 2.5ish terabytes of photos on external HDDs in case something ever goes wrong with one of them.  What I’ve been doing is downloading whatever images I want to use/work with at the time to my desktop as I need, then clearing them after finishing with them and making sure I’ve backed em up to both drives, never really keeping more than maybe 300 gigabytes of photos actually on my computer at any given time. \n\n(One last thing, half the time when I’ve asked a storage related question on Reddit most comments just gloss over the question, going on about the 3-2-1 backup strategy instead.  Please don’t do that.  I’m fully aware of it and may go for it eventually, but it’s not what I’m trying to get help with RN)",

I can't seem to turn it down at all. I can modify the fan speeds in afterburner which changes the other two fans (they appear to be on the same channel) but nothing happens for the last one. Thermals are very low so it's not overheating. I've updated the firmware through GeForce experience with no change. Booting into the bios illecits the same behavior so most likely not malware. I removed the graphics card and found that none of the fan connectors were loose. Any advice is welcome.\n\nTLDR: 1 of 3 RTX 3080 fans stuck at 100% and I can't find out why",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\n\n\nI’ve got my old PC mounted on a custom metal frame (on drawer slides) built inside a hanging cabinet. The setup has served me well for years, but it’s starting to show its age.\n\n\n\nCurrent specs:\n\nCPU: Intel i7-8700K\n\nRAM: 16 GB DDR4\n\nGPU: ASUS GTX 1060 ( just 3 GB :) )\n\nAsus mATX board\n\n\n\nNow I’ve decided to start upgrading, beginning with the GPU as it could have the biggest effect. I’ve ordered an ASUS Prime RTX 5070 Ti, but I’ve run into a problem with space. \n\n\n\nMy current GTX 1060 is just 242 mm (9.5”) long, which fits perfectly with the cabinet door closed.\n\nHowever, the new RTX 5070 Ti is 304 mm (12”) long (I haven't seen any shorter version in my region), and it doesn’t fit in the same slot — the door can’t close.\n\n\n\nYou can see the measurements in the photo (attached).\n\n\n\nI see an option to use a riser cable (never used any of these) and mount the GPU underneath the metal frame, on the cabinet ceiling with a longer riser cable, or maybe even try to mount the GPU somehow vertically on the vertical part of the frame.\n\n\n\nAny ideas for mounting the longer GPU?\n\n\n\nP.s. The intake fan is on the bottom (with a filter), and on the side is an exhaust fan (no filter).\n\n  \n[https://imgur.com/a/V0y1fc4](https://imgur.com/a/V0y1fc4)",

I turned it off to go do some stuff done and when I came back there was significant audio and visual stuttering and artifacts appearing on screen. Shortly after I struggled to get the monitors to turn on at all, but the audio was working fine. After I got the screens working again, the computer would crash if I opened anything other than a browser. I attempted to update the drivers and it didn't resolve the issue, so I used a DDU and un-installed the drivers. On the first reboot after doing this, the PC worked fine again but if I restarted the computer the issues returned. I then reset the entire system and cleaned the drive. For a few restarts the computer worked fine again, but the issue inevitably returned.\n\nI am out of ideas of what to do and unsure of whether it is a hardware or a software issue. I'm about to the point of returning all parts and ordering them again. Any advice or ideas anyone can share? Thank you in advance for your help!",

    "selftext": "Hey redditors!\n\n  \nIf you're looking for someone's experience on bringing their PC to an international flight, mine might be heplful.\n\nI took my PC on a 3 hour flight with me, and was initially very scared. After watching many tutorials, I settled upon taking the GPU out and entirely filling the interior of the PC with clothes. I've seen people fill it with expandable foam, which is a better option but is way more expensive than just my clothes, that I'll be taking with me anyway. I then wrapped the PC in about 3-4 layers of bubble wrap to keep it from moving. As for the box, anything with enough cushioning should work fine. Use the original PC case box if you still have it, but pretty sure your PC will hardly fit in it anymore because of the bubble wrap, but that box was supposed to handle your empty case, not your built pc. My initial plan was a suitcase, but only go with that if its a hard-shell, but still give a lot of cushioning because the airport staff might reject to label it as \"FRAGILE\" and the airport handlers really don't care about our luggage. Finally, I bought a corrugated box that was pretty tough and in it, surrounded the pc from all 6 sides by foam/clothes. I was travelling with family so had no issue as for the amount of clothes, but you can buy normal foam as well, just make sure it wont start dropping pieces of it when moved around (happens with certain types of foam). I then taped the box as well as I could (almost spent an entire roll) and even sat on it to confirm its rigidity. As for the GPU, I took a rigid box I got with my headphones and after bubble wrapping the GPU, I put it in the box, surrounded by foam as well. I could not find static bag so had to use bubble wrap, but if you manage to find a static bag, often in the original packing of the GPU, use that before bubble wrapping. At the airport, the security officers thankfully did not suspect a thing and I passed security. Before getting the boarding pass and checking in the bag, I told them to label the bag as \"FRAGILE\" and they did so in front of me. But I'm not really sure how much that helped since the side the \"FRAGILE\" was written on is almost everytime not the one facing you. I'm pretty sure the handlers ignored it too. When I reached my home and opened the box, I could see everything in the same condition as I had left it, which was a huge relief. Then I opened the side glass, took out all my clothes, installed the GPU (which arrived in perfect condition too) and powered on the PC. \n\nAnd that's how I successfully brought my PC with me on a flight.",

I'm still torn over the choice of motherboard, especially regarding the specs B650/B650e/B860, etc.\n\nI've currently picked out two boards that might be suitable for me (feel free to write your recommendations as well, price up to about €200). They are the ASUS ROG STRIX B650E-F GAMING WIFI and the GIGABYTE B850 Gaming X WIFI6E.\n\nMy questions now:\n\n* Are these boards sufficient for my specs?\n* Are these boards future-proof (upgrade options)?\n* Is there a difference between the B850 and the B650e chipset?\n\nI’m looking forward to your answers! :)",

While I am a pretty heavy gamer myself I have an Acer Predator so I don’t have the need for a keyboard and don’t know too much about them. My boyfriend has a 5+ year old Logitech keyboard (not sure which one sorry) and has a Logitech mouse and headset. Ideally, I’d like to be replacing all three. Mouse and headset I feel competent enough in buying (recs are welcome though) but I’m lost on keyboards. His is a full size I believe. Any recommendations (preferably something I could buy in-store in Aus but I’m happy to order in) for keyboards under the $500 range? I’m happy to splurge I just want to make sure I can afford it before his birthday in a couple weeks. Thanks! ",

Some graphic design and photo and video editing, which I needed a stronger setup. But now I'm not doing that kind of work anymore, I wanted to go back to AMD due to its value and not worrying about the constant upgrading that Intel does. Plus to save on my energy bill.  \n\nWhat would be a comparative AMD system that would be in the Intel i7 range?  I don't game, and don't do heavy video editing.\n\nPresently, I'm running an i9 14900K.  (I don't need that kind of horsepower anymore - but Micro Center had it on sale for just a bit over 450.00).  I have a Z790 mobo from Asus (Strix gaming) which is PCIe 5.0 with 64gb of 6400mhz DDR 5 ram CL32 (Corsair Vengeance)  I also have a 1000 watt power supply (Corsair shift - which helps a lot in my case.)  I have a nVidia Asus Strix 3070ti which I am looking to purchase a 5070ti soon.   \n\nI just wanted what would be a good AMD setup as far as a mobo and cpu that is comparable which is powerful, but efficient. I'm ready to go back to AMD and any ideas on specs would help me a lot since I'm not up on AMD like I should.",

I gave him it yesterday and played ghost of tsushima at 90-100fps high settings and r6 siege 180-200fps on medium settings the day i gave it to him. I wake up this morning and now I'm having an issue with not posting and stops at vga. I've reseated the gpu and ram found no scratches or issues with connections, performed cmos reset, and reflashed the bios via bios flash button. When the pcie cables are disconnected and/or the gpu is out the computer post but i am unable to display a screen as the cpu in it does not have integrated graphics. The cpu and mb are and am4 setup with the newest rtx lineup gpu in it and ive heard about a vbios update that they have needed but i am unable to perform this with no display. any sort of insight would be appreciated\n\n  \nMB- ASUS ROG STRIX B550-F *GAMING WIFI II*\n\nCPU- Ryzen 5 2600X\n\nGPU- RTX5060 8GB\n\nRAM- CORSAIR - VENGEANCE RGB PRO 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 3600MHz",

(Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games) - Will be gaming on it and do enjoy streaming from time to time, but isn't necessary to accommodate the streaming.\n\n• ⁠Purchase country? Near Micro Center? (If you're not in a country supported by PCPartPicker, please list some local vendors) - Spain\n\n• ⁠Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate) - Will buy myself a 1440p 240hz or 480hz monitor in the future\n\n• ⁠Budget range? (Include tax considerations) - Willing to go around the €2750-€3000 area, can go higher if the value is there\n\n• ⁠WiFi or wired connection? - Ethernet\n\n• ⁠Size/noise constraints? - Not too bothered but with spending so much don't want it to be blaring noise obviously.\n\n• ⁠Color/lighting preferences? - Not opposed to some nice color/lighting, quite like the look of a white case with a lot of fans inside of it, seen some pictures online of white cases with 5 or so fans inside with light pink color to it (would also like to be able to control the fan color ideally, so I can keep the look fresh) big fan of this so would be cool to get something similar, don't enjoy the rainbow RGB look as much.\n\n• ⁠Any other specific needs? - Wanting 2 SSD’s, ideally one being 2TB for games and the other being 1TB for Windows + Programs, but mainly just would like the PC to look nice and perform well of course, can provide more information if needed so just let me know, thanks!",

    "selftext": "Hello, so recently my pc has been getting blue screens and it was hinted that it was due to PSU not being powerful enough for my components (recently added a 1660 TI).\n\nSo I've bought a new PSU that should last me a long time, even after adding more powerful components in the future if I want to : A Corsair RM1000E.\n\nMy motherboard is a A320M-HDV. My previous one was a Elementum E2 (which seems to be around 350W).\n\nAnyways, so I replaced the PSU and tried to turn it on, but it immediately shut down after turning the fan for one second. I thought I did something wrong, I disconnected and whatnot and noticed that it does run, but shows a blackscreen when I disconnect the CPU cable to the motherboard.\n\n(Note the PSU gives an 8 pin, but the motherboard is only a 4-pin, this is the case with both PSU's).\n\nSo I tried my old psu again and it started up without an issue.\n\nI assume I got a faulty PSU. But could it possible be that the RM1000E is incompatible with my motherboard?\n\nThank you either way. ",

    "selftext": "Hello! I recently bought new Ram (TridentZ RGB DDR4-3600 16GBx2 the specific code is F4-3600C16D-32GTSRC) and am trying to enable XMP to max out the speed.\n  \nI am in unfamiliar territory and didn't even know this was something I needed to do and thought the RAM would auto run at whatever it was labeled as.\n  \nI enabled XMP, but after saving and resetting, my monitor was saying there was no input and my keyboard was not working, but the lights in my computer were on. I did a hard reset, opened BIOS, and got a message that it had crashed with 3 options (I can't remember exactly but it was like enter bios, reset bios and boot, or reset bios and reboot), so I chose to enter BIOS again and tried resetting the memory speed from 3200 (I read this was my max for my CPU(?)) to AUTO. \n  \nAfter saving and restarting, I once again got a black screen. I did another hard reset and instead of going into BIOS, I let my computer start normally. I was able to login fine, and in Task Manager the speed is listed as 3600 MT/s.\n  \nWhat happened and what should I do?

The drive doesn’t show up in BIOS or Windows. At first I thought it might be a bad slot or a bad drive, but here’s what I’ve done so far:  \nTried the NV3 in both M.2 slots on the board  \nUpdated the BIOS to the latest version  \nSet PCIe mode in BIOS to Gen3 (since B450 only supports PCIe 3.0)\n\n Verified in Windows Disk Management (not showing up at all)\n\nReseated the drive, cleared CMOS, tested with/without other SATA drives\n\nTo rule out hardware failure, I tested another NVMe (GoodRAM PX600) in the same slot — it works perfectly. I also tested the Kingston NV3 in a different PC with a newer B850 chipset — and it works fine there too.\n\nSo the drive itself is good, the slot is good, but the NV3 and my B450 just don’t seem to play nicely together.  But how is this possible? What can I do?\n\nAt this point I’m thinking the NV3 just isn’t compatible with my board, even though in theory it should downshift to PCIe 3.0, but then how the PX600 is working ( it was smooth from the start)\n\n***TL:DR:*** Kingston NV3 NVMe works fine in newer systems but won’t show up at all on my B450 board. Tried BIOS update, reseating, Gen3 mode, CMOS reset, etc. Other NVMe drives work in the slot",

    "selftext": "Hey redditors!\n\n  \nIf you're looking for someone's experience on bringing their PC to an international flight, mine might be heplful.\n\nI took my PC on a 3 hour flight with me, and was initially very scared. After watching many tutorials, I settled upon taking the GPU out and entirely filling the interior of the PC with clothes. I've seen people fill it with expandable foam, which is a better option but is way more expensive than just my clothes, that I'll be taking with me anyway. I then wrapped the PC in about 3-4 layers of bubble wrap to keep it from moving. As for the box, anything with enough cushioning should work fine. Use the original PC case box if you still have it, but pretty sure your PC will hardly fit in it anymore because of the bubble wrap, but that box was supposed to handle your empty case, not your built pc. My initial plan was a suitcase, but only go with that if its a hard-shell, but still give a lot of cushioning because the airport staff might reject to label it as \"FRAGILE\" and the airport handlers really don't care about our luggage. Finally, I bought a corrugated box that was pretty tough and in it, surrounded the pc from all 6 sides by foam/clothes. I was travelling with family so had no issue as for the amount of clothes, but you can buy normal foam as well, just make sure it wont start dropping pieces of it when moved around (happens with certain types of foam). I then taped the box as well as I could (almost spent an entire roll) and even sat on it to confirm its rigidity. As for the GPU, I took a rigid box I got with my headphones and after bubble wrapping the GPU, I put it in the box, surrounded by foam as well. I could not find static bag so had to use bubble wrap, but if you manage to find a static bag, often in the original packing of the GPU, use that before bubble wrapping. At the airport, the security officers thankfully did not suspect a thing and I passed security. Before getting the boarding pass and checking in the bag, I told them to label the bag as \"FRAGILE\" and they did so in front of me. But I'm not really sure how much that helped since the side the \"FRAGILE\" was written on is almost everytime not the one facing you. I'm pretty sure the handlers ignored it too. When I reached my home and opened the box, I could see everything in the same condition as I had left it, which was a huge relief. Then I opened the side glass, took out all my clothes, installed the GPU (which arrived in perfect condition too) and powered on the PC. \n\nAnd that's how I successfully brought my PC with me on a flight.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "**Greetings, everyone!**\n\nOur upcoming project - a medieval RPG **Legacy of Valor** \\- is on Kickstarter, and we've already surpassed our first stretch goal.\n\nBut first, I'd like to introduce you to the game itself.\n\n**Legacy of Valor** is a medieval RPG that blends **castle building**, **territory management**, **large-scale battles**, and a **story-driven narrative** into one immersive experience. In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Husák! 😊), but soon, **thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his **passion, enthusiasm, and desire** are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Husák himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to **expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile – and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point, **we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that **Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*“Hey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors — If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you’re gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step — launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign — just like old times — and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let’s rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let’s build that castle from the ground up — together.”*\n\nWe can’t express how much this means to us. **Warhorse Studios inspired us** \\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives **Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let’s carry this legacy forward. **Together!**\n\nKickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit: [r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX: [https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website: [https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

At the time and to this day, I have not seen a banner on Humble's store indicating they are out of keys for Ryse: Son of Rome. I am using Chrome and not running any ad blocker, so I suspect this is not an issue with my personal browser. These banners are referenced in Humble's FAQ on key exhaustion. I have exchanged 3 messages with humble support inquiring about the lack of a banner and if the 60-day refund window applies if I have not received a key. Not only did they take on average 7 days to respond they also talked around my questions and provided no real support. I am willing to give a great deal of leeway, after all, this is for charity. That said, the dishonesty or ineptitude of the support team and the implication that Humble can keep my money and provide me with nothing in return just leaves me with a gross feeling that I can't shake. I will never use this storefront again. I have only ever heard good things about Humble. Am I just phenomenally unlucky, or is this a common experience no one talks about?",

Somewhere.\n\nThe biggest twist, is that the battles are fewer, but longer, with new enemies spawning, dropping loot, and allowing you to craft DURING combat.\n\nIt's a bit like an OVA anime from a larger universe.\n\nWe launched in April, but the game is on sale now, and we added a real nice update during the Autumn sale, so I thought I'd give it a try and tell you about the game.\n\nDesign-wise, I tried to focus on having fewer, but more tactically worthwhile spells, and enemies that are mechanically interesting.\n\nSince launch we've put out a few free updates, and hope to make more. Of note is the extra difficult secret level in the final world. We're very attentive to feedback, and the last update was about helping players deal with how they experienced randomness.\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, both the good and the bad stuff.",

    "selftext": "Just now I was playing mafia 2. I am 9 hours into the game and I started the game with hard difficulty like I have started to do with all of my games recently. I have come at a level that is simply impossible to cross, not because of any skill issue but simply because this game has a bad 'Hard' difficulty mode.\n\nThere are games where hard difficulty simply means a basic buff to all enemies. They function like normal npc's but their damaged is increased, they spot you unreasonably fast, and even their pistols shoot kilometers (miles) away and it takes a takes a whole mag to kill one enemy. Your gameplay does not change. You still take cover and shoot, you simply stay in cover for longer, and have to shoot the same enemy twice as much, but its the same.\n\nIn this particular mission in mafia, the enemies are just unfair. Rather than enemies coordinating better, they and their guns have simply been buffed. And I am not lying when I say this, I cannot shoot a Thompson at my target after a certain distance because of insane recoil, my enemies, with that same Thompson, are killing me with 2 bullets from twice that distance. Molotov cocktails fall in front of my cover but I still get damage, and the most baffling part is that I get some damage even behind covers.\n\nThis is a bad hard mode, although understandable because the game came out in 2010. In such a mode, you can overcome with skill only to be lead to such an instance where skill can not overcome the bad design. Like how my enemy keeps throwing molotovs every 5 seconds in a small space filled with constantly spawning enemies, I peak and someone shoots me, I play smart and get killed by a Molotov that isint even near me.\n\nI am also playing wolfenstein currently and it has a much better hard mode. Its actually challenging but most of all, its reasonably challenging, you can improve and get better or retry until you finally clear a level. Enemy damage does increase but they don't turn into bullet sponges, enemies coordinate better and have better reflexes rather than being one shot kill. In Wolfenstein you just have to plan better, remember the med kits and the Armour and use them strategically. But mafia 2 doesnt offer me any such option, the gameplay is yet the same regardless of difficulty.",

    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nRaivk here, one of the two people working on ULTRA VERTIGO. We initially made this as a sequel to Liminascent, our previous first-person platformer, and renamed it because here in France \"Liminascent\" isn't easy to pronounce...\n\nWell, we had a ton of fun making the game as a side project (besides our boring main jobs), and we are excited to see people playing the demo. It's our first solo project on Steam, as we already released a game with a publisher, but now we want more freedom, hence the self-publishing. We'd be more than happy to get feedback on the game, see what you like, what you dislike so we can enhance it and hopefully make something great in the long run! We're aiming for a release by the end of the year, as most of the \"complete\" game is ready.\n\nThe demo here is just a part of the complete game, to get the feeling of it and see if it's for you. We will probably keep the demo up permanently, as we believe it's better to be able to try a game before buying it.\n\nThat's it! Hope you'll enjoy it. I'll be available to answer any questions you might have.\n\nHere is the link of the game if you want to play!  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA\\_VERTIGO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA_VERTIGO)",

A bright fantasy with an underlying melancholy is how I’d describe the thematic heart of AA and we’ve been incredibly happy to see how many people resonated with it.\n\n**It’s also no lie to say that Astral Ascent was the biggest step forward for us as developers in general, and we’re still incredibly thankful for the community support we received.**\n\nWe’ve also recently launched our next project, [Fallen Fates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276270/Fallen_Fates/), this time a fantasy RPG (instead of a roguelite) built in collaboration with our community through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernian-workshop/fallen-fates). We’ve learned a lot from our past games — Astral Ascent most of all — and want to take everything we love about them and carry it over into this new, even more ambitious project… which, truth be told, probably won’t be done before 2028 (tentatively speaking) just because of the sheer scope of the project.\n\nIn any case, that’s the short of it about us.\n\nIt’s been a long road since we first started making games together, and each one has changed the way we think about what we do. Astral Ascent especially left a mark on us, not just in how we design but in how we see the people playing our work. It reminds us why we do this in the first place, and that’s to make beautiful games people will take joy in playing.\n\n**We’re excited to chat with you all and answer any questions whatsoever!**   \n\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you all! :)",

A string of mysterious student deaths has the whole community on edge… and you, a weary, grizzled ex-detective, have been sent undercover as a “safety auditor” to figure out what’s really going on.\n\nSideEye High is a darkly comedic, mature-themed point-and-click adventure that combines the style of ‘90s classics with modern investigation mechanics. Inspect every hallway, locker, and gum-stained tile—because in this school, everything is evidence.\n\nFeatures:\n\nOne Main Mystery, Dozens of Detours – Solve the core case, or get sidetracked by over 50 false endings, each with its own twisted mini-mystery.\n\nNo Fail States – The week-long investigation ends no matter what, but your choices—and missed clues—shape the outcome.\n\nZoom Beyond the Surface – Get close enough to read notes, see tiny details, or even peek behind objects.\n\nEvery Pixel Matters – Nearly everything is searchable and interactable, down to screws in the wall and scuff marks on the floor.\n\nTime is Your Enemy – Every action costs time. Decide what’s worth investigating before the clock runs out.\n\nMature Dark Humor – 1990s satire that’s sharp, absurd, and occasionally uncomfortably real.\n\nSideEye High is for those who grew up loving adventure games and are ready for one that grew up with them.\n\nNew Demo now available!",

    "selftext": "Windows is very close to being great for gamepads. There are multiple third-party apps (like r/Playnite) that allow for a great gamepad experience in multiple aspects, however, typing is NOT one of them.\n\nA lot of games require typing, which prevents us from having a true couch gaming experience on PC, but there's an easy solution that only Microsoft can provide:\n\n**1 - Allow us to open the new on-screen keyboard (OSK), with gamepad support, that at the moment is reserved for tablets, by clicking or pressing A over text boxes, and through a gamepad button combo.**   \nThis would allow the OSK to be invoked by either simulating a mouse click with the gamepad (for older games), selecting text boxes with A (on modern games that eventually support this feature), or force-opening it with a gamepad combo for games that are particularly iffy with text boxes. This would effectively bypass the need to get out of the sofa and use a keyboard just to name your character in a new RPG, for example. \n\n**2 - Make sure the OSK, on gamepad mode, captures all gamepad inputs for itself, and does not allow these inputs to reach the game in the background.**  \nThis would prevent a big problem with the already existing Steam keyboard: if you're not playing the game with SteamInput enabled (for example, in games that already support Xbox gamepads), all the gamepad buttons being pressed while typing are also reaching the game, causing your character to walk, attack or do whatever actions correspond to the typing shortcuts, including leaving the text box in case of emulators. Capturing all inputs from the gamepad and only sending what is actually being typed (the keyboard keys) would prevent this, and massively increase compatibility with older games.\n\n**Bonus:** give us the fullscreen Windows experience for desktops, and allow it to use custom library managers (like Playnite). This would fix a lot of problems with window focus that can happen when launching games in borderless fullscreen and also make the experience more seamless. \n\nI believe these tweaks would greatly improve the gaming experience on Windows, bringing it much closer to an authentic Xbox experience.",

Each one has unique traits and drops items that can be used to craft decorations, furniture, and lures. Sometimes they get attacked by Ghosts who just want to spoil the fun.\n\nThe demo covers the first seven in-game days (around 1.5-2 hours of play). You can:\n\n* Attract and care for your first Critterlings\n* Decorate your farm and house with dozens of craftable items\n* Experiment with items that lure specific species\n* Meet the Townfolk and explore the beach\n\nIt’s colorful, weird, and hopefully very cozy.\n\n👉 **Play the demo here:** [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2497070/Cosmic\\_Coop/]()\n\nI’ll be hanging out in the comments to answer any questions about development, inspiration, or the design process.\n\nThanks for checking it out and for supporting small devs during Next Fest!",

Players will have unprecedented terraforming control, and will be able to \"own\" planets and interact in a galactic economy.\n\nKoster gives more details on the system in this longform chat, such as the limitations they had to place on moving fire and water, the methods of creation and sustainability they implemented to counteract the methods of destruction, and how different species of plants and animals evolve.\n\nIn developer circles he's also well known for writing A Theory of Fun, and there's a large section of the chat devoted to game design theory. At the time the book was written, \"are games art?\" was a hot topic, and 20 years later he's happy to revisit that and recount how gaming has progressed.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "**Greetings, everyone!**\n\nOur upcoming project - a medieval RPG **Legacy of Valor** \\- is on Kickstarter, and we've already surpassed our first stretch goal.\n\nBut first, I'd like to introduce you to the game itself.\n\n**Legacy of Valor** is a medieval RPG that blends **castle building**, **territory management**, **large-scale battles**, and a **story-driven narrative** into one immersive experience. In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Husák! 😊), but soon, **thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his **passion, enthusiasm, and desire** are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Husák himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to **expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile – and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point, **we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that **Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*“Hey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors — If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you’re gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step — launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign — just like old times — and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let’s rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power.

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

No windows, no bios, but the computer turns on and lights up. I happen to notice after looking at it for a bit that one of the Q-LED lights is on. The one for the CPU. I absolutely don’t want to remove the cooler and CPU unless I must and It seems odd to me that the CPU would just...randomly explode, so I was wondering if anyone had some ideas here.\n\nThings I’ve tried already include:\n\nDifferent monitors\n\nDifferent cables\n\nPlugging display into the motherboard\n\nUnplugging any non-essential items\n\nRe-seating RAM\n\nTrying to boot with one stick of RAM\n\nClearing the CMOS\n\nRemoving the GPU",

I really don't mind about the mic, only needs to be ok.\n\nThen, it must be comfortable, as I will be wearing it for hours (with glasses).\n\nOn the other side, I'm open to wired headsets, however I prefer wireless ones if sound quality isn't highly decreased.\n\nThese are the options I have been thinking on:\n\n\\- SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless\n\n\\- Logitech G PRO X2 Lightspeed (wireless)\n\n\\- Audeze Maxwell (I think that this are not that comfortable)\n\n\\-  Bose QuietComfort Ultra gen2 Not sure if works for gaming.",

It doesn't help that at 6'4 I cast a big shadow, obscuring my collection of movies, books, etc.\n\nI could use some lighting ideas. I've used [these portable motion sensor lights](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTGZ6S28?th) for some of my action figure shelves, which work well enough but don't hold a charge for very long. Plus my DVD shelves are a lot thinner so I don't think they would work as well.\n\nI've heard of gamer light strips, but I'm also very ignorant how they work, and specifically whether they're good for actual illumination or just for rave bar aesthetic purposes. I very much would like lights that I can turn on and adjust with my Alexa, but once again I don't know which ones to get, or whether it's better to get one long strip that surrounds the shelves or strips that I can cut into smaller pieces. \n\nI've broken the bank enough times already this year, so whatever is an elegant and cost-effective solution would be preferred.

The Case comes with a filter for the top and and the bottom, however, both are inside the case. I chose to negate the Top Filter and remove it completely due to that being exhausts, and if there is dust that gets past, I have no desire to keep it trapped inside, especially when I can just blow it out.  \nanyways, the bottom filter was going to be an issue, as the fans were the fist part of the loop that was going in.  once the GPU was in, the fans are stuck, Neverminded that my Fill port was going to be stuck between them (see green line of Photo 16). so I chose to take the bottom filter out and attach the Fans directly to the grid of the case. I then used the feet of the case to pinch and hold in place the filter to the bottom of the outside of the case. (see photo 10). so now when it becomes time to clean the Filter, I dont need inside the PC nor, do I need to empty the loop to gain access to do so.  \nI did Cut and shape a Filter for the back (not pictured), rear (photo 11), and top (photo 12, well get back to that later). The Purpose of such was/is 2 fold. For the rear, it acts as a dust filter for the intake fan, and also as a passive air flow restrictor. on the back, it air filters for the PSU, but is primarily used for passive airflow restriction. (additionally, it made the Rear Intake fan quieter than without the Filter, so bonus positive!)  \nIt is a positive pressure system, with 4 intake, 2 exhaust, and everywhere that isnt the radiator has a dust filter for the purpose to redirect all other passive airflow through the radiator where the 240 fans arnt (see photo 15).\n\nOne large issue I ran into with the parts I had chosen was getting the Top radiator and Fans Level. Unfortunately, I dont have any photos of this, so youll just have to take my word for it. my resolution was to Attach the fans to the radiator, and the radiator Directly to the Top pannel, much in the same way I attached the Fans at the bottom of the case. it is important to not that the case was not designed to do such a thing. the Radiator only had the center 4 screw holes align to an open space of the grid on top.  \nadditionally, I had remove the Mounting brackets for the top fans so that the radiator was unobstructed to the top pannel. this came with a bonus positive of another \\~1/2 inch (sorry, I'm American) of vertical height to play with for the Tubing.  \nThe case comes compatible with a 120 or 140 width fans, adjusted by moving one of the support bars to the 140 width opposed to the 120 width it comes with. I actually removed the font fan support bracket and moved the back one to the 140 compatible spot to help retain case rigidity. this was cool because it actually was a wide enough adjustment that it stayed out of the way of the Radiator as well!  \nFinally, I added a Filter to restrict the passive airflow out the top behind the radiator. This one is on the inside of the case, opposed to the outside, because as previously stated, the air inside is already supposed to be filtered in addition to its sole purpose is to encourage the Passive moving air though the radiator. \n\nbending the tubes was much less of a chore than I thought it was gonna be. the chore was getting the exact bends I wanted. I ran out of tube that came in the \"starter pack\" otherwise I would have tried a few more times to get the bends to be compliantly Parallel.  \nI'm glad I wasnt commissioned for the bends, but as the one to enjoy it I am more than happy with how it turned out, especially as first time Bender.  \non one hand, being an MATX case it was cramped to work in, but it really wasnt an issue. and the added benefit of less length of tube to fight. the one at the top back would be a concern, but it was a clone parallel run for the one in front, so I just measured from and copied that one.  \nthat was also my tight bend since It was going to be the hardest to see. (short of the fill port, but that one isnt a tight or complicated bend.)\n\nFilling this was much more of a Butt than I expected it to be. While I did include a fill port, allowing the case to be stood on its end, and the fill port becomes the highest point in the system, I failed to recognize, that in order to fill smoothly, you need enough water weight to push the water in the fill port back up to the next highest point in the loop. I didnt feel like spending another 5 bucks and a week of waiting for another fitting to arrive, so I suffered by filling the fill port, closing it and then rolling the whole pc until the fill port was empty enough to refill, opening the fill port, letting a little bit of air escape, repeat... many, many times.  I got a little sore the next day and there is a dent in my folding table from where I kept putting the corner of the system to take a break...  \nin hind sight, I would get that one more fitting and a manual air pump, or a much larger funnel (which would make a large mess once the loop is filled to remove... but id be prepared for it.  \nI let it run for about an hour on its own with nothing else plugged in and no leaks on the first try!\n\nAdjust the RGB to get rid of the Unicorn Vomit and Voila! build complete! for the photos they are all set to white, however I have the Signal RGB set to screen ambiance for how I actually use it. (again, please forgive lack of photos)\n\nFor initial benchmarking, I looped the Horizon Zero Dawn (my main game I'll be playing) Benchmark many times at 4k no scaling and no framegen, temps were consistent where the CPU sits \\~58 degrees at \\~60% usage, GPU at \\~39 degrees, at 100% usage. and called it night.  \nthe next day, I ran Horizon Forbidden West at 4k no scaling no frame gen and temps are as follows: GPU temp: \\~47c (memory temp 76c) @ 100% usage (\\~85fps)  \nCPU temp: \\~70c usage is still \\~30-33%  (I think CPU temp is so high because it's second in the loop, but I'm not terribly concerned) This was with PBO enabled GPU auto overclock of +105 MHz offset via AMD app's Auto Overclock. CPU is also auto overclocked, not sure it's actually using it though due to low usage.\n\n# The plan for the Future\n\nMight try for some new/better bends when it comes time to clean the loop. (either the liquid or the tubes themselves) also, Id commission an actual piece of glass/mirror to cover the PSU, not just a film (the PSU base wasnt flat, so the Infinity mirror effect is blurred, but still there). otherwise, I am completely happy with this build. I have heard that you can get mirror acrylic, so I'll more likely go for that.  \nAlso, having said that, I am curious to know if I can get an actual Mirror backplace for the GPU block opposed to just the film as well?  \nhoping when it comes time to clean out the loop. there will be a reverse and/or RGB Apex Fan to replace the intake on the rear... there isnt another fan like it, so this was literally the best option I could come up with until that's a thing.  \nAlso also, curious to see what loop I could come up with if I got the right distro instead of left (or vice versa). not sure I'm gonna spend the money to do so, at least not on the first teardown Maintenance.\n\nmy plan for the PC is to run it until the CPU is outdated. I know right now there isnt a consumer tier GPU that actually fully utilizes the CPU, so my plan is to wait until we find that GPU, and then ill get and waterblock that, and then I am gonna run that system with no more upgrades until the system dies or it cant run the games I play.\n\nAdditionally, I'm hoping to Dual Boot the PC over to Steam OS once the Recovery image is updated to the Appropriate Kernel to run on the 9070XT. but thats neither here nor there at this point.",

Just after a few matches of battlefield 6, I quit the game for some chrome browsing before sleep, and bam, a few minutes and it turns black, and my GPU turns into a Jet engine again, whenever it is past 11pm.\n\nAt this point I don't even know what I'm dealing with anymore.

So i wanted to add some intake fans an had to tear it apart to plug them in because the aio blocks the whole top of the mb in the montech xr. Decided im going to pull off the cooler check to make sure everything is right an repaste an see if i get better temps. Its only a 9600x. Full out pbo and a optimized negative curve it will go to about 85-88c on cinebench idles around 44c. With the air cooler it would go up to low 90s. Idk if this is normal or not. But when i pulled the pump head off there was a shiny substance on maybe 3 corners of the cpu. Not big but on one of the corners it looks like it left a mark on the cooler too. I couldnt find a leak on the aio anywhere an where the liquid was it would of had to seep through the metal plate which i dont see happening. So i put it back on an pulled it off again the next day. It looked like it was starting to happen again on one of the corners really small. Can thermal paste get like that? I feel like if it was a liquid it wouldnt of stayed right there. Any ideas whats going on? Should i rid the aio? Lol got me worried now.",

You have a unique ability to corrupt and possess human-made machinery. This clip is a small part of the final boss encounter.\n\nGames by Valve got me into game dev, so I'm really happy that I'm getting close to finishing a project of my own, which is inspired by the classics.\n\nBack in 2007, when I was about 12 years old, I discovered Valve Hammer Editor and started making my own maps for CS 1.6, which I then played over LAN with my brother and cousin. After that, I slowly started falling in love with the universe of Half-Life & Portal. I remember being scared by those games, and I had to play them behind my brother’s back so he wouldn’t find out. \\^\\^\n\nThese days, I work in the game dev industry as a freelancer, but in the evenings I always try to find time to work on little projects of my own.\n\nThe game I’ve been trying to finish and release for the past \\~2 years is called SECTOR ZERO. It’s a physics-based, dark sci-fi puzzle adventure where you play as a fragment of an ancient hive-mind entity that lies dormant in the core of a huge asteroid, but it gets awakened by human mining operations.I'm trying to capture a bit of that Half-Life and Portal magic I grew up with.\n\nThere’s also a \\~25-minute demo you can check out if you’d like to get a feel for how the game plays.  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352050/SECTOR\\_ZERO/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352050/SECTOR_ZERO/)  \nIf this looks like something you would enjoy you can support the game by wishlisting it on Steam!\n\nIf you have any feedback or questions, let me know! \\^\\^",

The Case comes with a filter for the top and and the bottom, however, both are inside the case. I chose to negate the Top Filter and remove it completely due to that being exhausts, and if there is dust that gets past, I have no desire to keep it trapped inside, especially when I can just blow it out.  \nanyways, the bottom filter was going to be an issue, as the fans were the fist part of the loop that was going in.  once the GPU was in, the fans are stuck, Neverminded that my Fill port was going to be stuck between them (see green line of Photo 16). so I chose to take the bottom filter out and attach the Fans directly to the grid of the case. I then used the feet of the case to pinch and hold in place the filter to the bottom of the outside of the case. (see photo 10). so now when it becomes time to clean the Filter, I dont need inside the PC nor, do I need to empty the loop to gain access to do so.  \nI did Cut and shape a Filter for the back (not pictured), rear (photo 11), and top (photo 12, well get back to that later). The Purpose of such was/is 2 fold. For the rear, it acts as a dust filter for the intake fan, and also as a passive air flow restrictor. on the back, it air filters for the PSU, but is primarily used for passive airflow restriction. (additionally, it made the Rear Intake fan quieter than without the Filter, so bonus positive!)  \nIt is a positive pressure system, with 4 intake, 2 exhaust, and everywhere that isnt the radiator has a dust filter for the purpose to redirect all other passive airflow through the radiator where the 240 fans arnt (see photo 15).\n\nOne large issue I ran into with the parts I had chosen was getting the Top radiator and Fans Level. Unfortunately, I dont have any photos of this, so youll just have to take my word for it. my resolution was to Attach the fans to the radiator, and the radiator Directly to the Top pannel, much in the same way I attached the Fans at the bottom of the case. it is important to not that the case was not designed to do such a thing. the Radiator only had the center 4 screw holes align to an open space of the grid on top.  \nadditionally, I had remove the Mounting brackets for the top fans so that the radiator was unobstructed to the top pannel. this came with a bonus positive of another \\~1/2 inch (sorry, I'm American) of vertical height to play with for the Tubing.  \nThe case comes compatible with a 120 or 140 width fans, adjusted by moving one of the support bars to the 140 width opposed to the 120 width it comes with. I actually removed the font fan support bracket and moved the back one to the 140 compatible spot to help retain case rigidity. this was cool because it actually was a wide enough adjustment that it stayed out of the way of the Radiator as well!  \nFinally, I added a Filter to restrict the passive airflow out the top behind the radiator. This one is on the inside of the case, opposed to the outside, because as previously stated, the air inside is already supposed to be filtered in addition to its sole purpose is to encourage the Passive moving air though the radiator. \n\nbending the tubes was much less of a chore than I thought it was gonna be. the chore was getting the exact bends I wanted. I ran out of tube that came in the \"starter pack\" otherwise I would have tried a few more times to get the bends to be compliantly Parallel.  \nI'm glad I wasnt commissioned for the bends, but as the one to enjoy it I am more than happy with how it turned out, especially as first time Bender.  \non one hand, being an MATX case it was cramped to work in, but it really wasnt an issue. and the added benefit of less length of tube to fight. the one at the top back would be a concern, but it was a clone parallel run for the one in front, so I just measured from and copied that one.  \nthat was also my tight bend since It was going to be the hardest to see. (short of the fill port, but that one isnt a tight or complicated bend.)\n\nFilling this was much more of a Butt than I expected it to be. While I did include a fill port, allowing the case to be stood on its end, and the fill port becomes the highest point in the system, I failed to recognize, that in order to fill smoothly, you need enough water weight to push the water in the fill port back up to the next highest point in the loop. I didnt feel like spending another 5 bucks and a week of waiting for another fitting to arrive, so I suffered by filling the fill port, closing it and then rolling the whole pc until the fill port was empty enough to refill, opening the fill port, letting a little bit of air escape, repeat... many, many times.  I got a little sore the next day and there is a dent in my folding table from where I kept putting the corner of the system to take a break...  \nin hind sight, I would get that one more fitting and a manual air pump, or a much larger funnel (which would make a large mess once the loop is filled to remove... but id be prepared for it.  \nI let it run for about an hour on its own with nothing else plugged in and no leaks on the first try!\n\nAdjust the RGB to get rid of the Unicorn Vomit and Voila! build complete! for the photos they are all set to white, however I have the Signal RGB set to screen ambiance for how I actually use it. (again, please forgive lack of photos)\n\nFor initial benchmarking, I looped the Horizon Zero Dawn (my main game I'll be playing) Benchmark many times at 4k no scaling and no framegen, temps were consistent where the CPU sits \\~58 degrees at \\~60% usage, GPU at \\~39 degrees, at 100% usage. and called it night.  \nthe next day, I ran Horizon Forbidden West at 4k no scaling no frame gen and temps are as follows: GPU temp: \\~47c (memory temp 76c) @ 100% usage (\\~85fps)  \nCPU temp: \\~70c usage is still \\~30-33%  (I think CPU temp is so high because it's second in the loop, but I'm not terribly concerned) This was with PBO enabled GPU auto overclock of +105 MHz offset via AMD app's Auto Overclock. CPU is also auto overclocked, not sure it's actually using it though due to low usage.\n\n# The plan for the Future\n\nMight try for some new/better bends when it comes time to clean the loop. (either the liquid or the tubes themselves) also, Id commission an actual piece of glass/mirror to cover the PSU, not just a film (the PSU base wasnt flat, so the Infinity mirror effect is blurred, but still there). otherwise, I am completely happy with this build. I have heard that you can get mirror acrylic, so I'll more likely go for that.  \nAlso, having said that, I am curious to know if I can get an actual Mirror backplace for the GPU block opposed to just the film as well?  \nhoping when it comes time to clean out the loop. there will be a reverse and/or RGB Apex Fan to replace the intake on the rear... there isnt another fan like it, so this was literally the best option I could come up with until that's a thing.  \nAlso also, curious to see what loop I could come up with if I got the right distro instead of left (or vice versa). not sure I'm gonna spend the money to do so, at least not on the first teardown Maintenance.\n\nmy plan for the PC is to run it until the CPU is outdated. I know right now there isnt a consumer tier GPU that actually fully utilizes the CPU, so my plan is to wait until we find that GPU, and then ill get and waterblock that, and then I am gonna run that system with no more upgrades until the system dies or it cant run the games I play.\n\nAdditionally, I'm hoping to Dual Boot the PC over to Steam OS once the Recovery image is updated to the Appropriate Kernel to run on the 9070XT. but thats neither here nor there at this point.",

You have a unique ability to corrupt and possess human-made machinery. This clip is a small part of the final boss encounter.\n\nGames by Valve got me into game dev, so I'm really happy that I'm getting close to finishing a project of my own, which is inspired by the classics.\n\nBack in 2007, when I was about 12 years old, I discovered Valve Hammer Editor and started making my own maps for CS 1.6, which I then played over LAN with my brother and cousin. After that, I slowly started falling in love with the universe of Half-Life & Portal. I remember being scared by those games, and I had to play them behind my brother’s back so he wouldn’t find out. \\^\\^\n\nThese days, I work in the game dev industry as a freelancer, but in the evenings I always try to find time to work on little projects of my own.\n\nThe game I’ve been trying to finish and release for the past \\~2 years is called SECTOR ZERO. It’s a physics-based, dark sci-fi puzzle adventure where you play as a fragment of an ancient hive-mind entity that lies dormant in the core of a huge asteroid, but it gets awakened by human mining operations.I'm trying to capture a bit of that Half-Life and Portal magic I grew up with.\n\nThere’s also a \\~25-minute demo you can check out if you’d like to get a feel for how the game plays.  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352050/SECTOR\\_ZERO/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352050/SECTOR_ZERO/)  \nIf this looks like something you would enjoy you can support the game by wishlisting it on Steam!\n\nIf you have any feedback or questions, let me know! \\^\\^",

The Case comes with a filter for the top and and the bottom, however, both are inside the case. I chose to negate the Top Filter and remove it completely due to that being exhausts, and if there is dust that gets past, I have no desire to keep it trapped inside, especially when I can just blow it out.  \nanyways, the bottom filter was going to be an issue, as the fans were the fist part of the loop that was going in.  once the GPU was in, the fans are stuck, Neverminded that my Fill port was going to be stuck between them (see green line of Photo 16). so I chose to take the bottom filter out and attach the Fans directly to the grid of the case. I then used the feet of the case to pinch and hold in place the filter to the bottom of the outside of the case. (see photo 10). so now when it becomes time to clean the Filter, I dont need inside the PC nor, do I need to empty the loop to gain access to do so.  \nI did Cut and shape a Filter for the back (not pictured), rear (photo 11), and top (photo 12, well get back to that later). The Purpose of such was/is 2 fold. For the rear, it acts as a dust filter for the intake fan, and also as a passive air flow restrictor. on the back, it air filters for the PSU, but is primarily used for passive airflow restriction. (additionally, it made the Rear Intake fan quieter than without the Filter, so bonus positive!)  \nIt is a positive pressure system, with 4 intake, 2 exhaust, and everywhere that isnt the radiator has a dust filter for the purpose to redirect all other passive airflow through the radiator where the 240 fans arnt (see photo 15).\n\nOne large issue I ran into with the parts I had chosen was getting the Top radiator and Fans Level. Unfortunately, I dont have any photos of this, so youll just have to take my word for it. my resolution was to Attach the fans to the radiator, and the radiator Directly to the Top pannel, much in the same way I attached the Fans at the bottom of the case. it is important to not that the case was not designed to do such a thing. the Radiator only had the center 4 screw holes align to an open space of the grid on top.  \nadditionally, I had remove the Mounting brackets for the top fans so that the radiator was unobstructed to the top pannel. this came with a bonus positive of another \\~1/2 inch (sorry, I'm American) of vertical height to play with for the Tubing.  \nThe case comes compatible with a 120 or 140 width fans, adjusted by moving one of the support bars to the 140 width opposed to the 120 width it comes with. I actually removed the font fan support bracket and moved the back one to the 140 compatible spot to help retain case rigidity. this was cool because it actually was a wide enough adjustment that it stayed out of the way of the Radiator as well!  \nFinally, I added a Filter to restrict the passive airflow out the top behind the radiator. This one is on the inside of the case, opposed to the outside, because as previously stated, the air inside is already supposed to be filtered in addition to its sole purpose is to encourage the Passive moving air though the radiator. \n\nbending the tubes was much less of a chore than I thought it was gonna be. the chore was getting the exact bends I wanted. I ran out of tube that came in the \"starter pack\" otherwise I would have tried a few more times to get the bends to be compliantly Parallel.  \nI'm glad I wasnt commissioned for the bends, but as the one to enjoy it I am more than happy with how it turned out, especially as first time Bender.  \non one hand, being an MATX case it was cramped to work in, but it really wasnt an issue. and the added benefit of less length of tube to fight. the one at the top back would be a concern, but it was a clone parallel run for the one in front, so I just measured from and copied that one.  \nthat was also my tight bend since It was going to be the hardest to see. (short of the fill port, but that one isnt a tight or complicated bend.)\n\nFilling this was much more of a Butt than I expected it to be. While I did include a fill port, allowing the case to be stood on its end, and the fill port becomes the highest point in the system, I failed to recognize, that in order to fill smoothly, you need enough water weight to push the water in the fill port back up to the next highest point in the loop. I didnt feel like spending another 5 bucks and a week of waiting for another fitting to arrive, so I suffered by filling the fill port, closing it and then rolling the whole pc until the fill port was empty enough to refill, opening the fill port, letting a little bit of air escape, repeat... many, many times.  I got a little sore the next day and there is a dent in my folding table from where I kept putting the corner of the system to take a break...  \nin hind sight, I would get that one more fitting and a manual air pump, or a much larger funnel (which would make a large mess once the loop is filled to remove... but id be prepared for it.  \nI let it run for about an hour on its own with nothing else plugged in and no leaks on the first try!\n\nAdjust the RGB to get rid of the Unicorn Vomit and Voila! build complete! for the photos they are all set to white, however I have the Signal RGB set to screen ambiance for how I actually use it. (again, please forgive lack of photos)\n\nFor initial benchmarking, I looped the Horizon Zero Dawn (my main game I'll be playing) Benchmark many times at 4k no scaling and no framegen, temps were consistent where the CPU sits \\~58 degrees at \\~60% usage, GPU at \\~39 degrees, at 100% usage. and called it night.  \nthe next day, I ran Horizon Forbidden West at 4k no scaling no frame gen and temps are as follows: GPU temp: \\~47c (memory temp 76c) @ 100% usage (\\~85fps)  \nCPU temp: \\~70c usage is still \\~30-33%  (I think CPU temp is so high because it's second in the loop, but I'm not terribly concerned) This was with PBO enabled GPU auto overclock of +105 MHz offset via AMD app's Auto Overclock. CPU is also auto overclocked, not sure it's actually using it though due to low usage.\n\n# The plan for the Future\n\nMight try for some new/better bends when it comes time to clean the loop. (either the liquid or the tubes themselves) also, Id commission an actual piece of glass/mirror to cover the PSU, not just a film (the PSU base wasnt flat, so the Infinity mirror effect is blurred, but still there). otherwise, I am completely happy with this build. I have heard that you can get mirror acrylic, so I'll more likely go for that.  \nAlso, having said that, I am curious to know if I can get an actual Mirror backplace for the GPU block opposed to just the film as well?  \nhoping when it comes time to clean out the loop. there will be a reverse and/or RGB Apex Fan to replace the intake on the rear... there isnt another fan like it, so this was literally the best option I could come up with until that's a thing.  \nAlso also, curious to see what loop I could come up with if I got the right distro instead of left (or vice versa). not sure I'm gonna spend the money to do so, at least not on the first teardown Maintenance.\n\nmy plan for the PC is to run it until the CPU is outdated. I know right now there isnt a consumer tier GPU that actually fully utilizes the CPU, so my plan is to wait until we find that GPU, and then ill get and waterblock that, and then I am gonna run that system with no more upgrades until the system dies or it cant run the games I play.\n\nAdditionally, I'm hoping to Dual Boot the PC over to Steam OS once the Recovery image is updated to the Appropriate Kernel to run on the 9070XT. but thats neither here nor there at this point.",

I was able to make the MagSafe mount for $8 and the monitor riser I made myself by using the same dimensions from various manufacturers. \n\nRocking a 34” LG ultra-wide and man I love it. Have basic Logitech pebble key 2 and a Logitech M550.\n\nI’ve got only one cable coming to the Mac which is my HP dock located under my desk (wish I could post more pictures)\n\nGot my DJ mixer up top as I love DJing but since I’m full time school I’ve really been off that and focused on school. Really like my setup I’ve only got one cable coming down which is my power cable and cable management is really clean. This also took me a bit as I was trying to figure out the best solution. My solution was using a server rack cable management module that’s aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you’d do!",

    "selftext": "**Please ignore the cables and mess, that is currently in progress to be fixed.**  \n  \nI’m trying to add a 4th display under my main monitor. All three of my current monitors are wall-mounted, so there’s about an 8.5-inch vertical gap between the desk and the bottom edge of the middle screen. I’d like to fill that space with a small monitor that can tilt upward toward me, something around 15 inches smaller or larger is fine if it fits nicely.\n\nI work two remote jobs. My main desktop runs my primary job, and my company laptop handles a second, lighter role where I mostly respond to messages and manage a small team. Both setups really benefit from having two screens. I plan to use a KVM switch to share my keyboard/mouse and possibly one or two monitors between the systems, but I’d like a dedicated screen underneath the middle monitor for quick multitasking.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Fits within an 8.5-inch gap under my center monitor\n* Can tilt upward (20–35° ideally)\n* Doesn’t need to be fancy — 1080p is fine\n* Ideally plug-and-play (HDMI or USB-C)\n* Clean look that blends well with my setup\n\nI’ve looked into stretch bar displays, which would look amazing, but most are expensive or complicated to set up. So I’m leaning toward a portable monitor as a practical option for now. I just want to see if anyone has found a budget-friendly tilted display that fits under a main monitor like this.",

I currently use a chair with a footrest and really enjoy stretching my legs out while working or gaming — but it’s frustrating having my feet hit the wall when I do so. I’d also love a setup that gives me enough space to write on paper without needing to move my keyboard out of the way. For reference, I am 6ft1 and my floor to hip distance is about 40in, so i assumed a 45” depth desk would satisfy this. I just cannot seem to find one .\n\nAn L-shaped desk seems ideal,as it would give me the flexibility and space I’m after. I do have a rather large 45” monitor, but I plan to mount it on a wall arm, so that should help with space management.\n\nI’m not opposed to building a desk myself, but I’d prefer to find something ready-made if possible. (Please excuse the mess by the way!)",

It’s been a while since I’ve bought monitors and a new computer so not even sure what I should be looking for now. \n\nAny recommendations here?

I was able to make the MagSafe mount for $8 and the monitor riser I made myself by using the same dimensions from various manufacturers. \n\nRocking a 34” LG ultra-wide and man I love it. Have basic Logitech pebble key 2 and a Logitech M550.\n\nI’ve got only one cable coming to the Mac which is my HP dock located under my desk (wish I could post more pictures)\n\nGot my DJ mixer up top as I love DJing but since I’m full time school I’ve really been off that and focused on school. Really like my setup I’ve only got one cable coming down which is my power cable and cable management is really clean. This also took me a bit as I was trying to figure out the best solution. My solution was using a server rack cable management module that’s aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you’d do!",

It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper. \n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I just about had it after about 10 keys with the problem. I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone but I am just about fed up with reliability issues and GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust that 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at odd locaiton. What other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

I messaged the moderator of the Geek Hack interest checked forums, and they have not replied yet. So I thought I would make this post here also.\n\nI've got the prototype complete. If you guys have any suggestions of where I should sell this or if anyone would like to partner with me, please let me know.\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**ANSI60**\n\nA 4mm keyboard plate with multiple layout support.\n\n**Supported Layouts**\n\n* Split Backspace\n* Split Right Shift\n* Stepped Caps Lock\n* 7u Spacebar\n\n[Supported Layouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YHOHfZDZJXJPjWIfWgxHSUXzf9Ksx9y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Aluminum\n* Polycarbonate (PC)\n\n**Compatibility**\n\n* **Mounting styles:** Tray Mount\n* **Form factor:** 60% ANSI\n\n**Supported PCBs**\n\n* Venom HE 60% PCB\n* GH60 and DZ60 variants\n* Wooting 60HE\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**Introduction / Vision**\n\nIntroducing the **ANSI60** — a 4mm keyboard plate crafted for enthusiasts seeking to push the boundaries of typing acoustics and feel.   \nAt nearly three times the thickness of a standard 1.5mm plate, the ANSI60 transforms vibrational behavior, producing a crisper, more rounded tone with a fuller frequency response across the sound spectrum.\n\nMore than just thicker — the ANSI60 delivers a distinct typing experience unlike standard 1.5mm plates. With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested.

    "title": "HMX Firecracker has tickled a weird part of my brain and I may never recover: a review.",
    "selftext": "First and foremost - I'm a tactile switch lover through and through. I've tried a fair number this year, the most recent being the Sillyworks x Gateron Type R. I've tried both more budget options (I see you Akko V3 Cream Blue Pro!) and more premium offerings like the Drop x Invyr Holy Pandas. I've spent too much money but honestly I no longer care because I may have found IT. The one. Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

Not usually a place to go for cheap vintage things as they generally know what's good and price accordingly.  For instance this was right next to a Model M keyboard for $150 which I felt was a little over priced.  Now obviously this will take some work to make it usable.  There are broken rivets so it will need a bolt mod in addition to building a case of some sorts and something to connect to the membrane cables to wire up to a controller.  But the keycaps are very cool and split a spacebar... heck yeah.  For now, it'll sit in the collection as I have a long list of projects to work on.  But someday, this thing will rock again.",

I like hiding a fun 60% build in the 5th slot personally :)\n\nKeyboard Protection:\nStands are stable, support 15 lbs per shelf and have been thoroughly strength tested. Cork pads and silicone bumpers are built into each shelf to ensure boards are fully protected and prevent slippage. The bottom of the stand is also equipped with silicone pads to ensure the stand itself doesn't slide around.\n\nUSB Dongle/Flash Drive Storage:\nOffers USB dongle storage for storing and keeping track of wireless dongles as well as flash drives (28 slots total). Note these are not powered or connected, they are purely for storage. No more mixing up or losing your wireless dongles!\n\nPegboard Slots:\nThe back of the stand is equipped with skadis slots for various purposes. The stands are compatible with a variety of skadis accessories and hooks. There are also two slots on each side of the stand for a side hook/accessory. Be on the lookout for skadis accessories to start showing up on the Clackify store as well!\n\n14 Color Options:\nThere are a variety of color options ranging from simple colors to translucent and even Galaxy (sort of metallic) options.\n\nCustomizations:\nIf you'd like to have anything customized, don't hesitate to reach out! Other colors would be possible, and design tweaks could potentially be made for a small fee. Adding logos is also a possibility.\n\nFree US Shipping:\nKeyboard Stands (and any orders over $75 for that matter) ship free to locations in the US.\n\nMore information and photos can be found here: https://clackify.com/products/clackify-keyboard-stand-4-tier\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!

It’s kinda misses that “premium” feeling that they trying to make;\n\n2) QC should be better, because I have two not properly cut seats for switches in foam;\n\n3) Extra options for gasket mount with those small silicone things;\n\n4) Glued(?) to the back of pcb foam for sound dumping. It would be nicer if I could easily remove it;\n\nSoo… In the end I’m not disappointed but, at the same time I think they didn’t deliver to the level which you expect from €140 product.

    "selftext": "I have built/modded several premium boards, but regardless of that fact,  I picked up a used Ducky One Mini. I had seen a video by Alex Otos, praising his 60% Ducky budget keyboard. He said it was his go-to for gaming. Therefore I decided to pick one up and guess what? I love it. I can’t really explain it, but it just feels good to type on. It has a quiet sound profile (which I typically hate), and has a pretty minimalist vibe to it.\n\nWhen I first bought it (used off of eBay), I immediately regretted it because I felt I overpaid for it after I foolishly looked around and found some for half the price. As soon as I got it, I tried to swap out keycaps and those freakin’ inductive switches came out with every single keycap! I soon realized the used budget keycap set I had grabbed (off of eBay, as well) were way too tight. I had to fight every single switch to get it out of the keycap I had pulled off (when I decided I didn’t like them and chose to go back to the original keycaps). They were so hard to detach from the keycaps, my hands were killing me. I finally resorted to a rubber jar gripper that made the job a little easier as I got down to the last few keycaps.\n\nThe inductive switches came out crazy easy and I was not happy about that. However, when I got it back together again and just chose a few colorful keycaps for some modifier keys, I liked the simple look of it (and I will never again swap out the keycaps!) My hands literally ached the entire next day. \n\nHowever, after using it for a few days, I was hooked!  You have got feel it to understand it.\n\nLayout: 60%\nConnectivity: Tri-mode\nCase: ABS\nMount Style: Gasket-mount\nPlate material: SPCC Steel\nSwitches: Ducky Inductive Switches-linear, 3.5 mm total travel, 40g initial force\nDampening Design: Ducky QUACK Mechanics+ with 7-layer dampening\nKeycaps: Ducky 85% high-purity PBT Double-shot PBT\nStabalizers: Ducky Plate-Mounted\nHot-Swappable: Yes\nReport Rate: 1000 Hz\nSoftware: Web-based \nModifier Keycaps - Double-shot PBT (Ali Express)\n\n",

And I love it! I got all parts and built it nearly two days ago.\n\nI had no experience on mechanical keyboards (unless we count typing some Red Dragon keyboard I found in some store for one second), so I was gambling how the switches should behave. And I really like what I chose... I don't want to say I hit the jackpot yet, still a very new keyboard.\n\nThe keycaps have an uneven height... You can see on the function keys on the middle. But so far, not an actual issue when using my keyboard. And they're like soft on the touch, I really like that. I really liked the look of the MOA profile, and I think they're comfortable in general, especially when playing Tetris - my fingers sit on them seemingly flawlessly.\n\nNot on the sound test video but basically the numpad has a clacky sound in addition. Not (very) loud, especially how I'll almost only use it on Blender, pressing one specific key before I move back to the other keyboard or my mouse.\n\nInserting the keycaps on slot with stabalizers... For the stubborn ones (the enter key being the worst offender) - and I'll admit I don't know if it even actually worked or I was just lucky (I was past at my sleep schedule at that point lmao), I was raising and centering the cross thingies, then have the respective keyboard upside down with my hand (or arm, 1kg keyboard lmao), and insert they keycap in. I had to do all that process more than once with a couple of keycaps, but I did manage to make sure the stabalizers actually do their job.\n\nI have two PCs (a tower, and a tiny Single Board Computer), so the wireless features on both keyboards are reeeeally comfortable for me. I don't mind the keyboard's weight when I have to take out my graphics tablet, my desk is big enough to move around everything I need.",

Ideally I don't want to print up a board for this, and would really just like to have flying leads to my IO breakout. \n\nI'm really struggling to get leads to stick to the pins without them oxidising, melting... If it were a few switches I could just about do it, but getting 12 to stick is becoming challenging, and I fear for the longevity of it.\n\nChatGPT seemed to suggest there were keyswitches available with flying leads in place, but I have a strong suspicion its hallucinating given I can't find a single one. Getting a PCB printed is going to be expensive (and I'm already into the too much time / money sunk on random bits stage).\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas or experience in how to reliably connect to the switches? I was hoping I could crimp Dupont style connectors to them, but it seems risky (large moment of force on the thin legs) and theres not much vertical space.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4djk5f1j7avf1.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=d690575f4cfb23c6db93e1b3879d37c69b689d97\n\n  \n",

It works again.  \n\\- brought it home, the thing works well... until it goes into sleep mode.  \n\\- after waking up from sleep mode, nothing works. Have to open the whole thing and close it.... and it works  again... until it falls asleep.\n\nIdk how to convince this retailer to swap me a new one. They keep trying to fix it. I don't think they have a refund policy. I'm so tired of this piece of modern technology. I have brought it to the shop 5 times and there's going to be a 6th for this new sleep issue. And maybe on the 2nd month it will invent itself another issue\n\nImo it is the best sounding paperweight I have had, not a functioning keyboard though",

    "title": "4x10 Ortho Handwire",
    "selftext": "It’s so little!\n\nIn my ongoing quest to have all the orthos, I present my 4x10 entry. \n\nI had always been leery of qaz layouts, while I am comfortable working with layers going from 12 to 10 columns and dropping most of the modifiers into layers just seemed like a bridge too far. But, it is a logical step from planckland, so I decided to dig into it. \n\nSurprisingly, what I discovered when planning keymaps is that I really don’t need that many modifiers for normal typing, and the ones I need most fit along the bottom row just fine, making the layered modifiers really more of a matter of tucking away things I don’t use a lot anyway. That said, this is the first layout I have done with two essential layers - usually I can get the rest of the keys onto a single layer when laying out a 40, but this one does need an up and a down.\n\nIt’s not daily driver material, but it’s a nice change of pace keyboard and it has a singular spot in my collection.\n\nAlso, it’s the first linear switch keyboard I’ve made since the first mechanical keyboard I ever had. I had some magic girl switches I had bought thinking they were tactiles like my magic girl darks, but buyer beware. I figured I would use them eventually. They’re a little scratchy but they are a good weight. Also the housing color was a really good fit for the rest of the build, which counts for more than I like to admit on my visible handwires.\n\nAnyway, the case is printed parts from an open source design I found on github called the banime. I was inspired to do this build by the acai, but I didn’t find any case files for it directly and this was my favorite alternative design. The little mcu cutout is a handy bit when trying to squeeze in all those wires. I sent the body away to be resin printed in china. These cost a lot now but they’re still 1/3 to 1/4 of getting the same material domestically. Still, I can’t go buying too many, my next couple of projects are stacked acryllic cases I can get locally. \n\nMcu is a helios, the best rp2040 mcu for the money. The cheap ones are tempting, but only the helios and the wisdpi tiny seem to be consistently free from annoying quirks and defects in the pro micro form factor rp2040 world - I usually use rp2040 because I have a lot of working code to riff on and because I like their bootloader method the most.\n\nCaps are drop mt3 fairlanes. I didn’t love these in person as much as I did online. The legend contrast on the alphas is annoyingly low, but this seems to be the build that they finally gelled with. \n\nWiring is vanilla, no weird science this time out. The layout is this one’s trick.\n\nMy next ortho on the desk will probably be a 4x13 I found recently that’s squeezed into a 12.75 wide minivan case. I am running out of new layouts until I learn to do the CAD to make my own cases - at which point I’m doing the 6x10 ortho you didn’t know you needed.",

    "title": "[RULES UPDATE] Media Only Post, Typing Apps, Games, and Extensions, Combatting Spam",
    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI have posted this to Geek Hack also, but it's been over a week and my post has not been approved. I messaged the moderator of the Geek Hack interest checked forums, and they have not replied yet. So I thought I would make this post here also.\n\nI've got the prototype complete. If you guys have any suggestions of where I should sell this or if anyone would like to partner with me, please let me know.\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**ANSI60**\n\nA 4mm keyboard plate with multiple layout support.\n\n**Supported Layouts**\n\n* Split Backspace\n* Split Right Shift\n* Stepped Caps Lock\n* 7u Spacebar\n\n[Supported Layouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YHOHfZDZJXJPjWIfWgxHSUXzf9Ksx9y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Aluminum\n* Polycarbonate (PC)\n\n**Compatibility**\n\n* **Mounting styles:** Tray Mount\n* **Form factor:** 60% ANSI\n\n**Supported PCBs**\n\n* Venom HE 60% PCB\n* GH60 and DZ60 variants\n* Wooting 60HE\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**Introduction / Vision**\n\nIntroducing the **ANSI60** — a 4mm keyboard plate crafted for enthusiasts seeking to push the boundaries of typing acoustics and feel.   \nAt nearly three times the thickness of a standard 1.5mm plate, the ANSI60 transforms vibrational behavior, producing a crisper, more rounded tone with a fuller frequency response across the sound spectrum.\n\nMore than just thicker — the ANSI60 delivers a distinct typing experience unlike standard 1.5mm plates. With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested. We’re ready to place a bulk order and are gauging demand to lock quantities, materials, and colors.\n\nIf you’re interested—and open to a small preorder discount—please:  \n• Fill the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA)  \n• Join the [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/74VFKHyb)  \n• Or comment below\n\n**Discord to follow updates:** [Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/74VFKHyb)  \n**IC Form:** [Fill out the IC form](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA)\n\n[Full Album of Pictures and Videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EHXKIb6Zt4SlKxnAtUhdXVVJU-BShbJT?usp=sharing)",

    "title": "HMX Firecracker has tickled a weird part of my brain and I may never recover: a review.",
    "selftext": "First and foremost - I'm a tactile switch lover through and through. I've tried a fair number this year, the most recent being the Sillyworks x Gateron Type R. I've tried both more budget options (I see you Akko V3 Cream Blue Pro!) and more premium offerings like the Drop x Invyr Holy Pandas. I've spent too much money but honestly I no longer care because I may have found IT. The one. Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

Here's the link for F108 Pro (you can search for the others on their site):\n\n[https://aulakeyboard.com/product/aula-f108-pro/](https://aulakeyboard.com/product/aula-f108-pro/)\n\nThere's Keychron Q6, but I hate the knob position:\n\n[https://keychron.net.br/pt/products/keychron-q6-qmk-tecladomecanicopersonalizado?srsltid=AfmBOoqCbCbC18iLNDkQEUTDxdqPd9j0wFKEN5vK5Mus2kB85GjmFlEV](https://keychron.net.br/pt/products/keychron-q6-qmk-tecladomecanicopersonalizado?srsltid=AfmBOoqCbCbC18iLNDkQEUTDxdqPd9j0wFKEN5vK5Mus2kB85GjmFlEV)\n\nThen if you're a rich guy you can customize a GMMK Pro (U$ 500+):\n\n[https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/gmmk-3-configurator?step=1&language=English+%28US%29&size=100%25&connectivity=Wired&configSwitchTechnology=Standard+Hotswap+%28MX%29&configPcbOrientation=North-facing&configLayout=ANSI&bottomCase=Black&topCase=Black&switches=Fox+Ultralight+MX&keycaps=Classic+Black&os=Windows&badge=Black&rotaryKnob=Jet+Black&cable=Standard+Black&gasketModules=Firm+%28Silicone%29&switchPlate=Silver+Aluminum&defaults.keycaps=Backlit+Black&defaults.bottomCase=Black%2CJet+Black](https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/gmmk-3-configurator?step=1&language=English+%28US%29&size=100%25&connectivity=Wired&configSwitchTechnology=Standard+Hotswap+%28MX%29&configPcbOrientation=North-facing&configLayout=ANSI&bottomCase=Black&topCase=Black&switches=Fox+Ultralight+MX&keycaps=Classic+Black&os=Windows&badge=Black&rotaryKnob=Jet+Black&cable=Standard+Black&gasketModules=Firm+%28Silicone%29&switchPlate=Silver+Aluminum&defaults.keycaps=Backlit+Black&defaults.bottomCase=Black%2CJet+Black)\n\n**If you don't need hotswap**\n\nThen there's plenty of options. But I really want hotswap. Here's some of them. I won't link all link, just look for them:\n\nDas Keyboard (several)\n\nSpectre Pro\n\nSteelseries Apex\n\nMountain Everest\n\nThermaltake (several)\n\nMajestouch ninja\n\nLeopold (several)\n\nCoolmaster (several)\n\nCherry keyboards (several)\n\nAdesso (several)\n\niONE Scorpius\n\nLogitech K845\n\nMax Keyboard\n\nTurtle Beach (several)\n\nRosewill (several) speacially Neon K90\n\nCougar Attack X3",

    "title": "OLED or MINI LED IPS?",
    "selftext": "Hi, I am currently deciding on a new monitor. I currently have a 27inch, 1440p, 95hz 350nit brightness IPS. My hardware driving it is an an XBOX series X, occasional mid laptop and a PC with a 7800x3d and a rx 7900 xtx. I am also based in the UK.\n\nI am looking for a new monitor (with the existing becoming a secondary portrait), that is 32 inch (so I can sit further back and push it deeper on my desk and ultimately for a more cinematic experience). I am gonna go for a 4k panel for an increase in pixel density (especially in the case of OLEDs odd text clarity).\n\nRefresh rate I am a bit blasé about, anything 120hz and above is fine, obviously higher is better.\n\nFor IO HDMI 2.1 is required and ideally id like DP2.1 UBHR 13.5 and higher (Unless someone can make a really good case for something out that is otherwise good), assuming the refresh rate goes much over 120hz. Also USB C with alt mode and atleast 65w charging (not that pitiful shite like 15w).\n\nBudget max of like £1000 but less is ideal. Usage case is like 70% gaming/content 30% working changing at some sections of the to 95% gaming and content and 5% work.\n\nThe choice in my mind really comes down to QD OLED or IPS Mini LED, OLED has superior uniformity, contrast, viewing angles and motion handing; where as Mini LED has brightness.\n\nMy sticking point is that my existing IPS is quite bright and getting a dimmer OLED my look disappointing as well as not particularly bright HDR performance. But Mini LED IPS has blooming, poorer motion handing, uniformity, possible light bleed (big turn off but should be negated by local dimming although it could be an issue). Also aesthetically OLED's look nicer. My environment also changes some what, sometimes I am using my set up in the middle if the day, so bright room, especially come summer, not too good for glossy QD OLEDs, but at the same time I play in the dark for a while where QD OLED is in its element, and then some times with a lamp on which I am unsure as to how QD will look then, either way I could encounter reflections or black raise.\n\nFor some context I am looking at the gigabyte aorus 31.5\" fo32u2p and the benq mobiuz ex321ux. The OLED is cheaper, another of my criticisms with the Mini LED is its high pricing for what it is. I am aware of the Samsung neo G8 but with it being a VA panel with piss poor viewing angles I am not particularly interested.\n\nI have also looked at WOLED's but they have worse text clarity in comparison to both IPS and QD OLED and most seem to be DP 1.4 and matt (I prefer the idea of glossy for the clarity).\n\nI am aware of newer brighter panels for OLED but they seem to be constrained to 27 inch panels, I am sure theyt will come out but they will probably be 8 months off and I can't really be bother; if OLED was SDR 300nits and HDR true black 500, the choice would be vastly easier.

Also know that 2K is supposed to be a 27 inch for best results, is it a good brand as well? Thanks",

    "title": "KTC M27T6 vs. AOC Q27G3XMN Review",
    "selftext": "Hey folks, I recently bought the KTC M27T6 and I have the AOC Q27G3XMN (the latter I have for about half a year), so I thought I make a quick review and comparison, as those are two of the main competitors in the low budget HDR Mini-LED Market. Especially in Europe where the G40XMN (or how its called) won't be sold, for whatever reason. I will not get too much into the technical site of things like color gamut or anything, take this review as one made by a standard gamer, not a monitor enthusiast. Displayninja has a more in depth review.\n\n**TLDR:**  \nI prefer the KTC. It has a few weakpoints, mainly slightly more visible ghosting in the UFO-Test and a really slight vignette on the edges against white Websites etc. Both of those are not noticeable while gaming. The HDR is way better than on the AOC with way less hastle. Local Dimming is also better. \n\n**My Demands:**  \nI built a new gaming PC after \\~10 Years. It has a 9070XT and I want to play with decent FPS but with very high graphic settings, I actually like Raytraycing. At 27\" 1440p is the best choice for me. I care about colors, blacks and highlights in games, but I also work quite a lot from home, so an OLED is not for me. My prior monitors where some old chunky 1080p 1900x1200 TN Panels. I am not really sensible to black smearing I think, I tried to see it but It never bothers me and I actually don't really see it.\n\n**Decision Process:**  \nStarting out, I watched a lot of reviews from Monitors Unboxed and RTINGS. I first got a good Fast IPS Panel from MSI. Cyberpunk seemed breathtaking at first, the city was vivid and the colors popped. But then it got to nighttime... And the edges where glowing. I thought it was because of too much light in my room, but yeah it was just IPS glow. This was something I couldn't bring myself to like, so I ordered the AOC and after some back and forth I sent the MSI back. My reasoning was: no backlight bleed, better HDR in theory, good text clarity and I thought I will get this as a interim monitor until the technology gets better. I know that the Xiaomi exists as well, but I heard that this has bad firmware and a few other problems, with no way of updating and I didn't want to gamble on the firmware version.\n\n**The AOC:**  \nThis monitor was not that great out of the box. It had a red tint, so had to calibrate to monitor, to some recommendations by a redditor. HDR just looked washed out. I was honestly pretty disappointed at first. The SDR mode looked pretty good after some calibrating, and it obviously doesn't have the bleeding problem. That's why I kept it.   \nMy solution to the HDR was using the \"vivid games\" setting in the AMD Drivers for specific games, that I played with HDR. Because otherwise these would be too unsaturated and looked as if they had a grey/beige film over them. With those settings the games looked pretty good in HDR. After those steps the monitor was good to use. But getting there was a pain, the OSD is okay in itself but navigating with those buttons is shit.   \nAnother Problem I just ended up accepting with was the VRR-Flicker against blue(-ish) backgrounds. This was not really fixable for me. In some games it could be fixed with setting the monitor to a lower framerate in the windows settings. In other games it wasn't fixable at all. As I didn't want to go into those settings every time I just accepted it. One thing I noticed when comparing the HDR performance in HDR videos to the KTC is that the dimming algorithm doesn't seem to be as good. There where often some back-led ever so slightly visible, which bothered me. Also blooming is a bit of an issue, which is. to be expected with 356 or so dimming zones.\n\nOverall the AOC provided me with a pretty good HDR experience once I finished a long calibration and troubleshooting process. Though it was never perfect.\n\n**The KTC:**  \nI didn't know about the two Mini-LED KTC monitors up until last week. I knew that KTC is not the most reputable brand, but that they are OEM-Manufacture for bigger brands, so they know a thing or two about building monitors. I don't really care about all of that though. I saw that the KTC was on sale at the prime sale in Germany for 250€, which is 80€ less than I paid for the AOC. I quickly read some reviews, which there are pretty few of and decided to take the risk. As is seemed to improve on the AOC as well as the Xiaomi (it has a USB port for updates).  \nSetting it up was pretty easy. I set up the brightness to my preferred setting, lowered the black equalizer, for better contrasts and set HDR to DisplayHDR. Navigating the OSD is way more intuitive, due to the joystick-like controls. I then launched Cyberpunk and was pretty horrified, why do all my colors look like a unicorn puked on my monitor? Remembered that I had to turn on the vivid games setting. Turned that off and well, thats how HDR is supposed to look like. It was way better than the AOC. Also in other games like Jedi: Survivor and BF6 HDR looked just way better. Highlights were great and the blacks as well. And: I don't have any VRR-Flicker. I can just set the monitor to 180Hz with VRR and don't think about it, what a feeling! Blooming in HDR content is also noticeably reduced. So all in all HDR is just great on this monitor and significantly better compared to the AOC.  \nIt is not just perfect though. When working on the screen I noticed a slight vignette-like effect on the edges, which changes depending on the viewing angle. Its like 2-3 pixels wide and only really visible against white backgrounds/websites. While gaming I don't notice it at all. Also it was a slight bit worse with ghosting in the UFO-Test compared to the AOC. Something that is noticeable in a controlled test, like the UFO-Test but also not at all noticeable when gaming or watching content or using it in any other way.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI am really happy with the KTC it improves on the worst aspects of the AOC but also improves the points, where the AOC was also good to begin with. Mainly the HDR performance is way better, VRR-Flicker is not problem for me and it's cheaper as well. For me, my preferences and use cases it's just a more polished and hassle free experience. Even though it has some drawbacks, I would recommend this monitor over the AOC for people who want a good and affordable HDR experience and also for people who want to get into Mini-LED to get rid of their IPS glow.   \nThe third group that will enjoy this monitor are the ones that want a Mini-LED now and maybe wait for the bigger brands like ASUS, Samsung, LG etc. to launch better and more polished products compared to the AOC and the KTC, which will inevitably happen at some point. It feels good to spend 250-270€ (which it usually costs with an amazon coupon in Germany) on a monitor that performs really well now, as it is also viable to upgrade once something better launches and use this monitor as a second screen. But for now I'm set (the AOC is my second screen). ",

The second LG monitor was a godsend because I could actually see if I was typing in a password field or not. \n\n  \nI've built a couple PCs as well while having this Acer monitor, and when it comes time to test if the machine POSTs, or get to BIOS or install a new OS or whatever, I gotta hook up to the LG monitor. I was just setting up a new PC in my partner's office, who also has an Acer monitor, and spend an hour trying to figure out why windows wasn't booting until I heard the windows \"disconnect device\" sound come from the speakers on a machine I hadn't even thought was POSTing. Oh shit, of course, Acer monitor.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently moved to a new place for a new job and I’m still setting up my apartment. One of the first things I want to get is a monitor that can work well for both productivity and gaming.\n\nHere’s my setup and what I’m looking for:\n\n* I have two laptops:\n   * A Legion 5 Pro (2021) gaming laptop (slightly old, but I mostly play FIFA on it; runs fine on low settings).\n   * A work laptop that I’ll use 8-9 hours a day for coding, documentation, and meetings.\n* I want a monitor that I can easily switch between both laptops (for example, one on HDMI, one on USB-C or DisplayPort).\n* I also plan to buy a PS5 soon, so I’d love a monitor that would be great for consoles too.\n\nI’m looking for something in the 27\"-32\" range. I’ll mostly use it for work during the day and for gaming/content (movies, YouTube, etc.) after hours.\n\nI was eyeing some OLED models but I’m a bit concerned about burn-in since the monitor will be on for long workdays. If OLED isn’t ideal for my use case, I’m open to high-quality IPS or VA panels too.\n\n**Budget:** Having a hard deciding this. On one hand, I do not want to spend much but on the other, I feel like it's a one-time investment for a long time and it does boost productivity too. Also, having experienced some high-end QLED TVs before, I am not easily impressed by displays.\n\nWould love recommendations or personal experiences with monitors that fit this mix of work + gaming + console use.\n\n**TL;DR: my main questions:**\n\n1. What panel type should I go for (OLED vs IPS vs VA)?\n2. Do OLED panels still have noticeable burn-in risk in 2025 for all-day work use?\n3. What resolution makes the most sense, is 4K worth it, or is QHD good enough?\n4. If I had to trade off quality to save money, is it better to go for QHD on a better panel or 4K on a worse one?\n5. Should I consider a dual-monitor setup, one for gaming/content and a cheaper one for static work tasks?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

    "title": "KTC M27T6 vs. AOC Q27G3XMN Review",
    "selftext": "Hey folks, I recently bought the KTC M27T6 and I have the AOC Q27G3XMN (the latter I have for about half a year), so I thought I make a quick review and comparison, as those are two of the main competitors in the low budget HDR Mini-LED Market. Especially in Europe where the G40XMN (or how its called) won't be sold, for whatever reason. I will not get too much into the technical site of things like color gamut or anything, take this review as one made by a standard gamer, not a monitor enthusiast. Displayninja has a more in depth review.\n\n**TLDR:**  \nI prefer the KTC. It has a few weakpoints, mainly slightly more visible ghosting in the UFO-Test and a really slight vignette on the edges against white Websites etc. Both of those are not noticeable while gaming. The HDR is way better than on the AOC with way less hastle. Local Dimming is also better. \n\n**My Demands:**  \nI built a new gaming PC after \\~10 Years. It has a 9070XT and I want to play with decent FPS but with very high graphic settings, I actually like Raytraycing. At 27\" 1440p is the best choice for me. I care about colors, blacks and highlights in games, but I also work quite a lot from home, so an OLED is not for me. My prior monitors where some old chunky 1080p 1900x1200 TN Panels. I am not really sensible to black smearing I think, I tried to see it but It never bothers me and I actually don't really see it.\n\n**Decision Process:**  \nStarting out, I watched a lot of reviews from Monitors Unboxed and RTINGS. I first got a good Fast IPS Panel from MSI. Cyberpunk seemed breathtaking at first, the city was vivid and the colors popped. But then it got to nighttime... And the edges where glowing. I thought it was because of too much light in my room, but yeah it was just IPS glow. This was something I couldn't bring myself to like, so I ordered the AOC and after some back and forth I sent the MSI back. My reasoning was: no backlight bleed, better HDR in theory, good text clarity and I thought I will get this as a interim monitor until the technology gets better. I know that the Xiaomi exists as well, but I heard that this has bad firmware and a few other problems, with no way of updating and I didn't want to gamble on the firmware version.\n\n**The AOC:**  \nThis monitor was not that great out of the box. It had a red tint, so had to calibrate to monitor, to some recommendations by a redditor. HDR just looked washed out. I was honestly pretty disappointed at first. The SDR mode looked pretty good after some calibrating, and it obviously doesn't have the bleeding problem. That's why I kept it.   \nMy solution to the HDR was using the \"vivid games\" setting in the AMD Drivers for specific games, that I played with HDR. Because otherwise these would be too unsaturated and looked as if they had a grey/beige film over them. With those settings the games looked pretty good in HDR. After those steps the monitor was good to use. But getting there was a pain, the OSD is okay in itself but navigating with those buttons is shit.   \nAnother Problem I just ended up accepting with was the VRR-Flicker against blue(-ish) backgrounds. This was not really fixable for me. In some games it could be fixed with setting the monitor to a lower framerate in the windows settings. In other games it wasn't fixable at all. As I didn't want to go into those settings every time I just accepted it. One thing I noticed when comparing the HDR performance in HDR videos to the KTC is that the dimming algorithm doesn't seem to be as good. There where often some back-led ever so slightly visible, which bothered me. Also blooming is a bit of an issue, which is. to be expected with 356 or so dimming zones.\n\nOverall the AOC provided me with a pretty good HDR experience once I finished a long calibration and troubleshooting process. Though it was never perfect.\n\n**The KTC:**  \nI didn't know about the two Mini-LED KTC monitors up until last week. I knew that KTC is not the most reputable brand, but that they are OEM-Manufacture for bigger brands, so they know a thing or two about building monitors. I don't really care about all of that though. I saw that the KTC was on sale at the prime sale in Germany for 250€, which is 80€ less than I paid for the AOC. I quickly read some reviews, which there are pretty few of and decided to take the risk. As is seemed to improve on the AOC as well as the Xiaomi (it has a USB port for updates).  \nSetting it up was pretty easy. I set up the brightness to my preferred setting, lowered the black equalizer, for better contrasts and set HDR to DisplayHDR. Navigating the OSD is way more intuitive, due to the joystick-like controls. I then launched Cyberpunk and was pretty horrified, why do all my colors look like a unicorn puked on my monitor? Remembered that I had to turn on the vivid games setting. Turned that off and well, thats how HDR is supposed to look like. It was way better than the AOC. Also in other games like Jedi: Survivor and BF6 HDR looked just way better. Highlights were great and the blacks as well. And: I don't have any VRR-Flicker. I can just set the monitor to 180Hz with VRR and don't think about it, what a feeling! Blooming in HDR content is also noticeably reduced. So all in all HDR is just great on this monitor and significantly better compared to the AOC.  \nIt is not just perfect though. When working on the screen I noticed a slight vignette-like effect on the edges, which changes depending on the viewing angle. Its like 2-3 pixels wide and only really visible against white backgrounds/websites. While gaming I don't notice it at all. Also it was a slight bit worse with ghosting in the UFO-Test compared to the AOC. Something that is noticeable in a controlled test, like the UFO-Test but also not at all noticeable when gaming or watching content or using it in any other way.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI am really happy with the KTC it improves on the worst aspects of the AOC but also improves the points, where the AOC was also good to begin with. Mainly the HDR performance is way better, VRR-Flicker is not problem for me and it's cheaper as well. For me, my preferences and use cases it's just a more polished and hassle free experience. Even though it has some drawbacks, I would recommend this monitor over the AOC for people who want a good and affordable HDR experience and also for people who want to get into Mini-LED to get rid of their IPS glow.   \nThe third group that will enjoy this monitor are the ones that want a Mini-LED now and maybe wait for the bigger brands like ASUS, Samsung, LG etc. to launch better and more polished products compared to the AOC and the KTC, which will inevitably happen at some point. It feels good to spend 250-270€ (which it usually costs with an amazon coupon in Germany) on a monitor that performs really well now, as it is also viable to upgrade once something better launches and use this monitor as a second screen. But for now I'm set (the AOC is my second screen). ",

    "title": "OLED or MINI LED IPS?",
    "selftext": "Hi, I am currently deciding on a new monitor. I currently have a 27inch, 1440p, 95hz 350nit brightness IPS. My hardware driving it is an an XBOX series X, occasional mid laptop and a PC with a 7800x3d and a rx 7900 xtx. I am also based in the UK.\n\nI am looking for a new monitor (with the existing becoming a secondary portrait), that is 32 inch (so I can sit further back and push it deeper on my desk and ultimately for a more cinematic experience). I am gonna go for a 4k panel for an increase in pixel density (especially in the case of OLEDs odd text clarity).\n\nRefresh rate I am a bit blasé about, anything 120hz and above is fine, obviously higher is better.\n\nFor IO HDMI 2.1 is required and ideally id like DP2.1 UBHR 13.5 and higher (Unless someone can make a really good case for something out that is otherwise good), assuming the refresh rate goes much over 120hz. Also USB C with alt mode and atleast 65w charging (not that pitiful shite like 15w).\n\nBudget max of like £1000 but less is ideal. Usage case is like 70% gaming/content 30% working changing at some sections of the to 95% gaming and content and 5% work.\n\nThe choice in my mind really comes down to QD OLED or IPS Mini LED, OLED has superior uniformity, contrast, viewing angles and motion handing; where as Mini LED has brightness.\n\nMy sticking point is that my existing IPS is quite bright and getting a dimmer OLED my look disappointing as well as not particularly bright HDR performance. But Mini LED IPS has blooming, poorer motion handing, uniformity, possible light bleed (big turn off but should be negated by local dimming although it could be an issue). Also aesthetically OLED's look nicer. My environment also changes some what, sometimes I am using my set up in the middle if the day, so bright room, especially come summer, not too good for glossy QD OLEDs, but at the same time I play in the dark for a while where QD OLED is in its element, and then some times with a lamp on which I am unsure as to how QD will look then, either way I could encounter reflections or black raise.\n\nFor some context I am looking at the gigabyte aorus 31.5\" fo32u2p and the benq mobiuz ex321ux. The OLED is cheaper, another of my criticisms with the Mini LED is its high pricing for what it is. I am aware of the Samsung neo G8 but with it being a VA panel with piss poor viewing angles I am not particularly interested.\n\nI have also looked at WOLED's but they have worse text clarity in comparison to both IPS and QD OLED and most seem to be DP 1.4 and matt (I prefer the idea of glossy for the clarity).\n\nI am aware of newer brighter panels for OLED but they seem to be constrained to 27 inch panels, I am sure theyt will come out but they will probably be 8 months off and I can't really be bother; if OLED was SDR 300nits and HDR true black 500, the choice would be vastly easier.

    "title": "KTC M27T6 vs. AOC Q27G3XMN Review",
    "selftext": "Hey folks, I recently bought the KTC M27T6 and I have the AOC Q27G3XMN (the latter I have for about half a year), so I thought I make a quick review and comparison, as those are two of the main competitors in the low budget HDR Mini-LED Market. Especially in Europe where the G40XMN (or how its called) won't be sold, for whatever reason. I will not get too much into the technical site of things like color gamut or anything, take this review as one made by a standard gamer, not a monitor enthusiast. Displayninja has a more in depth review.\n\n**TLDR:**  \nI prefer the KTC. It has a few weakpoints, mainly slightly more visible ghosting in the UFO-Test and a really slight vignette on the edges against white Websites etc. Both of those are not noticeable while gaming. The HDR is way better than on the AOC with way less hastle. Local Dimming is also better. \n\n**My Demands:**  \nI built a new gaming PC after \\~10 Years. It has a 9070XT and I want to play with decent FPS but with very high graphic settings, I actually like Raytraycing. At 27\" 1440p is the best choice for me. I care about colors, blacks and highlights in games, but I also work quite a lot from home, so an OLED is not for me. My prior monitors where some old chunky 1080p 1900x1200 TN Panels. I am not really sensible to black smearing I think, I tried to see it but It never bothers me and I actually don't really see it.\n\n**Decision Process:**  \nStarting out, I watched a lot of reviews from Monitors Unboxed and RTINGS. I first got a good Fast IPS Panel from MSI. Cyberpunk seemed breathtaking at first, the city was vivid and the colors popped. But then it got to nighttime... And the edges where glowing. I thought it was because of too much light in my room, but yeah it was just IPS glow. This was something I couldn't bring myself to like, so I ordered the AOC and after some back and forth I sent the MSI back. My reasoning was: no backlight bleed, better HDR in theory, good text clarity and I thought I will get this as a interim monitor until the technology gets better. I know that the Xiaomi exists as well, but I heard that this has bad firmware and a few other problems, with no way of updating and I didn't want to gamble on the firmware version.\n\n**The AOC:**  \nThis monitor was not that great out of the box. It had a red tint, so had to calibrate to monitor, to some recommendations by a redditor. HDR just looked washed out. I was honestly pretty disappointed at first. The SDR mode looked pretty good after some calibrating, and it obviously doesn't have the bleeding problem. That's why I kept it.   \nMy solution to the HDR was using the \"vivid games\" setting in the AMD Drivers for specific games, that I played with HDR. Because otherwise these would be too unsaturated and looked as if they had a grey/beige film over them. With those settings the games looked pretty good in HDR. After those steps the monitor was good to use. But getting there was a pain, the OSD is okay in itself but navigating with those buttons is shit.   \nAnother Problem I just ended up accepting with was the VRR-Flicker against blue(-ish) backgrounds. This was not really fixable for me. In some games it could be fixed with setting the monitor to a lower framerate in the windows settings. In other games it wasn't fixable at all. As I didn't want to go into those settings every time I just accepted it. One thing I noticed when comparing the HDR performance in HDR videos to the KTC is that the dimming algorithm doesn't seem to be as good. There where often some back-led ever so slightly visible, which bothered me. Also blooming is a bit of an issue, which is. to be expected with 356 or so dimming zones.\n\nOverall the AOC provided me with a pretty good HDR experience once I finished a long calibration and troubleshooting process. Though it was never perfect.\n\n**The KTC:**  \nI didn't know about the two Mini-LED KTC monitors up until last week. I knew that KTC is not the most reputable brand, but that they are OEM-Manufacture for bigger brands, so they know a thing or two about building monitors. I don't really care about all of that though. I saw that the KTC was on sale at the prime sale in Germany for 250€, which is 80€ less than I paid for the AOC. I quickly read some reviews, which there are pretty few of and decided to take the risk. As is seemed to improve on the AOC as well as the Xiaomi (it has a USB port for updates).  \nSetting it up was pretty easy. I set up the brightness to my preferred setting, lowered the black equalizer, for better contrasts and set HDR to DisplayHDR. Navigating the OSD is way more intuitive, due to the joystick-like controls. I then launched Cyberpunk and was pretty horrified, why do all my colors look like a unicorn puked on my monitor? Remembered that I had to turn on the vivid games setting. Turned that off and well, thats how HDR is supposed to look like. It was way better than the AOC. Also in other games like Jedi: Survivor and BF6 HDR looked just way better. Highlights were great and the blacks as well. And: I don't have any VRR-Flicker. I can just set the monitor to 180Hz with VRR and don't think about it, what a feeling! Blooming in HDR content is also noticeably reduced. So all in all HDR is just great on this monitor and significantly better compared to the AOC.  \nIt is not just perfect though. When working on the screen I noticed a slight vignette-like effect on the edges, which changes depending on the viewing angle. Its like 2-3 pixels wide and only really visible against white backgrounds/websites. While gaming I don't notice it at all. Also it was a slight bit worse with ghosting in the UFO-Test compared to the AOC. Something that is noticeable in a controlled test, like the UFO-Test but also not at all noticeable when gaming or watching content or using it in any other way.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI am really happy with the KTC it improves on the worst aspects of the AOC but also improves the points, where the AOC was also good to begin with. Mainly the HDR performance is way better, VRR-Flicker is not problem for me and it's cheaper as well. For me, my preferences and use cases it's just a more polished and hassle free experience. Even though it has some drawbacks, I would recommend this monitor over the AOC for people who want a good and affordable HDR experience and also for people who want to get into Mini-LED to get rid of their IPS glow.   \nThe third group that will enjoy this monitor are the ones that want a Mini-LED now and maybe wait for the bigger brands like ASUS, Samsung, LG etc. to launch better and more polished products compared to the AOC and the KTC, which will inevitably happen at some point. It feels good to spend 250-270€ (which it usually costs with an amazon coupon in Germany) on a monitor that performs really well now, as it is also viable to upgrade once something better launches and use this monitor as a second screen. But for now I'm set (the AOC is my second screen). ",

    "title": "OLED or MINI LED IPS?",
    "selftext": "Hi, I am currently deciding on a new monitor. I currently have a 27inch, 1440p, 95hz 350nit brightness IPS. My hardware driving it is an an XBOX series X, occasional mid laptop and a PC with a 7800x3d and a rx 7900 xtx. I am also based in the UK.\n\nI am looking for a new monitor (with the existing becoming a secondary portrait), that is 32 inch (so I can sit further back and push it deeper on my desk and ultimately for a more cinematic experience). I am gonna go for a 4k panel for an increase in pixel density (especially in the case of OLEDs odd text clarity).\n\nRefresh rate I am a bit blasé about, anything 120hz and above is fine, obviously higher is better.\n\nFor IO HDMI 2.1 is required and ideally id like DP2.1 UBHR 13.5 and higher (Unless someone can make a really good case for something out that is otherwise good), assuming the refresh rate goes much over 120hz. Also USB C with alt mode and atleast 65w charging (not that pitiful shite like 15w).\n\nBudget max of like £1000 but less is ideal. Usage case is like 70% gaming/content 30% working changing at some sections of the to 95% gaming and content and 5% work.\n\nThe choice in my mind really comes down to QD OLED or IPS Mini LED, OLED has superior uniformity, contrast, viewing angles and motion handing; where as Mini LED has brightness.\n\nMy sticking point is that my existing IPS is quite bright and getting a dimmer OLED my look disappointing as well as not particularly bright HDR performance. But Mini LED IPS has blooming, poorer motion handing, uniformity, possible light bleed (big turn off but should be negated by local dimming although it could be an issue). Also aesthetically OLED's look nicer. My environment also changes some what, sometimes I am using my set up in the middle if the day, so bright room, especially come summer, not too good for glossy QD OLEDs, but at the same time I play in the dark for a while where QD OLED is in its element, and then some times with a lamp on which I am unsure as to how QD will look then, either way I could encounter reflections or black raise.\n\nFor some context I am looking at the gigabyte aorus 31.5\" fo32u2p and the benq mobiuz ex321ux. The OLED is cheaper, another of my criticisms with the Mini LED is its high pricing for what it is. I am aware of the Samsung neo G8 but with it being a VA panel with piss poor viewing angles I am not particularly interested.\n\nI have also looked at WOLED's but they have worse text clarity in comparison to both IPS and QD OLED and most seem to be DP 1.4 and matt (I prefer the idea of glossy for the clarity).\n\nI am aware of newer brighter panels for OLED but they seem to be constrained to 27 inch panels, I am sure theyt will come out but they will probably be 8 months off and I can't really be bother; if OLED was SDR 300nits and HDR true black 500, the choice would be vastly easier.

    "selftext": "So, I’ve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn’t stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it’s no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they’d be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they’re better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they’re still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I’m really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say “sufficient”) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an “active analog mode” which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you’re looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC… look no further!",

    "selftext": "This is my project headphone for my high school design course.\n\nIt needed to fit the following criteria:\n\n* comfortable for long hours with ultralight weight construction\n* sound quality on par with other reference/studio headphones\n* priced relatively affordable compared to the market\n\n**specs:**\n\n* Driver: Peerless 50 mm driver\n* mass: 170g (without cable)\n* materials:\n   * earcups: PLA-LW and PLA\n   * headband strap: Faux leather\n   * earpad: aliexpress 110mm hybrid velour\n   * everything else: PETG\n* Connection: dual 3.5mm\n\n**Comfort**\n\nBeing 170 grams already makes this a comfortable headphone; it feels weightless on the head. Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

The goal was just to prove the concept.\n\nThey’re also super light (25 grams), which is actually lighter than the cable itself 😄\n\nI’d love to hear what you think or answer any questions about the build!",

    "selftext": "I bought a VE Odo (25mw at 32ohms) a while back together with the Samson Sr950 (32ohms), the problem is my phone isn't able to power the Odo correctly probably due to some crappy Xiaomi limit (my phone is the Redmi Note 11, a 200 dollar phone from 2022). The Odo sounds weak compared when I use it on an Iphone 15. I was thinking a bluetooth receiver would be better since it powers itself with a battery and dongles aren't that comfortable to use too. The Fiio Btr11 is my first option as 20 dollars and 30mw at 32ohms. Would it make the Samsons sound good?",

    "title": "Had an opportunity to try the LCD-X, & my comparisons to the Edition XS.",
    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are— 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it—do yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

They do seem to make them a bit less toasty (which was not a problem, but was noticeable with the stock pads for me). They also change the frequency response a bit, tilt it a bit to the high end, and open it up slightly. Not an improvement, for me, I like the warm, slightly more intimate feel of the stock pads a bit better, but not something that would stop me from using these either. Sound is still great. Edit: I had said that the sound isolation was not as good, but I am going back and forth now, and really, it is about the same. Also, going back and forth between the two, the sound difference really is minimal - it is there, but less then my initial impression. I don't hear much of a difference in bass either. I think the sound changes a little as the pads warm up, maybe the seal becomes a little better, and the differences, which are not much to begin with, decrease.\n\n Wondering what peoples impressions are, if anyone is still using these on their Maxwell? I am contemplating whether to keep them or not.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say — these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural — vocals, instruments, bass — nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven’t noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it’s natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head — soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn’t use them for workouts (they’re not built for that kind of movement), but they’re fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal — so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you’re in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you’ve already paired — that’s super convenient. Battery life is great too — around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere’s also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I’ve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I’ve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They’re not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they’re absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

I’ve been using Astro A50s for a while they’re great for gaming, but man, they get super uncomfortable after like an hour.\n\nI’m totally new to the audiophile world, and holy hell, there are so many options. I had no clue where to start, so of course I did what any sane person would do I went to Reddit. I got a few a different suggestions but as I was searching through all of them I ended up looking up the Meze 109 pros and immediately fell in love with the looks. The wood finish on the cups matches my setup perfectly.\n\nSo I take the plunge — $800 on the 109 Pros and another $200 on a Topping DX3 Pro+. Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and… they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn’t notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I’d just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I’d give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two — same story. Day three, same thing at first… until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I’d never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I’m just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I’m not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

    "selftext": "First off, I am new to the headphone space so please excuse my lack of understanding.\n\nI have noticed that most reviewers, whether that's a review on YouTube, or an article on their website, place heavy emphasis on the frequency response curve. They will place this above all else when it comes to sound quality.\nFrom what I understand, frequency response curve is more indicative of a headphones 'sound signature' or what the manufacturer intended it to sound like but is not the only or imo main factor in the overall sound quality. \nFor example, when you compare a cheap pair of headphones to a more expensive one, no matter how well the cheap pair is tuned, it will still lack detail or resolution that the more expensive headphone will have (based on my experience). You might not hear the small variations in the artists vocals or the instruments. It can also lack clarity in the sound. \nSo, I feel, the frequency response curve is only one aspect of the overall sound quality, but there are many more things to consider and compare. You would expect an expensive pair of headphones to still sound 'better' even if it's not tuned closer to the Harman curve compared to a cheaper pair, just because of the better drivers, better materials and superior sound processing. \n\nIf so, why do reviews not talk about the rest of the factors affecting sound quality and focus almost purely on the sound signature, which to some extent can be fixed with an EQ, when the rest of it is not adjustable? \nSometimes they make it seem as if a well tuned $50 pair is better than a $400 pair which is better better build with better materials, with it's only shortcoming being a slightly worse tuning. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Or am I approaching this wrong?\nIs sound signature the defining factor in sound quality and listening experience or should we focus equally on things like clarity, resolution, ability to recreate the small variations in the sound, distortion?\nDo they avoid it because these other factors can't be quantified easily?

I found the ASH-IR-Dataset and just started messing with room impulse files. Then I tried one called Calypso, and that was the first time it actually felt like I was sitting in a room, not listening to a weird effect. The next game-changer was headphone correction. You have to EQ your headphones to a diffuse-field target first. It makes the headphones neutral for the simulation to work on.\n\nThat's when I found the ASH-Toolset. It took me literal days of tweaking to get a sound that wasn't just \"good\" but correct. You have to learn the settings because the defaults probably won't work for you. The most critical part is the HRTF dataset (the \"dummy head\" recordings). You have to test them all (KEMAR, KU 100, etc.) Your ears are physically unique. The HRTF that's perfect for me will sound weird and wrong to you. If you don't find the one that anatomically clicks with your brain, you will never get that true \"in front of you\" sound.\n\nFor the first time in my life, music is actually in front of me, originating from a point in space outside my head. I'm now listening to music I've ignored for years (acoustic, live concerts, old rock) and it's more engaging than the metal I've lived on for 5 years, because I can hear the actual space in the recording.

    "selftext": "Hello. Posting here cause headphone advice auto deleted this. :( \n\nI have the DT 1990 Pros (not MKII) currently, the left driver stopped working like a week ago or so. I decided to google what could be the cause, something led me to believe that the coil wire(?), the ultra thin varnished tiny wire was broken, so I opened it and sure enough it was. Replacement drivers are $192, I bought mine in 2022 for $550. New ones now cost $300\\~$350 depending on sales and such. So I was thinking is it even worth repairing at this point or just upgrade to better headphones. My choice that I landed on (kinda heavily at this stage) are the Meze 109 Pros. I am waiting for a sale for them as I've seen them as low as $628 or so, instead of the $750 they are right now (with coupon or something). I've seen a lot of reviews of these and lot's of people say these could be considered \"end game?\" for a lot of people. I am by no means an audiophile so fair enough in this case. Another thing I heard is the cable provided with these is kinda \"meh\" for the price of the headphones and suggestions seem to say to upgrade it. Not sure to what though. Any input is wholly welcomed. Thanks!\n\nBudget I'm hoping to stick under $800.\n\nMainly for listening to music or playing a few games like Rust and such\n\nI have the SMSL AO300 AMP\n\nAny input is wholly welcomed.

That’s it. The rest of the materials and build quality feel cheap as shit. Fit isn’t particularly comfortable either. The screw-in cable connectors make me question the design logic.  \nMaybe I’m just spoiled by Meze, but overall it feels far from premium.\n\n**Sound**\n\nTested on iBasso Nunchaku, Chord Mojo 2, Astell&Kern ACRO CA1000T, and Cayin HA-2A.  \nI don’t feel any difference between the gear, so don’t overpay for it.\n\nOverall, the sound is moderately detailed with good instrument separation —  \nan aggressive V-shape with some interesting midrange nuance.  \nThe louder it gets, the richer and denser it becomes.\n\n**Bass**:  \nStrong and plentiful, but not aggressive. Moderately textured, adds weight and body.  \nElectronic and hip-hop tracks sound fantastic.\n\n**Treble**:  \nThere’s a lot of it. Crisp, sometimes aggressive on cymbals — reminds me of the Meze 109 Pro.\n\n**Mids**:  \nThis is where it gets interesting. A&K seems to have borrowed Ultrasone’s S-Logic spatial trickery,  \nso vocals float “in the air”. When the music carries ambient layers or atmospheric elements, it’s genuinely captivating.\n\nOverall, the sound is unusual yet very pleasant — cohesive, engaging, and fun to listen to.\n\nPosting this because there are almost no reviews or proper FR measurements online.  \nIf you’re looking for something unique and a bit different, maybe this will help.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I need some advice from the Audeze experts here. I'm about to buy a used LCD-X and I'm confused about which version it is.\n\n**The Facts:**\n\n* Serial Number: **7526658**\n* Purchased new: **March 10, 2021** from xxxx (authorized Swiss dealer)\n* Original invoice included\n* Current asking price: **\\~€850)** \\- seems like a good deal\n\n**The Confusion:** According to what I found online, LCD-X units with serial numbers **7527600 or higher** should be the 2021 revision. This one is 7526658, so technically *below* that threshold.\n\n**BUT** \\- and this is where it gets interesting - **the headphone has ALL the 2021 visual characteristics:**\n\n* ✅ Modern suspension headband (not the old rigid design)\n* ✅ Metal mesh grills (not fabric)\n* ✅ New shiny leather earpads (not the old memory foam style)\n* ✅ Overall 2021 aesthetic\n\nThe seller confirms **everything is original** \\- nothing has been replaced or upgraded. He bought it exactly like this in March 2021.\n\n**My Theory:** Could this be an early 2021 production unit or a transition model for the European market? Maybe Audeze started the 2021 revision slightly before the \"official\" serial number threshold, especially for international markets?\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Has anyone seen LCD-X units with 2021 components but serial numbers below 7527600?\n2. Do you think this is actually a 2021 model that just happened to get an earlier serial number?\n3. At 850 EUROS with all 2021 components visible, is this a no-brainer purchase even if there's uncertainty?\n\nI've contacted Audeze support but thought I'd ask the community too. Any insights would be really appreciated!\n\n**TL;DR:** LCD-X serial 7526658 (below 2021 threshold) but has all 2021 physical features. Bought new March 2021. Is it a 2021 model? Worth buying at €850?",

    "title": "Trying to further my understanding of headphone power needs",
    "selftext": "I made a post in HeadohonesAdvice recently asking about the plausibility of running a pair of Sennheiser HD 600 off a dongle dac. At least half of the purpose of me asking is to learn more about the technical side of this audio technology, because I love learning and I have a strong desire to understand how things work. Having a strong base of knowledge can make me a more informed consumer if nothing else. \n\nThe responses ranged from “no dongle will really provide enough power to run those headphones properly, even if it sounds loud enough” to “amps are snake oil, don’t waste your money, just use an Apple dongle or, if you really want to blast it, get a fiio ka11 or something.”\n\nI found it truly interesting that both sides of this argument vehemently insist they are correct, which leads me to believe the science that goes into answering a question like this must be very nuanced and not at all black and white. \n\nStarting with the “why volume doesn’t always mean enough power” argument, the best explanation I could find is that dynamic drivers don’t have consistent voltage needs across the entire audio spectrum. More specifically, the bass and upper treble have more power needs, and that power form what I’ve gathered is voltage for volume and current for driver control. I may be oversimplifying or possibly just wrong so forgive me, but the broader point is that even if the sound in general sounds loud enough and is therefore getting enough power, parts of the frequency response might not be getting what they need especially when it comes to music with a lot of dynamic range or large peaks in volume. The idea here is that “it sounds loud enough to me” could be an incomplete picture. \n\nOn the other side of the argument I’m seeing that the above argument is a hypothetical and over complicated concern, that for a high-impedance set like the HD 600 if you can get it loud enough for normal listening then you are supplying it with all the power it needs since voltage equals volume and voltage is the main concern with a headphone like this (as opposed to a set that has low impedance but high current needs). Even Crinacle, a popular figure in the audiophile space, claims that something like the ka11 can provide “way too much power” and could easily run a set of HD 800s at “ear-splitting volume”.  Not that his word is gold, or anything, but he still strikes me as someone with a lot of experience and knowledge. \n\nMeanwhile back on the other side again, you can look up power calculators for headphones that more or less verify most dongles won’t be able to supply the necessary voltage or current for high impedance headphones to run at max potential/without clipping part of the frequency response. \n\nApologies for the wall of text here, I just wanted to provide context for the rabbit hole I’m going down. I should make it clear I’m not “worried” about this, I’m perfectly happy to enjoy my headphones and my music without wringing my hands worrying if I’m doing it properly. This is purely because I want to learn. I like learning. It’s that simple. And in service of that, I’d be interested to hear more detailed information on either side of this argument. Correct me where I’m wrong, elaborate where I’m oversimplifying, provide additional context I might not be considering. The folks here seem passionate and knowledgeable and I would be grateful if any of you would be willing to share your wisdom with me in the name of learning new things!",

Each has its own usecase, but I guess you get what I mean.\nI think that to me it mostly just makes me not wanna buy anything beyond the tier I’m currently at even though it can be pretty tempting to know what a really expensive pair can sound like and how much better sound can get, I just kinda know that even a 2,000$ pair would eventually just become normal!\nAm I making sense here?\n",

The execution was *very refined*, and I am left with thoughts in my head about how heated this 1000 dollar segment of open back market truly is. \n\nThe balance of weight (500g) by a very reliable strap mechanism that just makes Hifiman's Arya straps feel flimsy really comes to me immediately. The attention to detail really stood out. Dunu's only real flaw here with their beautiful built XLR and quarter inch cables (3.5mm entry at that, with the dual entries angled to the back, a classy decision) is the length being a bit unwieldy as with \"audiophile\" phones of ere. Would have liked to see Dunu flex their IEM cable mastery even more by featuring modular cable termination. \n\nThe presentation is not as \"in-your-face\" as with the DK3001BD Braindance, although the sub-bass and the bass made me think that this is what I'd get if I stick that 30ohm impedance adapter to the Braindance to lift the midbass on that divisive set of IEMs (which I adore).  The soundstage width is quite good, but depth is only mediocre. Feels like Dunu purposely put them just a touch out of focus, as they easily come into focus on a gentle EQ to Kemar DF target. You won't be as floored as with say Arya Organic in the sheer soundstage, but these aren't as closed as say Focal.\n\nWhen compared to what I have on hand, I think that their timbre is very natural and refined. The Utopia OG in comparison is immensely capable even with their passionate presentation as they boast even more accented macrodynamic with the \"slam\". The Noire X feel subdued and much more 'clinical'. HD800S and HD700 possess immense soundstage and separation, but they might be fatiguing in comparison to these.\n\nI have tried them with Qudelix-5k even just from the unbalanced 3.5mm, and with BTR17, but scaling to full sized amp such as K17/K19 is still recommended). I think what you use for a serious IEM amp setup will work beautifully with the Arashi. Don't use bottom rung amp and dac as you'd feel that you've cheated yourself from what these cans can do. \n\nThe Arashi isn't out to offend, and they can really be driven by portable source.  You can be very happy even just listening to Spotify and YouTube uploaded music with these, as the timbre with the finesse of the bass here make for very easy listen. \n\nYeah. Do color me greatly impressed. The finely controlled subbass to bass is the absolute star of the show here. ",

Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "title": "Today I have tried headphones I doubt I'll ever be able to afford - Sennheiser HD800S",
    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

    "selftext": "So, I’ve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn’t stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it’s no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they’d be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they’re better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they’re still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I’m really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say “sufficient”) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an “active analog mode” which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you’re looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC… look no further!",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are— 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it—do yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

I understand that, very very simply, the idea of higher impedance headphones is to allow higher fidelity if powered correctly. But would a somewhat lower 150 Ohm set like this still get a lot out of the WA3? I know I'm overcomplicating this since, yes, I do enjoy the sound quality as is, but would I make marked gains with something higher, like even a 300 Ohm HD 650? Thanks in advance.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say — these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural — vocals, instruments, bass — nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven’t noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it’s natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head — soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn’t use them for workouts (they’re not built for that kind of movement), but they’re fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal — so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you’re in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you’ve already paired — that’s super convenient. Battery life is great too — around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere’s also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I’ve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I’ve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They’re not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they’re absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

    "selftext": "So the last few weeks I’ve been hunting for my first pair of real headphones. I’ve been using Astro A50s for a while they’re great for gaming, but man, they get super uncomfortable after like an hour.\n\nI’m totally new to the audiophile world, and holy hell, there are so many options. I had no clue where to start, so of course I did what any sane person would do I went to Reddit. I got a few a different suggestions but as I was searching through all of them I ended up looking up the Meze 109 pros and immediately fell in love with the looks. The wood finish on the cups matches my setup perfectly.\n\nSo I take the plunge — $800 on the 109 Pros and another $200 on a Topping DX3 Pro+. Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and… they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn’t notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I’d just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I’d give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two — same story. Day three, same thing at first… until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I’d never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I’m just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I’m not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

Im sure people on here have 1000+$ headphones which easily out perform these, and that's fine, however these headphones feel like 1000$ headphones to me. \n\nMy dream after owning these and playing with these would be to own the full grado series... maybe one day.

They do seem to make them a bit less toasty (which was not a problem, but was noticeable with the stock pads for me). They also change the frequency response a bit, tilt it a bit to the high end, and open it up slightly. Not an improvement, for me, I like the warm, slightly more intimate feel of the stock pads a bit better, but not something that would stop me from using these either. Sound is still great. Edit: I had said that the sound isolation was not as good, but I am going back and forth now, and really, it is about the same. Also, going back and forth between the two, the sound difference really is minimal - it is there, but less then my initial impression. I don't hear much of a difference in bass either. I think the sound changes a little as the pads warm up, maybe the seal becomes a little better, and the differences, which are not much to begin with, decrease.\n\n Wondering what peoples impressions are, if anyone is still using these on their Maxwell? I am contemplating whether to keep them or not.",

    "selftext": "I've tried pretty much every \"spatial audio\" VST and DSP out there, and 99% of it is garbage. Just weird tricks that sound fake. Recently I learned about convolution. I found the ASH-IR-Dataset and just started messing with room impulse files. Then I tried one called Calypso, and that was the first time it actually felt like I was sitting in a room, not listening to a weird effect. The next game-changer was headphone correction. You have to EQ your headphones to a diffuse-field target first. It makes the headphones neutral for the simulation to work on.\n\nThat's when I found the ASH-Toolset. It took me literal days of tweaking to get a sound that wasn't just \"good\" but correct. You have to learn the settings because the defaults probably won't work for you. The most critical part is the HRTF dataset (the \"dummy head\" recordings). You have to test them all (KEMAR, KU 100, etc.) Your ears are physically unique. The HRTF that's perfect for me will sound weird and wrong to you. If you don't find the one that anatomically clicks with your brain, you will never get that true \"in front of you\" sound.\n\nFor the first time in my life, music is actually in front of me, originating from a point in space outside my head. I'm now listening to music I've ignored for years (acoustic, live concerts, old rock) and it's more engaging than the metal I've lived on for 5 years, because I can hear the actual space in the recording. The effect is insane on my IEMs, super precise and immersive. On my HD 650s, it's also incredible, but the sense of space is wider and less \"in your face,\" a totally different but equally cool vibe. If you're tired of the gimmicks and want to hear what's really possible, this is the way.\n\n(I don't know English well, so I apologize if something is written incorrectly.)\n\nupd: I wrote a short instruction on how to start using the dataset - [https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/)",

Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

The goal was just to prove the concept.\n\nThey’re also super light (25 grams), which is actually lighter than the cable itself 😄\n\nI’d love to hear what you think or answer any questions about the build!",

    "selftext": "So, I’ve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn’t stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it’s no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they’d be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they’re better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they’re still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I’m really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say “sufficient”) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an “active analog mode” which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you’re looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC… look no further!",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

Literally stood there with my mouth hanging open.\n\nThere were hundreds of headphones on display that day, but none of them came close to what the Grado delivered. The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are— 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it—do yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

It’s working great so far except one thing. \n\nMy question is why is it that when I hold down while doing my upward attack, it still does the upward attack, but when I hold up with my downward attack, it overrides the mapping and does an upward? The controls are mapped mirrored of each other, I don’t see any obvious reason why it would be the case that an up on the stick overrides the remap while a down on the stick doesn’t. I don’t know if this is game specific or something with the Deck’s controls. I just want to ask and see if there’s something obvious I’m missing. ",

    "selftext": "I’ve been thinking lately, what if Valve released a Steam Box that could finally eliminate the need for an Xbox entirely?\n\nHear me out: Xbox used to make sense because it was the most accessible way to enjoy high-quality gaming on a TV without building a PC. But now, with Steam’s massive library, regular sales, mod support, and the Steam Deck ecosystem, why not go all-in and make a console-style device for the living room?\n\nWhat My Version of the Steam Box Would Be:\n\nFull Steam Library Access:\n\nNo subscriptions needed, no artificial storefront limits. Just boot up and your entire Steam library is already there.\n\nCloud Sync with Steam Deck:\n\nSeamless cross-play with the Steam Deck. Start a game in your living room, pick it up on your Steam Deck on the go, progress synced instantly via Steam Cloud.\n\nGraphically Stronger Than Xbox:\n\nWith modern desktop GPU architecture, it could easily outperform the Xbox Series X. Even a mid-tier GPU like the RTX 4070/7800XT level would destroy a console in raw performance. Imagine Cyberpunk 2077 maxed out with mods in console form.\n\nMod Support on Console this alone would crush Xbox. Skyrim with full modding on a console? Baldur’s Gate 3 with community patches? Day 1 support for PC mods right from Steam Workshop.\n\nSteamOS with Big Picture Mode 2.0 A UI built for a controller-first experience. Simple, quick, customizable. No ads on the dashboard like Xbox and PlayStation love doing now.\n\nGame Streaming Integration Built-in support for:\n\nRemote Play\nNvidia GeForce Now\nXbox Game Pass (Cloud)\nMoonlight/Sunshine One box to unify ALL game libraries.\n\nMedia and Smart Home Friendly Support YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, Plex, and maybe even a home server mode for those who want to run NAS/media setups. \n\nWhy Xbox Would Be Useless After This:\n\nXbox’s main selling points today are:\n\nGame Pass (which you can already access via cloud/PC)\nAffordable hardware\nFamiliar controller ecosystem\n\nA Steam Box would counter all of that:\n✔ Way more games\n✔ Cheaper games thanks to Steam sales\n✔ Cloud sync with Steam Deck\n✔ Better performance\n✔ Mods\n✔ PC freedom with console simplicity\n\nXbox would honestly become irrelevant, Game Pass alone wouldn’t be enough to compete.",

When the steam deck first came out, I was excited like the rest of you. I somehow convinced myself from making the purchase when it first got released back in 2022. I have a beast of a PC, why would I need one? If I am going to be out and have extra time, I can just get some reading done instead of gaming.\n\nWell, now I am a mom and I figured I would treat myself to the OLED. My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby. Back to a time without all the responsibilities I carry now, I could have endlessly enjoyed the steam deck. I missed out on three years of being able to potato on the couch after a hard day at work. Before you weep for me, do not worry. I fully plan to own a steam deck for the rest of my life to make up for it.\n\nTL;DR: Buy a steam deck, and live a happy life.",

Some people might think this is terrorism to the Steam Deck because SteamOS was built specifically for gaming and it's the perfect software and I agree with that, but I want to be able to play Game Pass games while I still can (I don't think I will pay 30 bucks a month once this month finishes) and Minecraft with friends without the need to tinker with solutions that may or may not work. Also have in mind that if I do install Windows on it, I will also use it as a normal PC, as I have a dock, mouse and keyboard and some may say, \"Why don't you use your other pc, (because i have one), to do all of this?\" Well because when i bought my pc, i had little to no idea of pc parts and i got tremendously scammed, overpaying more than 400 euros for a shit box that's worth 200. Anyways, sorry for the long text and all critics and advices are welcome. Thanks",

Gotten quite far (chapter 5) but essentially I'm getting bored again it's just a massive fetch quest, with long cut scenes let's be honest. Although I am compelled to keep going. I'm not hating it but I'm some what addicted.\n\nSo again I'm sitting here with my steam deck holding forwards and walking through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape and my mind is wondering. I kinda want play a bit of street fighter 6. But I know if I stop playing Death Stranding there's a really big chance I might not come back to it for months. So I keep walking forwards, almost begrudgingly.\n\nThinking back to NMS, I can't remember what I was doing and what I planning to do next. If I boot that up again it might as well be someone else's save. So i probably need to start again. I was about 30 or 40 hours in. That would be the 3rd time I've started NMS again.\n\nThe list goes further back. Death Loop, Disco Elysium (started that around 4 times!), factorio, Dave the diver (I'm almost at the end and then I suddenly dropped it), dredge, elden ring, Kingdom come deliverance, jedi survivor. The last game I finished was Prey, which was excellent.\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue? What do you do? I wonder if it's worth keeping a game diary but honestly it seems like a lot of effort and kinda overkill for a casual endeavor. I don't have ADHD or anything...I don't think.\n\n\n\n",

If anything, it might be simpler, as the emulators will point you towards the correct paths for their save data and you won't have to worry about symlinks (explanation below).)\n* First, [install Syncthing Windows Setup or SyncTrayzor on your PC](https://syncthing.net/downloads/), and SyncThingy on your Steam Deck (via the Discover store in Desktop Mode).\n* With the Syncthing clients open on both machines, pair them by exchanging device IDs between PC and Steam Deck (see: [\"Getting Started\" Syncthing documentation](https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html)).\n   * Rather than going through the process of scanning the QR codes and/or sharing the device IDs somehow, you may be able to just select the respective devices from the nearby devices list (after confirming each device's respective ID first).\n\n# Create Shared Folders on the Steam Deck side of Syncthing\n\n* The [SyncThing guide on the EmuDeck Wiki](https://emudeck.github.io/community-creations/steamos/tools-and-guides/#how-to-set-up-syncthing) lists the appropriate Steam Deck paths and Ignore Patterns for several emulators.\n* In other cases, you can usually find the appropriate paths by launching the emulators themselves and looking for options to open the emulator or save file folder locations.\n   * (NOTE: if you set up EmuDeck on a microSD card instead of the Steam Deck's drive, replace any instances of \"mmcblk0p1\" with the name you set for the microSD card).\n   * The formatting provided in that guide is kind of confusing, but the (text) in the first line of each section WITHIN (but not including) \"path=(text)\" goes in the General > Folder Path field on Syncthing.\n   * The text BELOW (but not including) the \"Ignore Patterns:\" line should be pasted in the matching Ignore Patterns field.\n   * **However, in most cases you probably won't even need to set up the Ignore Patterns like that (see below).**\n* You may also want to sync other folders beyond just save data (BIOS/keys, game updates, metadata, etc.), but I will leave those decisions up to your discretion.\n\n# Ignore Patterns\n\n* The Ignore Patterns field in Syncthing creates a .stignore file in the directory, telling Syncthing what items in there should NOT be included when synced.\n* In most cases, you don't actually need to set up complex Ignore Patterns, as you can just isolate folders such that they should only ever contain relevant files to sync, such as within the save file folders themselves (see examples below).\n* Configuring specific Ignore Patterns is mostly convenient for when you can catch two or more relevant things in one directory (such as saves and states folders) while ignoring the rest of the stuff in there, saving you the hassle of having to make individual Shared Folders for each item.\n* **\"(?d).DS\\_Store\" excludes the hidden folder metadata file that is only applicable to that specific folder, and could cause issues if improperly synced.**\n   * \"A pattern beginning with a (?d) prefix enables removal of these files if they are preventing directory deletion. This prefix should be used by any OS generated files which you are happy to be removed.\"\n   * I'm not sure if it's explicitly necessary, but it seems like good practice and it's even mentioned in the Syncthing documentation examples, so I just include it in all of my Ignore Patterns.\n* Lines marked with \"//\" are comments (non-functional and just for descriptions).\n* Lines marked with \"!/\" marks items as \"do NOT exclude\" (or in other words, \"include\").\n* \"\\*\" excludes anything else in the folder not marked as \"do not exclude\".\n* **Syncthing lets you set a basic default ignore pattern for all new folders, so you don't have to waste your time copy-pasting the same thing over and over like I did.**\n* **(Per device/client) Syncthing > Actions > Settings > Edit Folder Defaults > Ignore Patterns > paste the following:**\n\n&#8203;\n\n    // INCLUDE\n    // items to force-include go below this (prefix with !)\n    \n    // IGNORE\n    // other items to exclude go below this\n    \n    (?d).DS_Store\n\n# Share the folders from the Steam Deck with the PC\n\n* In the Sharing menu of each Shared Folder on Steam Deck, select the PC that you paired to begin sharing/syncing that folder.\n* On your PC, accept the share request on Syncthing, then add the corresponding local folder path.\n* As mentioned above, you can typically find each equivalent folder on PC that contains an emulator's saves by opening the emulator and finding an option to open the saves folder for the emulator or for an individual game.\n* **There are important exceptions to this mentioned below.**\n* In most cases, you can add the same Ignore Patterns for each Shared Folder on PC as you did on Steam Deck.\n* You may find it more convenient to set up all of your Shared Folders on the Steam Deck or Windows first, and then go back to share them all in a row, rather than going back and forth to set up each pair.\n* For some emulator setups, the saves and states folders may be stored in separate locations on one platform, but together on the other. In these cases, they need to be split into separate Shared Folder syncs, but the path on the platform where they are stored together will be used twice. Syncthing will give you a small warning when you do this, but it should be fine as long as you set things up properly.\n* You may also encounter scenarios where the emulator's path names are different on Windows and Steam Deck for whatever reason, such as a \"savedata\" folder on one VS a \"saves\" folder on the other. This can cause the syncing to create a mega-folder that syncs the Steam Deck's folders into the PC directory and vice versa (so now both directories will have both the \"savedata\" and \"saves\" folders, and the saves will not be unified in one folder).\n* To deal with cases like this, you need to adjust your Saved Folder setups. Rather than trying to sync the folders containing the \"savedata\" or \"saves\" folders, set up the Shared Folders to go a layer deeper and sync the contents of those folders with each other instead (contents of \"savedata\" folder synced with the contents of \"saves\" folder).\n\n# Dealing with symlinks\n\n* **!!! IMPORTANT !!! On Windows, EmuDeck does some rearranging using \"symlinks\" as part of its setup for some emulators (ex. RetroArch, Dolphin, azahar). These symlinks can be identified by the folder icon having a box with an arrow in it tacked onto it.**\n* While the EmuDeck wiki tutorial mentions that it \"avoids symlinks\" as they are not compatible with Syncthing, it does not actually explain HOW to avoid dealing with said symlinks. This can be the source of frustrating and confusing errors in Syncthing, and caused me several hours of frustration.\n* **If an emulator points you to a save folder, and that save folder is actually a symlink (go 1 level above to the parent folder and look for the symlink icon), first try checking \"D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\[emulator\\]\\\\saves\" for the actual location of your save files.**\n* As for the full explanation, \"symlinks\", or \"symbolic links\", are special files that are treated as though they are in the location they are placed in, while actually pointing to a different location (like shortcuts, but at the file system level).\n* EmuDeck uses symlinks to clean up certain aspects of emulator configuration, such as storing save files from various emulators in a centralized location while still allowing the emulators to \"see\" them as if they were in their expected default locations. (Note: I think EmuDeck is technically using junctions, not symlinks, but whatever.)\n* However, since these symlinks are just pointers pointing to a different location where the files actually are, they are not compatible with Syncthing. You need to find the locations of the ACTUAL save file folders to input into Syncthing.\n* To do this, launch Command Prompt on Windows and do the following whenever a symlink is encountered.\n   * Input: cd \"\\[path where the symlink is located\\]\"\n   * Input: dir /al\n* This should identify any symlinks in the folder, and where they point to. When setting up the corresponding PC folder paths to match with the Steam Deck paths, use these \"real\" folder paths instead of the \"fake\" symlink paths. By default, most of the symlinks should point to somewhere like \"D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\[emulator\\]\\\\saves\".\n* **Similarly, if you are trying to sync a folder that includes any symlinks, you need to manually exclude all of the symlinks in the Ignore Patterns for that Shared Folder (ex. \"/saves\"), or else Syncthing will throw an error.**\n\n# Finishing setup\n\n* Syncthing does include sync conflict protection, but you may also want to enable File Versioning backups on the Shared Folders you set up (on the Steam Deck side, PC side, or both) if you want extra protection against sync error shenanigans.\n* Some additional/final troubleshooting steps are listed below.\n* Once you are finished doing all of that, you're finally done! You can now switch to Desktop Mode and launch SyncThingy whenever you want to sync data with your PC.\n   * Make sure that Syncthing is also running on your PC.\n   * Alternatively, you can try setting up Syncthing to run automatically in Gaming Mode, per the link above, though I personally didn't bother with this.\n\n# Fix Syncthing not being able to write to .var folder\n\n* (NOTE: To be honest, I'm not sure when exactly this becomes a problem, but multiple guides and comments mentioned it solving issues they were having, so I did it just in case.)\n* In Desktop Mode, install Flatseal via Discover.\n* Launch Flatseal, and scroll on the left sidebar until you find Syncthing/SyncThingy, and select it.\n* On the right, scroll down to \"Filesystem\".\n* Under \"Other files\", click the icon of a folder with a plus sign.\n* Type \"\\~/.var/app:rw\" (no quotes) in the field that appears.\n* Close Flatseal and restart the Steam Deck to apply changes.\n\n# (Obsolete?) Resolve port conflict between Syncthing and Decky\n\n* (NOTE: This may not be an issue in more recent builds of Syncthing, so first verify if you actually need to do anything before wasting your time like I did.)\n   * In Desktop Mode, open Syncthing and access the Web GUI.\n   * Actions > Settings > GUI > GUI Listen Address\n   * If the GUI Listen Address already ends in 8384 (or anything other than 8080 I guess?), then you don't have to do anything.\n   * Else if the GUI Listen Address ends in 8080, proceed as follows.\n* Switch to Gaming Mode > Settings > Developer (Enable Developer Mode in System settings if you haven't already)\n* UNCHECK: CEF Remote Debugging\n* Switch to Desktop Mode and open Syncthing GTK to access the Web GUI.\n* Actions > Settings > GUI > GUI Listen Address\n* Change the port on \"GUI Listen Address\" from 8080 to 8384 (i.e. \"0.0.0.0:8080\" becomes \"0.0.0.0:8384\").\n* Switch back to Gaming Mode and re-enable CEF Remote Debugging.\n* Switch back to Desktop Mode and re-install Decky.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you've made it this far, then hopefully everything should be working, and you can now enjoy convenient cross-save and syncing between your Steam Deck and PC over your local network. Yay!\n\nI know the post was exceedingly long, but I hope it was worth the effort of trying to clarify each step of the process. Please let me know if there are any mistakes or important points that I missed!\n\nI'll close out the post with some examples of the Shared Folders that I set up for myself.\n\n# Emulation - Extra Files (BIOS, Keys, ETC)\n\n* (extraFiles is a folder I made to tuck away things like BIOS, system firmware, etc.)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\extraFiles\n* Steam Deck path: /run/media/deck/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/extraFiles\n\n# Emulation - Game Metadata/Media\n\n* (This is the folder that Emulation Station dumps its scraped game metadata in)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\storage\\\\downloaded\\_media\n* Steam Deck path: /run/media/deck/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/storage/downloaded\\_media/\n\n# azahar\n\n* (saves and states are in different paths on Steam Deck)\n* Windows path (Saves): D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\azahar\\\\saves\n* Windows path (States): D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\azahar\\\\states\n* Steam Deck path (Saves): /run/media/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/storage/azahar/sdmc\n* Steam Deck path (States): /home/deck/.local/share/azahar-emu/states\n\n# Dolphin\n\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\dolphin\n* Steam Deck path: /home/deck/.var/app/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu/data/dolphin-emu\n\n# RetroArch\n\n* (The Steam Deck directory contains more stuff, so you need to set Ignore Patterns to only include the saves and states folders)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\retroarch\n* Steam Deck: /home/deck/.var/app/org.libretro.RetroArch/config/retroarch\n\n# Ignore Patterns\n\n    // INCLUDE\n    !/saves\n    !/states\n    // IGNORE\n    *\n    (?d).DS_Store",

I used it last month on a trip and it took me like 30 minutes to finally boot up because it had updates, etc.\n\nThis time I made sure to go and SHUT DOWN the steam deck so I can preserve the battery. Guess what? I want to use it right now and ... It's not turning on!???!\n\nI put it to charge. I have a white light. Whenever I press the power button I do hear a small soud. So my guess is that the battery went out again.\n\nSo my question is. What the F can I do about this? Why is the battery always running out EVEN when the Steam Deck was turned off. This is absolutley insane.",

I’ve watched a lot of videos about plugins like Decky FrameGen and Lossless Scaling, and I’ve tried to set everything up properly — I even bought Lossless Scaling.\n\nBut I’ve run into a big problem.\nMost of the tutorial videos show how to add the launch command directly in Steam, but I’m trying to play Cyberpunk 2077 from my GOG account, so I’m launching it through Heroic Games Launcher, then addes as a non Steam game, and i play It from there.  In Steam, the launch options already include another command, and if I remove it, the game won’t start.\n\nSo, I went into Heroic and added this as a wrapper command:\n/home/deck/fgmod/fgmod\nThen I gave Heroic access to the path through Flatseal. Everything seems to work fine so far — I can select FSR 4 directly in the game’s graphics settings (though I’m not sure it’s really doing anything).\n\nFor Lossless Scaling, I added another wrapper:\n/home/deck/lsfg\n(If I add %command% at the end, the game won’t launch.)\nI also gave Heroic permission to access the path in Flatseal.\n\nNow, the game launches fine, and when I open the Lossless Scaling plugin from Decky Loader, it correctly detects that Cyberpunk 2077 is running.\nHowever, when I change settings (like switching between 2x, 4x, etc.), it doesn’t seem to have any visible effect — no stutter, no difference at all.\n\nDoes anyone know what I might be doing wrong or how to tell if it’s actually working?\n\nEdit: I have also tried to add the cyberpunk.exe to non Steam games, so i thought i could turn around the problem, but It wont even boot up.",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been wondering about something — is it common for unplayable or poorly performing games on the Steam Deck to eventually run well after patches or updates?\n\nFor example, I’ve always wanted to play Dragon’s Dogma 2, Rise of the Ronin, and now Wuchang: Fallen Feathers on Steam Deck. But I’ve heard the performance for these kinds of games is pretty rough on Deck right now.\n\nFor context, I have both a PS5 and a Steam Deck, but I usually lean toward getting games on Deck since I like being able to play anywhere and mess around with mods for replayability. That said, I’m not sure if it’s worth waiting for patches or optimizations, or if I should just grab them on PS5 and accept that Deck versions might never improve much.\n\nBasically: in your experience, do games like these (big, demanding titles) tend to get better over time on Deck? Or once they’re rough at launch, are they usually stuck that way?",

Anyways, the Steam Deck is an amazing platform to dip my hands into the world of pc gaming myself, while still feeling (to me) like a PS1 meets a Wii U. Digital gaming is a bit of a foreign world to me still, but I'm getting adjusted to it. I am disabled as well, and the form factor is really easy for me to play on. I'll keep this part relatively short, mainly because my left hand is cramping up, but if you all have any questions, feel free to ask, I'll try to answer the best that I can. Thanks",

Which brings me to the point of not being able to afford a gaming PC right now. I say this to say I'm nervous/timid about reaching out to a guild to join seeing as how I only play on steam deck and can't really create my own guild as I have no other friends who play WoW, they're all console gamers or those couple I have that have a steam deck aren't into WoW. Just looking for some advice here. Anyone have a guild that's open to a strictly steam deck player or any interested in creating a steam deck WoW guild haha. But seriously any advice/direction is much appreciated. ",

I have a beast of a PC, why would I need one? If I am going to be out and have extra time, I can just get some reading done instead of gaming.\n\nWell, now I am a mom and I figured I would treat myself to the OLED. My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby. Back to a time without all the responsibilities I carry now, I could have endlessly enjoyed the steam deck. I missed out on three years of being able to potato on the couch after a hard day at work. Before you weep for me, do not worry. I fully plan to own a steam deck for the rest of my life to make up for it.\n\nTL;DR: Buy a steam deck, and live a happy life.",

    "selftext": "So I was playing no Man Sky. I was enjoying it but I was getting a little bored. That's when I got distracted by my backlog so I stayed playing Death Stranding. Gotten quite far (chapter 5) but essentially I'm getting bored again it's just a massive fetch quest, with long cut scenes let's be honest. Although I am compelled to keep going. I'm not hating it but I'm some what addicted.\n\nSo again I'm sitting here with my steam deck holding forwards and walking through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape and my mind is wondering. I kinda want play a bit of street fighter 6. But I know if I stop playing Death Stranding there's a really big chance I might not come back to it for months. So I keep walking forwards, almost begrudgingly.\n\nThinking back to NMS, I can't remember what I was doing and what I planning to do next. If I boot that up again it might as well be someone else's save. So i probably need to start again. I was about 30 or 40 hours in. That would be the 3rd time I've started NMS again.\n\nThe list goes further back. Death Loop, Disco Elysium (started that around 4 times!), factorio, Dave the diver (I'm almost at the end and then I suddenly dropped it), dredge, elden ring, Kingdom come deliverance, jedi survivor. The last game I finished was Prey, which was excellent.\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue? What do you do? I wonder if it's worth keeping a game diary but honestly it seems like a lot of effort and kinda overkill for a casual endeavor. I don't have ADHD or anything...I don't think.\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI hope you are all well and enjoying your decks! \n\nI wasn't too sure if I should do this update, I have been getting much weaker as the weeks and days go by and gaming of any kind has become almost impossible it feels. I struggle to play more than an hour but I do try! I am finding myself losing weight faster than ever before, my strength has all but gone, and I struggle greatly with nausea so much even as I try to write this I am having to take breaks, so just please understand that ALL I want to do is chat and play with all of you, I would love to do nothing more but its becoming harder and harder. \n\nEven then we still GAME ON! I have been bedridden so much that watching movies and tv shows is something I can do much easier, so maybe you could drop your fave tv shows and films as well as games!\n\nand lastly before the review, I wondered if it would be worthwhile creating a discord server, where anyone who's bothered could come by and chat, hang out, etc. If you think it could be a good idea, let me know!\n\nDying Light: The Beast - WOW! When I first remember playing Dying Light 1, I was truly blown away, it felt like what I always wanted Dead Island to be, this ultra realistic zombie game, and it just delivered on every level, it made zombies SCARY again, you can't fight hordes, 3 or 4 is a decent battle, the night was scary and the Stalkers! wow. Then came 2, and whilst it developed on every element from the first game, it somehow, mistreated them. \n\nNight was no longer scary, the traversal didn't feel as fun, and it just felt TOO BIG, a bit BLOATED, and I didn't care like I did in 1. So, when Dying Light - The Beast was announced, I actually wasn't too excited, but once it launched all I heard was good things, now I have only played around 4 hours  but those were some of the most exciting, thrilling and scary hours of gaming in a LONG time. The graphics are sublime, the gore, the combat, traversal, it is all for me..perfect in every single way. If you loved 1, then this will be your perfect new zombie game, if you felt let down by 2, this is the game to revitalise that love of killing zombies. \n\nSilent Hill f - Whilst I have only started, it is only my second foray into the Silent Hill world. Now I LOVE Halloween, and I find dev's filmmakers, anyone really when it comes to Horror, they kinda throw in a few jump scares and say \"It's a scary game\" so I love when a game is fully fleshed out, the in's and out's, the themes, the pure scariness! Well, I have pretty much switched Silent Hill f straight off, like right click and close window, because it's CREEPY. The sound design is incredible, and just makes the entire world far more scary. I am still only just pulling back the cover but I am loving it!\n\nI HOPE to be somewhat better soon where I can at least play some games, or just feel like I can exist for a few hours. I always want to be honest with all of you, and the fact is depression is something I have fought with help from my family, but the last few weeks, I have just felt lower, and lower. Everyday is harder, and I am struggling more than ever. I have support, I have people, but there's an finality setting in, an understanding that my mum can't just be a MUM and fix this, I think maybe it is all catching up to me. \n\nThank you once again for taking your time to read this and being apart of this journey, I apologise for the gap between these posts but I am just shedding weight, I look in the mirror and I don't know who I see, for the first time I looked at myself and truly admitted. \"I am sick, this is it\". It has been tough, but whenever I have felt down either Reddit or Steam will ping and someone will be checking in, someone will be seeing how I am, and that..that really keeps me going. So each and everyone of you mean the world to me. \n\n  \nI hope more than anything to continue my silly updates, we have a new Football manager coming out, Outer worlds 2! Vampire: Masquerade 2! and that just a few amazing experiences that I hold on to, seeing my family everyday, speaking with you all, and looking forward to games, that's a core of my push each day and it works so far :')\n\nOnce again, thank you for taking time to read this, and I hope to hear from you all. \n\nAdd me on Steam anytime! 82871772\n\nAnd if you fancy joining my Discord server, so we have somewhere to chat - https://discord.gg/TjRhH2Ye\n\nM",

But I’ve heard the performance for these kinds of games is pretty rough on Deck right now.\n\nFor context, I have both a PS5 and a Steam Deck, but I usually lean toward getting games on Deck since I like being able to play anywhere and mess around with mods for replayability. That said, I’m not sure if it’s worth waiting for patches or optimizations, or if I should just grab them on PS5 and accept that Deck versions might never improve much.\n\nBasically: in your experience, do games like these (big, demanding titles) tend to get better over time on Deck? Or once they’re rough at launch, are they usually stuck that way?",

EmuDeck configures things to make the locations of things like save data folders more consistent, but it also means extra work to set up Syncthing properly.)\n* (If you set up your emulators without EmuDeck on either platform, most of this guide should still be applicable, though you'll be on your own in terms of figuring out the correct paths. If anything, it might be simpler, as the emulators will point you towards the correct paths for their save data and you won't have to worry about symlinks (explanation below).)\n* First, [install Syncthing Windows Setup or SyncTrayzor on your PC](https://syncthing.net/downloads/), and SyncThingy on your Steam Deck (via the Discover store in Desktop Mode).\n* With the Syncthing clients open on both machines, pair them by exchanging device IDs between PC and Steam Deck (see: [\"Getting Started\" Syncthing documentation](https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html)).\n   * Rather than going through the process of scanning the QR codes and/or sharing the device IDs somehow, you may be able to just select the respective devices from the nearby devices list (after confirming each device's respective ID first).\n\n# Create Shared Folders on the Steam Deck side of Syncthing\n\n* The [SyncThing guide on the EmuDeck Wiki](https://emudeck.github.io/community-creations/steamos/tools-and-guides/#how-to-set-up-syncthing) lists the appropriate Steam Deck paths and Ignore Patterns for several emulators.\n* In other cases, you can usually find the appropriate paths by launching the emulators themselves and looking for options to open the emulator or save file folder locations.\n   * (NOTE: if you set up EmuDeck on a microSD card instead of the Steam Deck's drive, replace any instances of \"mmcblk0p1\" with the name you set for the microSD card).\n   * The formatting provided in that guide is kind of confusing, but the (text) in the first line of each section WITHIN (but not including) \"path=(text)\" goes in the General > Folder Path field on Syncthing.\n   * The text BELOW (but not including) the \"Ignore Patterns:\" line should be pasted in the matching Ignore Patterns field.\n   * **However, in most cases you probably won't even need to set up the Ignore Patterns like that (see below).**\n* You may also want to sync other folders beyond just save data (BIOS/keys, game updates, metadata, etc.), but I will leave those decisions up to your discretion.\n\n# Ignore Patterns\n\n* The Ignore Patterns field in Syncthing creates a .stignore file in the directory, telling Syncthing what items in there should NOT be included when synced.\n* In most cases, you don't actually need to set up complex Ignore Patterns, as you can just isolate folders such that they should only ever contain relevant files to sync, such as within the save file folders themselves (see examples below).\n* Configuring specific Ignore Patterns is mostly convenient for when you can catch two or more relevant things in one directory (such as saves and states folders) while ignoring the rest of the stuff in there, saving you the hassle of having to make individual Shared Folders for each item.\n* **\"(?d).DS\\_Store\" excludes the hidden folder metadata file that is only applicable to that specific folder, and could cause issues if improperly synced.**\n   * \"A pattern beginning with a (?d) prefix enables removal of these files if they are preventing directory deletion. This prefix should be used by any OS generated files which you are happy to be removed.\"\n   * I'm not sure if it's explicitly necessary, but it seems like good practice and it's even mentioned in the Syncthing documentation examples, so I just include it in all of my Ignore Patterns.\n* Lines marked with \"//\" are comments (non-functional and just for descriptions).\n* Lines marked with \"!/\" marks items as \"do NOT exclude\" (or in other words, \"include\").\n* \"\\*\" excludes anything else in the folder not marked as \"do not exclude\".\n* **Syncthing lets you set a basic default ignore pattern for all new folders, so you don't have to waste your time copy-pasting the same thing over and over like I did.**\n* **(Per device/client) Syncthing > Actions > Settings > Edit Folder Defaults > Ignore Patterns > paste the following:**\n\n&#8203;\n\n    // INCLUDE\n    // items to force-include go below this (prefix with !)\n    \n    // IGNORE\n    // other items to exclude go below this\n    \n    (?d).DS_Store\n\n# Share the folders from the Steam Deck with the PC\n\n* In the Sharing menu of each Shared Folder on Steam Deck, select the PC that you paired to begin sharing/syncing that folder.\n* On your PC, accept the share request on Syncthing, then add the corresponding local folder path.\n* As mentioned above, you can typically find each equivalent folder on PC that contains an emulator's saves by opening the emulator and finding an option to open the saves folder for the emulator or for an individual game.\n* **There are important exceptions to this mentioned below.**\n* In most cases, you can add the same Ignore Patterns for each Shared Folder on PC as you did on Steam Deck.\n* You may find it more convenient to set up all of your Shared Folders on the Steam Deck or Windows first, and then go back to share them all in a row, rather than going back and forth to set up each pair.\n* For some emulator setups, the saves and states folders may be stored in separate locations on one platform, but together on the other. In these cases, they need to be split into separate Shared Folder syncs, but the path on the platform where they are stored together will be used twice. Syncthing will give you a small warning when you do this, but it should be fine as long as you set things up properly.\n* You may also encounter scenarios where the emulator's path names are different on Windows and Steam Deck for whatever reason, such as a \"savedata\" folder on one VS a \"saves\" folder on the other. This can cause the syncing to create a mega-folder that syncs the Steam Deck's folders into the PC directory and vice versa (so now both directories will have both the \"savedata\" and \"saves\" folders, and the saves will not be unified in one folder).\n* To deal with cases like this, you need to adjust your Saved Folder setups. Rather than trying to sync the folders containing the \"savedata\" or \"saves\" folders, set up the Shared Folders to go a layer deeper and sync the contents of those folders with each other instead (contents of \"savedata\" folder synced with the contents of \"saves\" folder).\n\n# Dealing with symlinks\n\n* **!!! IMPORTANT !!! On Windows, EmuDeck does some rearranging using \"symlinks\" as part of its setup for some emulators (ex. RetroArch, Dolphin, azahar). These symlinks can be identified by the folder icon having a box with an arrow in it tacked onto it.**\n* While the EmuDeck wiki tutorial mentions that it \"avoids symlinks\" as they are not compatible with Syncthing, it does not actually explain HOW to avoid dealing with said symlinks. This can be the source of frustrating and confusing errors in Syncthing, and caused me several hours of frustration.\n* **If an emulator points you to a save folder, and that save folder is actually a symlink (go 1 level above to the parent folder and look for the symlink icon), first try checking \"D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\[emulator\\]\\\\saves\" for the actual location of your save files.**\n* As for the full explanation, \"symlinks\", or \"symbolic links\", are special files that are treated as though they are in the location they are placed in, while actually pointing to a different location (like shortcuts, but at the file system level).\n* EmuDeck uses symlinks to clean up certain aspects of emulator configuration, such as storing save files from various emulators in a centralized location while still allowing the emulators to \"see\" them as if they were in their expected default locations. (Note: I think EmuDeck is technically using junctions, not symlinks, but whatever.)\n* However, since these symlinks are just pointers pointing to a different location where the files actually are, they are not compatible with Syncthing. You need to find the locations of the ACTUAL save file folders to input into Syncthing.\n* To do this, launch Command Prompt on Windows and do the following whenever a symlink is encountered.\n   * Input: cd \"\\[path where the symlink is located\\]\"\n   * Input: dir /al\n* This should identify any symlinks in the folder, and where they point to. When setting up the corresponding PC folder paths to match with the Steam Deck paths, use these \"real\" folder paths instead of the \"fake\" symlink paths. By default, most of the symlinks should point to somewhere like \"D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\[emulator\\]\\\\saves\".\n* **Similarly, if you are trying to sync a folder that includes any symlinks, you need to manually exclude all of the symlinks in the Ignore Patterns for that Shared Folder (ex. \"/saves\"), or else Syncthing will throw an error.**\n\n# Finishing setup\n\n* Syncthing does include sync conflict protection, but you may also want to enable File Versioning backups on the Shared Folders you set up (on the Steam Deck side, PC side, or both) if you want extra protection against sync error shenanigans.\n* Some additional/final troubleshooting steps are listed below.\n* Once you are finished doing all of that, you're finally done! You can now switch to Desktop Mode and launch SyncThingy whenever you want to sync data with your PC.\n   * Make sure that Syncthing is also running on your PC.\n   * Alternatively, you can try setting up Syncthing to run automatically in Gaming Mode, per the link above, though I personally didn't bother with this.\n\n# Fix Syncthing not being able to write to .var folder\n\n* (NOTE: To be honest, I'm not sure when exactly this becomes a problem, but multiple guides and comments mentioned it solving issues they were having, so I did it just in case.)\n* In Desktop Mode, install Flatseal via Discover.\n* Launch Flatseal, and scroll on the left sidebar until you find Syncthing/SyncThingy, and select it.\n* On the right, scroll down to \"Filesystem\".\n* Under \"Other files\", click the icon of a folder with a plus sign.\n* Type \"\\~/.var/app:rw\" (no quotes) in the field that appears.\n* Close Flatseal and restart the Steam Deck to apply changes.\n\n# (Obsolete?) Resolve port conflict between Syncthing and Decky\n\n* (NOTE: This may not be an issue in more recent builds of Syncthing, so first verify if you actually need to do anything before wasting your time like I did.)\n   * In Desktop Mode, open Syncthing and access the Web GUI.\n   * Actions > Settings > GUI > GUI Listen Address\n   * If the GUI Listen Address already ends in 8384 (or anything other than 8080 I guess?), then you don't have to do anything.\n   * Else if the GUI Listen Address ends in 8080, proceed as follows.\n* Switch to Gaming Mode > Settings > Developer (Enable Developer Mode in System settings if you haven't already)\n* UNCHECK: CEF Remote Debugging\n* Switch to Desktop Mode and open Syncthing GTK to access the Web GUI.\n* Actions > Settings > GUI > GUI Listen Address\n* Change the port on \"GUI Listen Address\" from 8080 to 8384 (i.e. \"0.0.0.0:8080\" becomes \"0.0.0.0:8384\").\n* Switch back to Gaming Mode and re-enable CEF Remote Debugging.\n* Switch back to Desktop Mode and re-install Decky.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you've made it this far, then hopefully everything should be working, and you can now enjoy convenient cross-save and syncing between your Steam Deck and PC over your local network. Yay!\n\nI know the post was exceedingly long, but I hope it was worth the effort of trying to clarify each step of the process. Please let me know if there are any mistakes or important points that I missed!\n\nI'll close out the post with some examples of the Shared Folders that I set up for myself.\n\n# Emulation - Extra Files (BIOS, Keys, ETC)\n\n* (extraFiles is a folder I made to tuck away things like BIOS, system firmware, etc.)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\extraFiles\n* Steam Deck path: /run/media/deck/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/extraFiles\n\n# Emulation - Game Metadata/Media\n\n* (This is the folder that Emulation Station dumps its scraped game metadata in)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\storage\\\\downloaded\\_media\n* Steam Deck path: /run/media/deck/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/storage/downloaded\\_media/\n\n# azahar\n\n* (saves and states are in different paths on Steam Deck)\n* Windows path (Saves): D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\azahar\\\\saves\n* Windows path (States): D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\azahar\\\\states\n* Steam Deck path (Saves): /run/media/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/storage/azahar/sdmc\n* Steam Deck path (States): /home/deck/.local/share/azahar-emu/states\n\n# Dolphin\n\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\dolphin\n* Steam Deck path: /home/deck/.var/app/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu/data/dolphin-emu\n\n# RetroArch\n\n* (The Steam Deck directory contains more stuff, so you need to set Ignore Patterns to only include the saves and states folders)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\retroarch\n* Steam Deck: /home/deck/.var/app/org.libretro.RetroArch/config/retroarch\n\n# Ignore Patterns\n\n    // INCLUDE\n    !/saves\n    !/states\n    // IGNORE\n    *\n    (?d).DS_Store",

I have a beast of a PC, why would I need one? If I am going to be out and have extra time, I can just get some reading done instead of gaming.\n\nWell, now I am a mom and I figured I would treat myself to the OLED. My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby. Back to a time without all the responsibilities I carry now, I could have endlessly enjoyed the steam deck. I missed out on three years of being able to potato on the couch after a hard day at work. Before you weep for me, do not worry. I fully plan to own a steam deck for the rest of my life to make up for it.\n\nTL;DR: Buy a steam deck, and live a happy life.",

Gotten quite far (chapter 5) but essentially I'm getting bored again it's just a massive fetch quest, with long cut scenes let's be honest. Although I am compelled to keep going. I'm not hating it but I'm some what addicted.\n\nSo again I'm sitting here with my steam deck holding forwards and walking through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape and my mind is wondering. I kinda want play a bit of street fighter 6. But I know if I stop playing Death Stranding there's a really big chance I might not come back to it for months. So I keep walking forwards, almost begrudgingly.\n\nThinking back to NMS, I can't remember what I was doing and what I planning to do next. If I boot that up again it might as well be someone else's save. So i probably need to start again. I was about 30 or 40 hours in. That would be the 3rd time I've started NMS again.\n\nThe list goes further back. Death Loop, Disco Elysium (started that around 4 times!), factorio, Dave the diver (I'm almost at the end and then I suddenly dropped it), dredge, elden ring, Kingdom come deliverance, jedi survivor. The last game I finished was Prey, which was excellent.\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue? What do you do? I wonder if it's worth keeping a game diary but honestly it seems like a lot of effort and kinda overkill for a casual endeavor. I don't have ADHD or anything...I don't think.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "What I'm trying to play as I die: A somewhat update!",
    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI hope you are all well and enjoying your decks! \n\nI wasn't too sure if I should do this update, I have been getting much weaker as the weeks and days go by and gaming of any kind has become almost impossible it feels. I struggle to play more than an hour but I do try! I am finding myself losing weight faster than ever before, my strength has all but gone, and I struggle greatly with nausea so much even as I try to write this I am having to take breaks, so just please understand that ALL I want to do is chat and play with all of you, I would love to do nothing more but its becoming harder and harder. \n\nEven then we still GAME ON! I have been bedridden so much that watching movies and tv shows is something I can do much easier, so maybe you could drop your fave tv shows and films as well as games!\n\nand lastly before the review, I wondered if it would be worthwhile creating a discord server, where anyone who's bothered could come by and chat, hang out, etc. If you think it could be a good idea, let me know!\n\nDying Light: The Beast - WOW! When I first remember playing Dying Light 1, I was truly blown away, it felt like what I always wanted Dead Island to be, this ultra realistic zombie game, and it just delivered on every level, it made zombies SCARY again, you can't fight hordes, 3 or 4 is a decent battle, the night was scary and the Stalkers! wow. Then came 2, and whilst it developed on every element from the first game, it somehow, mistreated them. \n\nNight was no longer scary, the traversal didn't feel as fun, and it just felt TOO BIG, a bit BLOATED, and I didn't care like I did in 1. So, when Dying Light - The Beast was announced, I actually wasn't too excited, but once it launched all I heard was good things, now I have only played around 4 hours  but those were some of the most exciting, thrilling and scary hours of gaming in a LONG time. The graphics are sublime, the gore, the combat, traversal, it is all for me..perfect in every single way. If you loved 1, then this will be your perfect new zombie game, if you felt let down by 2, this is the game to revitalise that love of killing zombies. \n\nSilent Hill f - Whilst I have only started, it is only my second foray into the Silent Hill world. Now I LOVE Halloween, and I find dev's filmmakers, anyone really when it comes to Horror, they kinda throw in a few jump scares and say \"It's a scary game\" so I love when a game is fully fleshed out, the in's and out's, the themes, the pure scariness! Well, I have pretty much switched Silent Hill f straight off, like right click and close window, because it's CREEPY. The sound design is incredible, and just makes the entire world far more scary. I am still only just pulling back the cover but I am loving it!\n\nI HOPE to be somewhat better soon where I can at least play some games, or just feel like I can exist for a few hours. I always want to be honest with all of you, and the fact is depression is something I have fought with help from my family, but the last few weeks, I have just felt lower, and lower. Everyday is harder, and I am struggling more than ever. I have support, I have people, but there's an finality setting in, an understanding that my mum can't just be a MUM and fix this, I think maybe it is all catching up to me. \n\nThank you once again for taking your time to read this and being apart of this journey, I apologise for the gap between these posts but I am just shedding weight, I look in the mirror and I don't know who I see, for the first time I looked at myself and truly admitted. \"I am sick, this is it\". It has been tough, but whenever I have felt down either Reddit or Steam will ping and someone will be checking in, someone will be seeing how I am, and that..that really keeps me going. So each and everyone of you mean the world to me. \n\n  \nI hope more than anything to continue my silly updates, we have a new Football manager coming out, Outer worlds 2! Vampire: Masquerade 2! and that just a few amazing experiences that I hold on to, seeing my family everyday, speaking with you all, and looking forward to games, that's a core of my push each day and it works so far :')\n\nOnce again, thank you for taking time to read this, and I hope to hear from you all. \n\nAdd me on Steam anytime! 82871772\n\nAnd if you fancy joining my Discord server, so we have somewhere to chat - https://discord.gg/TjRhH2Ye\n\nM",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been wondering about something — is it common for unplayable or poorly performing games on the Steam Deck to eventually run well after patches or updates?\n\nFor example, I’ve always wanted to play Dragon’s Dogma 2, Rise of the Ronin, and now Wuchang: Fallen Feathers on Steam Deck. But I’ve heard the performance for these kinds of games is pretty rough on Deck right now.\n\nFor context, I have both a PS5 and a Steam Deck, but I usually lean toward getting games on Deck since I like being able to play anywhere and mess around with mods for replayability. That said, I’m not sure if it’s worth waiting for patches or optimizations, or if I should just grab them on PS5 and accept that Deck versions might never improve much.\n\nBasically: in your experience, do games like these (big, demanding titles) tend to get better over time on Deck? Or once they’re rough at launch, are they usually stuck that way?",

I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather).

I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

What really caught my attention though is Gambit Robotics AND mostly because it seems to focus on real-time guidance instead of just automation which allows me to just turn off my brain when i get home.\n\nI get that some people see this as cheating or lazy but honestly? For busy professionals, that’s the point. We don’t want to replace cooking we just want to make it less stressful. If tech can make homemade food easier to pull off after a 10-hour workday + I get to go to the gym, imagine the daily impact of that in the long run and tbhh that’s a win in my book",

Right now, there’s an old intercom system that lets me talk to visitors and open the gate remotely from inside the house. The gate lock uses an electric strike (if that’s the right term).\n\nI’d like to replace the current system with a smart doorbell that has a camera and allows remote access (via app). Power is already available at the gate, and the electric strike works fine.\n\nMy idea was to install a mobile LTE/5G router at the gate to provide Wi-Fi there and then use a device like Ring or a similar system for the video doorbell.\n\nMy questions:\n\t•\tWould you approach this differently?\n\t•\tAny recommendations for specific brands or systems?\n\t•\tCan a system like Ring, Nuki (or similar) actually control an electric strike, or would I need a different setup for that part?\n\t•\tIdeally, I’d like one provider for both the gate doorbell and a smart doorbell/lock at the main house door, to keep everything within one ecosystem, or do you think that having different systems does not make a huge difference?\n\nThanks a lot for any tips or setups that worked well for you!",

    "selftext": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI'd like to share my open-source project **Proxmox-GitOps**, a Container Automation platform for provisioning and orchestrating Linux containers (LXC) on Proxmox VE - encapsulated as comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC).\n\n**Proxmox-GitOps (@Github)**: [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps)\n \n* **Demo** (~1m): [https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY](https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY)\n\n* **Demo** (low, no ads): [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif)\n\n\n**TL;DR**: By encapsulating infrastructure within an extensible monorepository - recursively resolved from Git submodules at runtime - Proxmox-GitOps provides a comprehensive Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) abstraction for an entire, automated, container-based infrastructure.\n\nOriginally, it was a personal attempt to bring industrial automation and cloud patterns to my Proxmox home server. It's designed as a platform architecture for a self-contained, bootstrappable system - a generic IaC abstraction (customize, extend, .. open standards, base package only, .. - you name it 😉) that automates the entire infrastructure. It was initially driven by the question of what a Proxmox-based GitOps automation could look like and how it could be organized.\n\n**Core Concepts**\n\n* **Recursive Self-management**: Control plane seeds itself by pushing its monorepository onto a locally bootstrapped instance, triggering a pipeline that recursively provisions the control plane onto PVE.\n\n* **Monorepository**: Centralizes infrastructure as comprehensive IaC artifact (for mirroring, like the project itself on Github) using submodules for modular composition.\n\n* **Git as State**: Git repository represents the desired infrastructure state.\n\n* **Loose coupling**: Containers are decoupled from the control plane, enabling runtime replacement and independent operation.\n\nOver the past few months, the project stabilized, and I’ve addressed many questions you had in Wiki, summarized to documentation, which should now covers essential technical, conceptual, and practical aspects. I’ve also added a short demo that breaks down the theory by demonstrating the automation of an IaC stack (Home Assistant, Mosquitto bridge, Zigbee2MQTT broker, snapshot restore, reverse proxy, dynamically configured via PVE API), with automated container system updates and service checks.\n\n**What am I looking for?** It's a noncommercial, passion-driven project. I'm looking to collaborate with other engineers who share the excitement of building a self-contained, bootstrappable platform architecture that addresses the question: What should our home automation look like?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts!",

    "title": "Smart light for woodstove temperature indication",
    "selftext": "Last year, I installed a k-type thermocouple in my wood stove flue pipe. Coupled with an esp8266, it's let me keep track of stove temperatures and helped optimize burns (when to cut back primary air, when to reload, etc). As a result, last week when I cleaned the chimney for the season, I had virtually no creosote build up.  I had set up some simple notifications to our phones like over fire when temp > 800F and reload when temp < 250F, but it was a bit of a pain to pull my phone out throughout the night to keep tabs on the stove. Tonight, I mapped the temperature reading to a hue value on the hue/sat color wheel and setup an automation to gradually adjust a virtually unused wyze color bulb in the corner for a visual stove temperature indication. After burn #1 with it in place, I'm pretty satisfied! Blue = cold, green = target, red = hot. With the hue mapping, color gradually adjusts every 30s in small increments throughout the burn.\n\n  \nFull write up here: [https://houndhillhomestead.com/smart-light-wood-stove-temperature-indication/](https://houndhillhomestead.com/smart-light-wood-stove-temperature-indication/)\n\nAnd original stove monitoring write up here: [https://houndhillhomestead.com/woodstove-temperature-monitoring/](https://houndhillhomestead.com/woodstove-temperature-monitoring/)",

    "title": "My impression of SmartWings shades",
    "selftext": "The other day I got into a convo wth another Redditor who asked in this sub some specifics about SmartWings shades. I bought some earlier this year for a couple of the bedrooms and then installed a set in my home office yesterday, so I thought I would write a longer review.\n\nMy smarthome setup consists of Google Home, a Hubitat hub, and primarily Z-Wave Plus products. All of my SmartWings shades have Z-Wave Plus motors. In the bedrooms I installed 90% blackout Zebra shades. Yesterday I installed a 70% blackout woven wood roller shade in my home office.\n\nWhen ordering there's a good bit of information to fill in and a number of choices to make, so be sure to allow yourself a sufficient block of time. The fabric colors are clearly outlined but it's not always easy to make a proper comparison from a PC or phone. You can order a book of fabric samples, which I did prior to placing my second order.\n\nThe measuring instructions are clear and there's no need to overcompensate for anything. I added the minimum suggested amount to the window length and the side blackout works great. For the Zebra shade height I overcompensated and ended up having to mount the Zebra shades higher than originally planned because the bedroom window sills jut out a bit. The Zebra shades have to be mounted at an exact height so that the fabric lines up correctly when the shade is fully closed.  If there's no obstruction like a window sill then that won't really matter, but in my case it did and I measured too long, That was user error on my part. Just measure the window height and add the suggested amount for the mounts. There's no need to add any length past that.\n\nShipping takes a few weeks since they come from China. Once the order is marked as in transit, the shipment arrives within a few days.\n\nInstallation is easy, unless you measure too long like I did. :D There are a handful of brackets to install for the Zebra shades, and if you order an outside mount like I did, there are extenders to install as well. The woven wood shade that I ordered recently is even easier to install, with brackets only and a top-down connection. I recommend having an installation buddy for any blind wider than a single window. The blinds aren't heavy but if lengthy they can be unwieldy to hold solo.\n\nConnecting to the home network is easy, requiring only the app for your hub and the appropriate PIN or ID for the device.\n\nI didn't get the solar chargers on any of the blinds, figuring I would just charge them as needed. Thus far I've only had to charge the bedroom blinds twice in 8 months. \n\nI've been highly satisfied with the blinds in the bedrooms, and the newly installed woven wood shade in my office is working great as well.  These blinds are on the pricier side but the quality is excellent and the setup is easy.\n\nOne other note: at first I was using my ADT alarm system as the hub and not Hubitat.  Google Home wouldn't recognize the blinds even though they had been added to ADT successfully. Of ADT, Google, and SmartWings, only the SmartWings customer service rep seemed to have any clue a to what was going on. ADT's response was \"sorry we don't sell that product so I can't help you.\" Google customer support told me to disconnect and reconnect ADT even though I plainly told them that I'd already tried that, and when it still didn't work they said \"oh that's too bad thanks bye.\" Ha. The SmartWings chat rep listened to what was going on and correctly suspected that the ADT controller wasn't properly communicating the presence of the blinds with Google Home. They recommended that I switch my hub to either Google Hub or one of their other supported hubs. I went with Hubitat and now it all works great.\n\nBottom line, SmartWings are solid and easy to set up smart blinds.",

I have Pex A piping, which is already a potential problem due to the Titan exerting pressure on the softer plastic.

    "title": "How to Design a System for my Home?",
    "selftext": "Hello, I’m under contract for a new home and will gain access in a couple of weeks. I’m feeling a tiny bit overwhelmed. I have what I would consider above average tech skills. I’m a software engineer by trade writing web apps, and I first learned to code on Arduino over a decade ago so I have decent programming and cursory electronics skills (I could install a WiFi relay or something of similar complexity without help). I used to have my whole place set up with WiFi bulbs and a WiFi thermostat connected to google home and do enjoy the benefits of smart home features (though WiFi bulbs were kind of a pain and I’m excited to control things at the switch instead). \n\nI’m interested in designing a home automation system throughout the home that far exceeds what I’ve been able to do previously as a renter. Part of that means I want to set up a network rack and run cat 6 cabling throughout the house. I want to make good choices early so I don’t have to upgrade later, but I’m having trouble deciding what that means for my project. \n\nThe house is a 4 story townhome in the the middle of a city so I do want some cameras and security features, but I don’t have a yard, just a 1 car garage. I think maybe having PoE run everywhere is the right way to do it? I have a little bit of an attention deficit and replacing batteries in a bunch of devices is a hassle. \n\nI also need a little advice on how to figure out what’s already been set up, the house has a Bluetooth speaker system throughout, and there were some digital intercom screens set up in a few rooms but they appeared to be turned off we did the tour/inspection. \n\nThere’s also the matter of hardware and software choices. I’ve heard great things about the unifi ubiquiti platform and would like to try a nice network setup as a backbone for the project, and I’m excited to build on an open sourced platform like home assistant. I tried having a conversation with an LLM about hardware and some things like a dedicated firewall seem like overkill? It’s tough to right size a system without having seen common setups before.\n\nAll of these variables have led me into a bit of an analysis paralysis, I wanted to start home lab-ing a bit in preparation but can’t decide what parts of the project I can get a head start on or if I should just wait to get the keys. I feel if I wait too long to run the cat6 I might have to do it after our stuff is moved in making things a little harder (I have a month and a half or so of overlap to move), but I figure getting someone out here to do the work twice will cost more so I should figure out how many ports I’m going to have them drop quickly. \n\nMostly just looking for general advice, tips, or other experiences to learn from on how to properly design and diagram everything and come up with a semblance of a plan going into the new home. Help!",

    "selftext": "So I recently discovered the Anki Vector Robot on TikTok, and I’ve been fascinated ever since. He’s this tiny AI companion that can tell the weather, take photos, roll dice, and even deal blackjack. When connected to Alexa, he can also handle smart home tasks like controlling lights or adding things to your shopping list. It’s wild how much personality they packed into such a small device. What I love most is how interactive he seems. You can say, “Hey Vector, I have a question,” and he’ll actually think before answering, kind of like a miniature voice assistant with a face. He also reacts when you touch or move him, thanks to built-in sensors that make him feel almost alive. Pet him, and he relaxes; shake him, and he gets grumpy (which, fair enough). The only concern I’ve found is that the original company, Anki, went out of business, so some features now rely on third-party servers like Wire Pod to stay functional. Still, the charm is undeniable. If you’re shopping around, I noticed the Anki Vector Robot is available on Alibaba at much more reasonable prices than Amazon’s listings. Anyone here using Vector lately, does he still live up to the hype? Edit: Reposted ",

It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "I bought 2 smart plug brands so far, both matter compatible so that I could use them with Apple Home. I have an Apple TV serving as a hub pointing to my home WiFi. \n\nBrand 1 (Sailsco) I could connect fine but after a few days they kept disconnecting showing me the “No response” message. I got sick of this so I bought Brand 2. \n\nBrand 2 (Linkind) I can connect fine, but the moment I disconnect it from power, even for a few seconds, it never connects back again to Apple Home. \n\nBoth are responsible for the “No response” message across the plugs in my screenshot. \n\nThe “Hallway” light always stays online but it’s a different light brand. So I know it’s not an issue with my hub. \n\nWhat’s causing these issues? These smart plug brands have hundreds of reviews on Amazon. I can’t be the only one running into a bug like this? This is literally basic functionality. How come I’m facing them but none of the other thousands of people on Amazon buying them aren’t?",

Mainly they're only lockable (reliably) from the inside / manually. The motor sounds like it is locking when you push the lock button, but it doesn't actually lock (even with fresh batteries). The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather). The fingerprint access is the reason I bought them at the time, and it rarely works (even when I reprogram the lock, it forgets my prints in a week or two). I will not buy another Utec and when I searched the group that's what people recommended.  \nWe are looking for a deadbolt replacement lock (no handle / knob needed) that has fingerprint and bluetooth (no wifi). Any secure ones out there that are resistant to drilling? If we had to go with no bluetooth, that would be fine too. Thanks in advance.",

    "selftext": "[](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZigBee/?f=flair_name%3A%22help%20request%22)Hi everyone! This is a follow up post to one I made a few days ago. I'm trying to come up with a way to use a bluetooth (not wifi) thermometer/hygrometer and connect it to a pc (windows). I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to design some exterior lighting using COB LED strips. I intend to make these strips WiFi connected but currently they are not. They are pretty basic with only dimming, on, and off functions, 12V. Ideally, I would have both physical controls and LAN-Based smart controls maybe through something like home assistant. I'm sure you can tell I'm pretty new to this type of project. I do have experience working g on electronics, so that isn't an issue. \n\nRight now, I'm mostly trying to figure out how to add some form of smart controller into the line. I have several 12V lines running to the lights. Any advice or help you guys can give is appreciated. ",

Unfortunately, the app hasn’t worked since August, when I deleted and tried to reinstall it after changing my home WiFi.  The phone now won’t pair with the socket. (Curiously, the socket appears on my Linksys app as a connected device to the WiFi.) I’ve spoken twice to the socket manufacturers, Luceco. They say they’re aware some iPhone users can no longer pair their phones to the sockets. Android phones seem unaffected. Luceco outsourced the creation of the app to a third party, and they are awaiting an update from them. It’s all very amateurish. I’ve disabled the 5GHz WiFi band during pairing, which didn’t work.\nShort of getting an android phone, has anyone any suggestions?",

I saw that the company shut down or something like that. I have zero interest in any complicated set ups to make it work again so I'm looking to replace them. What are some good budget replacements? Something bright but it doesn't have to be crazy. RGB isn't necessary but I did enjoy switching to red lights whenever I felt overstimulated. ㅤNeed 4. \n\nI loved the simple operation of the Sengled bulbs being controlled from my phone with Google Assistant or through the app. \n\n2. Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up? Something without a subscription.\n\n  \nAdded request - We're using a really old camera system. I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription. I don't live in the US and spending USD adds up really quick with forex limits.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nPS. If there's a better community for me to ask these things, feel free to scold me and send me on my way.",

    "selftext": "I have a Nest thermostat in my apartment building- and have the “Auto-Schedule” feature on.\n\nPer the app description, “Auto-Schedule learns your behavior as you adjust your thermostat and automatically creates a schedule to match your heating and cooling preferences.”\n\nHowever, my Nest does not seem to be adjusting properly. I like to sleep with the temperature around 74-75, but during the day I keep it a few degrees warmer, closer to 77. Every single night I have to change the thermostat manually to be set around 75, and then I have to do the same thing every morning. It has been months and I am starting to get frustrated. Last night the temperature adjusted from 75 to 77 while I was sleeping and I woke up in the middle of the night. That would be the opposite scheduling of what I want, and I’m starting to get incredibly frustrated.\n\nDoes anyone else have similar issues, and how could I correct it?",

Run the Device utility, it won't find the clock. Remove the Device Utility from you phone and go back into Google Home and open the \"Speaker\" that is your clock. Now under settings / digital wellbeing it will have night mode turn it on set up for 12am to 11:59pm and adjust the led brightness to the level you want and it will stay that way. I also checked do not disturb and volume to min. I just use mine for a display clock which I find perfect, size of time and size of temp to see from across room. Have not found another clock display like this one. Echo's ALL suck",

Like, a smart switch at each far end, combined with a smart relay hidden behind the regular lighting panels of the other circuits. And when I hit either of the smart switches, the relays are all automated to turn on or off. \n\nIs that right?! What’s the best way to run such an automation?

This light works great as either a bathroom light or a DIY xray tool because Holy guacamole is it bright!!! Now, I don't necessarily have an issue with the brightness but my wife isn't a huge fan of it in the mornings. I'd like to connect something in line with either the pull cord switch or the light fixture itself which would be able to connect to my home WiFi or my Sonoff Zigbee bridge Pro hub so I can set scenes or schedules so that it's dimmer in the mornings/evenings but brighter during the day. Would a Shelly device be something I should be looking into? Or something better/different?\n\nI'm in the UK if that helps.\n\nThanks 😊 ",

    "selftext": "Hi -\n\nI have a (new to me) 100+ year old house with some old wiring in areas. Several circuits don't have a neutral wire. Other circuits run through tight electrical boxes, and won't accomodate larger standard ZWave or Zigbee switches like Jasco/GE/Enbrighten. Lutron Caseta doesn't fit the aesthetic of this old Victorian. This is new territory for me, so I am looking at the Sonoff units like the one below.  \n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYNRF8GV?ref=ppx\\_yo2ov\\_dt\\_b\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYNRF8GV?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)\n\nI am using Home Assistant now - I been using SmartThings from Samsung/Aeotek for 10 years.  I ordered the Sonoff Pro Hub just in case I need it, but I'd rather integrate directly with HA. My Home Assistant Green has both Zigbee and Zwave plug ins already installed and working.\n\nI'd love to hear from some folks with similar setups and their experiences with them. This is a larger house, and there are probably 14 light circuits that I would like to control.\n\nTIA",

It took some time, but I’ve decided it’s time to overhaul everything; desk, chairs, blackboard, and, most importantly, my bed. After long nights of work and countless tabs open, comfort has become non-negotiable.\n\nAnd that’s how I stumbled onto the concept of the Smart Bed. Adjustable firmness, sleep tracking, temperature control; the features sound straight out of a sci-fi film. Getting one now feels more possible than ever with all the online options available. My friend even helped me look through various designs on Alibaba and we were able to narrow it down to 2 peculiar interests. \n\nBut here’s the catch: while money isn’t the issue, I can’t shake off this nagging thought. Shouldn’t my late-night hours be a sanctuary away from screens and tech? Am I inviting more distractions into a space that should balance work and rest?\n\nPart of me is excited about the upgrade, but another part feels skeptical. Will a smart bed genuinely improve my life, or is it just a shiny gadget I don’t really need?\n\nSo please, I’d love your take. Do you own a smart bed? Is it worth the hype, or should I stick to a traditional high-quality mattress? What are the hidden pros and cons no one talks about?",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

Ich suche also keine Lauflicht-Animation, sondern einfach einen gleichmäßigen Fade-In / Fade-Out für alle Spots zusammen.\n\nGesteuert wird bei mir über [Hue-Bridge / Home Assistant / Zigbee2MQTT – bitte hier anpassen].\nDie Spots laufen mit [230 V / 12 V / 24 V – bitte anpassen].\n\nKennt jemand einen Zigbee-Dimmer oder Controller, der solche Übergänge unterstützt?\nAm liebsten ein Modell, das zuverlässig mit Zigbee3.0-Netzen funktioniert.\n\nFreue mich über jeden Tipp oder Erfahrungswert!",

    "selftext": "Is or has anyone else thought about doing this? Has anyone done it successfully? \n\nI'd like parts of my home to have lights turn on ONLY when there is a person detected. Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

Something bright but it doesn't have to be crazy. RGB isn't necessary but I did enjoy switching to red lights whenever I felt overstimulated. ㅤNeed 4. \n\nI loved the simple operation of the Sengled bulbs being controlled from my phone with Google Assistant or through the app. \n\n2. Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up? Something without a subscription.\n\n  \nAdded request - We're using a really old camera system. I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription. I don't live in the US and spending USD adds up really quick with forex limits.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nPS.

    "selftext": "I have a Nest thermostat in my apartment building- and have the “Auto-Schedule” feature on.\n\nPer the app description, “Auto-Schedule learns your behavior as you adjust your thermostat and automatically creates a schedule to match your heating and cooling preferences.”\n\nHowever, my Nest does not seem to be adjusting properly. I like to sleep with the temperature around 74-75, but during the day I keep it a few degrees warmer, closer to 77. Every single night I have to change the thermostat manually to be set around 75, and then I have to do the same thing every morning. It has been months and I am starting to get frustrated. Last night the temperature adjusted from 75 to 77 while I was sleeping and I woke up in the middle of the night. That would be the opposite scheduling of what I want, and I’m starting to get incredibly frustrated.\n\nDoes anyone else have similar issues, and how could I correct it?",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to design some exterior lighting using COB LED strips. I intend to make these strips WiFi connected but currently they are not. They are pretty basic with only dimming, on, and off functions, 12V. Ideally, I would have both physical controls and LAN-Based smart controls maybe through something like home assistant. I'm sure you can tell I'm pretty new to this type of project. I do have experience working g on electronics, so that isn't an issue. \n\nRight now, I'm mostly trying to figure out how to add some form of smart controller into the line. I have several 12V lines running to the lights. Any advice or help you guys can give is appreciated. ",

Unfortunately, the app hasn’t worked since August, when I deleted and tried to reinstall it after changing my home WiFi.  The phone now won’t pair with the socket. (Curiously, the socket appears on my Linksys app as a connected device to the WiFi.) I’ve spoken twice to the socket manufacturers, Luceco. They say they’re aware some iPhone users can no longer pair their phones to the sockets. Android phones seem unaffected. Luceco outsourced the creation of the app to a third party, and they are awaiting an update from them. It’s all very amateurish. I’ve disabled the 5GHz WiFi band during pairing, which didn’t work.\nShort of getting an android phone, has anyone any suggestions?",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

    "selftext": "Hello there. I have had success using the Lutron Caseta switches with the hub plugged into my router. I have been using water sensors with Samsung Smart Things but, even with the zigbee protocol the devices go offline frequently and don’t create the mesh I was looking to create. \n\nSo I found the YoLink starter kit on Amazon. Has anyone had any experiences with these sensors and hub ? They are using LoRa to provide connectivity. And use AAA batteries not the lithium ones the Samsung sensors require. \n\nI also am using Google home and have downloaded the app. And it is integrated. I just need to buy the devices. Any reviews from anyone using these in their home ? \n\nLink provided in case you’re are curious. Amazon has this kit for $10.00 less than the manufacturer \n\nThis YoLink starter kit includes a hub and 4 water leak sensors that provide SMS, email, and push notifications to help prevent water damage. \n\nhttps://a.co/d/ehedlNH\n\n",

The other lamp in the room has no such issues and I can’t figure out how to fix it. It will turn off fully if I manually switch it off but then why have a smart lamp?\n\n(First photo taken in night mode doesn’t really do justice of how dim it is, it’s only really noticeable at night)\n\nOnly thing I can think of that’s changed is that the AigoSmart app was recently redownloaded but I can’t see an obvious setting that’s causing this. Anyone ever experience something similar?",

I've had to replace the dining room (3 way without ground) twice already, and it is not working again. I'm tired of spending @ $75.00 per switch every few months.

(Updated BIOS as well)\n\nOtherwise at the moment I have no issues asides from the occasional screen tearing in applications using hardware acceleration. (I have been told this is a windows issue)\n\nThe problem:\n\nI bought battlefield 6 on launch day, and for the first day or so I had no problems. Then a day or two later, I can't exactly remember when, my audio started clicking really badly.\n\nLoud pops, dropouts, etc.\n\nThis was happening with my Astro A50 wireless headset, I believe the gen 2 variation.\n\nAfter some digging I couldn't really find a fix so I opted to buy some HyperX Cloud 3's while I wait for a fix to come out. Plugged them into my usb port, and the same thing happened. Tried the audio jack and it was fixed. \n\nFlash forward a week later, and I got a new webcam today, the logitech Brio 101. Also plugged in through USB, and when using it while playing battlefield 6 it has these white line flickers and the image very often becomes unrecognizable or very distorted\n\nAs soon as I close battlefield, the issue stops entirely. This has become increasingly frustrating and I genuinely do not understand why this is happening.\n\nSorry if the formatting is off I don't really use reddit all that much.\n\nIf anyone else is having a similar issue, I would really appreciate some insight on how to fix this.

    "selftext": "I’ve got an old home PC that I’m still pretty happy with. But recently some really strange things happening. I’m not sure if it’s related, but it all began after a USB flash drive got stuck. After that a phantom drive E appeared, and I couldn’t delete it no matter what I tried. If I plugged that flash drive back in, everything would freeze, programs stopped responding, hard drives couldn’t read or write. Also, it suddenly broke down Android emulator showed a black screen, and even old games, like Vampire: The Masquerade, Skyrim, Sims 4, started running at 20–30 FPS with constant stuttering. I noticed that the FPS dropped the most when there were more light sources on screen. The more objects in the light, the lower the fps.\n\nSo, I went with the simple solution and completely reinstalled Windows formatted all drives. After that, I noticed something weird. Windows itself felt a bit sluggish. And that phantom E drive came back, showing up as a hard drive. But I only have two real drives C and D. In Device Manager it appears as SMI USB Reader Device, which I don’t remember seeing before. Disabling and deleted it changes nothing. I installed GPU drivers, thinking that would fix problem. But computer continues to slow down. Then I reinstalled Windows again, and installed DirectX, all Visual C++, and updated my chipset and motherboard drivers. Now computer boots very fast, but the games are still lagging exactly the same. I tried multiple versions of GPU drivers - no difference. I ran MSI Afterburner, checked GPU and CPU loads during games - both are fine, temperatures normal. I ran memory and disk checks - no errors. I have no idea what’s going on.

The device is fully functional in terms of power, connectivity, and controls, but I’ve been experiencing an ongoing audio interruption problem. Every 20 to 30 seconds, all audio output from the headset stops abruptly. The connection itself remains active, with the system audio and the headset’s controls still responding, but sound only resumes once I manually adjust the volume level up or down. This cycle repeats continuously during use, regardless of the application or sound source. It has become very annoying and impossible to listen to music or perform basic tasks.",

    "selftext": "For a quick overview I finally decided to upgrade to windows 11 on my PC. To do so I needed to enable the AMD CPU fTPM and Secure Boot in Bios which went fine. Ever since the update my PC will now randomly shut off with an error message. In windows event Viewer it always shows the source as Kernel Power. I cannot figure out what is wrong. This never happened when I was on windows 10 and only started happening after the windows 11 update two weeks ago. There doesnt seem to be a specific reason the crash happens. For instance I use my PC for a lot of video editing and I constantly get this error when importing clips to premier pro from my external SSD which causes it to crash, the PC also tends to crash when Im not really doing anything on it like If im sitting on my phone not using the PC with google pulled up it will crash. Conversely some heavily demanding applications dont cause any crashing I play the new battlefield on high graphical settings with a discord call pulled up and it has never had a problem but I tried to upload a YT short this morning and it caused a crash. \n\n  \nA couple of things Ive already done/ tried:\n\n\\- Updated all drivers\n\n\\- Updated Bios\n\n\\- Ensured PSU cables are securely connected\n\n\\- Reinstalled Windows 11\n\n\\- Deleted media cache, reset preferences, and reinstalled premier pro\n\n\\- Trouble shoot windows update: no problems found\n\n\\- SFC Scan: completed multiple times (no problems)\n\n\\- DISM Scan: completed multiple times (no problems)\n\n\\- Removed peripherals and it did nothing (had no problems in windows 10 with them either)\n\n\\- Malware and security scans: no problems\n\n\\- Over 500 GB of disk storage available so its not a memory issue\n\nAt this point im out of ideas and wondering if anyone had a similar issue or knows what to do short of a full system reset. Im thinking of just buying a new PC at this point because the system is about 5 years old anyways and I was thinking about upgrading. This is insane to me that I never had this issue once with windows 10 and now its a non stop problem with Win 11.\n\n  \nPC Specs:\n\nGPU: Nvidia RTX 3060Ti\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X\n\nMobo: Gigabyte B550 UD AC VER: 1.0\n\nRam: T-force 32 GB\n\n  \nI appreciate anything you can do to help!",

Then I noticed an intermittent \"ticking/clicking\" sound every 10-15 seconds or so even when browsing the web, but thought it was my Lian-li infinity fans.\n\nThen this morning, I looked under the GPU and noticed the left fan is spinning, but the right one doesn't budge at all. I caught it twitch for a second once or twice, but that's about it.\n\nCould the clicking I hear every 10-20 seconds be the GPU trying to kick the right fan on? I have unplugged the power cable to the GPU and reattached the power cable to the 12V 2x6 port on my 1300W Lian Li Edge PSU.\n\nAttached is a video of the sound I'm hearing. I used Afterburner to set fans to anything and the right fan just does not move at all. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/mAPoceb](https://imgur.com/a/mAPoceb)\n\nUnsure what my next steps should be besides contact NVIDIA or if there's some type of user error here. I'm using the included power cable with the Lian Li 1300W PSU, a \"12V-2X6\" cable.",

That might be it.\n\nSo for a little bit, I’ve had sound effects or little bursts of music coming from my computer, and closing every application didn’t get rid of it. I’d even go into task manager and look for any open tasks (I didn’t check background tasks). The only thing that would fix it was resetting my computer, but then it’d come back at some point in the future.\n\nIt happened again today, and I was done with it, so I ran (another) full scan. While doing that I looked through all my files and deleted anything suspicious. Might have been a good thing, cause I found other, unrelated possible viruses. Anyway, nothing fixed the music, so I went back into task manager and looked at all the background processes, and looked into each one that used any memory or CPU. I saw Game Jolt and skipped over it, because it’s just a game downloading app. I found nothing, so I did a second comb through.\n\nGame Jolt was using quite a bit of memory, so I thought I’d end the task, and when I did, the music stopped. I opened Game Jolt again and went to a random horror game, then closed the app. Of course, the jump scare sound effect from the game’s trailer was still playing in a loop. If you have Game Jolt, this might be the reason.",

When the firmware crashes during POST or update, the Omen can enter protection mode — it cuts power to prevent full BIOS brick. At that point the EC refuses to start or charge until the BIOS is reflashed with HP’s service tool.\n\nNext steps I plan:\n\nLeave it unplugged overnight to fully discharge.\n\nTry Win + B/V recovery again tomorrow.\n\nIf still dead, contact HP for a BIOS reflash or mainboard replacement (seems to be a known Omen issue).\n\n\nAnyone seen this exact pattern before or managed a solution?\n\n",

Windows also doesn't give options for any brightness-related settings.\n\nThe solutions I tried:\n\nchanged ports - HDMI and VGA are the only available ports, and I also tried different cablesupdating drivers (obviously because this is a fresh install) - I just said it's 99% not an OS thing but what if\n\nI don't want to buy a new monitor yet because I haven't even tested any solutions available yet.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbaang7ca4wf1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f95843b0f30c48635f7b7a04c1d9814e13ce4107\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ouv5qwaga4wf1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dfed36c4679a11396aba084c20499da4e1c1e1f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bt0q5q5ia4wf1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3d3735476e7bfd0cc9b04cc516803b169692536",

Couldn't install Windows 11 with the USB I bought at the computer store. I could only go as far as selecting which partition to install the OS before encountering a BSOD.\n\nThe BSODs I remember seeing were:\n\n\\- IQRL is not less than or equal to zero (something like that)\n\n\\- Internal Cache/caching error \n\n\\- Memory error\n\n\\- I know I saw another unique BSOD, but I can't remember what it was. \n\nI asked my IT friend, and he suggested updating the system BIOS.\n\n\n\nI did the following:\n\n1. Went to the manufacturer's website. (MSI)\n\n2. Selected my motherboard. (X870E)\n\n3. Downloaded and extracted the latest BIOS onto a USB drive. (BIOS 7E...)\n\nThe motherboard had a BIOS dated to October of last year, and this new one is from last month. \n\n4. Updated the BIOS. \n\n5. Computer bricks: no screen, mouse, or keyboard.\n\nRestarting the computer returns a CPU and DDRM failure.\n\n6. Friend suggested using CMOS to reset the board, but it didn't work. \n\n  \nWhen tech support replaced the motherboard and used ALL trusted parts, essentially building a brand new PC, it still has motherboard issues. I'm not sure whether to be livid or astonished at this point because it stopped making sense 2 days ago; now they're suggesting the Win11 USB is bad.\n\nI'm not sure how to handle this problem anymore because it feels like the tech support guys are now spouting a bunch of BS to me. I bought a warranty with the board where it's being repaired, but I'm halfway to asking for it back to have another store look at it, or at least trade in my current board/entire PC for a different one. My PC has been in the shop for a week now, and it's unlikely I'll get it back soon. \n\nThis doesn't distinctly feel like a software or hardware issue, so I'll call it a firmware issue, I guess. I'll take any advice as to what to do next, or comments on how unusual/impossible this situation seems.",

    "selftext": "As the titles says I've been having this problem with my laptop screen freezing when moved or tilted and sometimes if a video is on when it does freeze I hear a loud high pitched sound and the only solution is to force shut down and restart. I took it to repairs before but they claimed there was nothing wrong and just did routine cleaning which improved my overheating(my other problem but also I'm now using a cooling pad so it's not a bother anymore). It did fix the problem for a few days before it came back progressively. I tried to adapt by keeping my laptop opened all time and not moving or tilting it to not induce the freeze. I'm traveling pretty soon and since I don't know any trustworthy repair there I was wondereing If I should take it to a different place again or if it won't break my laptop by leaving the problem unsolved. Also if anybody has any idea what's the most possible cause and if it can be fixed. And thank you!",

Windows was initially loaded onto my computer but last night I realized in settings it said Windows was not actually downloaded. After some research I realized this is common with bootleg Windows purchases. My concern is, Windows defender started picking up “Trojan horse” files. I did a complete reset of the PC to remove any infected files. After the reset, I’ve done multiple scans for viruses (complete scan and offline scan) and all have come up clean. Is my PC safe, or is there chance there is still malware. New to computers so any insight would be so helpful thank you! ",

    "selftext": "Last night, I was using my PC just fine. I was recently forced to \"upgrade\" to Windows 11, and it's been rough since. Basically, it just.. crashed? Out of nowhere? Something to do with the bios, I think. I'm stuck in a boot loop, where it says it's gonna restart, but never does. I've tried spamming F12, F8, nothing. I would be able to likely fix this, if I can just access the bios. My keyboard and mouse turn off though, the second I try to use them. Completely unresponsive. I know they turn off, cause they briefly light up when I turn on the PC, only to shut off when I need them. Believe me, I've tried spamming the keys in that brief window. Nothing. I've tried taking out and re-inserting my CMOS battery. Nothing. I'm honestly at a loss.. I have a Linux laptop. I used it to flash a copy of Windows 11. Without a working keyboard and mouse, though, it's basically pointless. I don't know why the keyboard and mouse won't function. They're not broken, and I've tried swapping with every port available. Nothing. Any advice would be much appreciated.\n\nSince I can't post photos, here's the message. \n\nYour device ran into a problem and needs to restart.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone! I need some advice if this is a hardware problem. We have an older router model, which is AN5506-04-FA. The WiFi connection really won't work, and both the 2.5G and 5G indicator lights are not lit. This started happening during frequent brownouts and sudden fluctuations in electricity due to power outages. I have tried all possible fixes, including watching YouTube tutorials and asking AI. Here are what I have done:\n\n* Accessed the Admin Panel (192.168.1.1) - enabled the RADIO and SSID.\n* Hard reset and enabled RADIO and SSID using an Ethernet cable.\n* Pressed the WLAN and WLAN buttons at the back and waited for the lights to turn on. I pressed for 5 seconds then released, waited 30 seconds then released, but the lights still won't turn on. Restarted the modem and tried pressing for 5 seconds, 30 seconds, or even 2 minutes, but still no lights.\n\nIt's really hassle, because even though the admin panel indicates that broadcast is ON and SSID is enabled, the lights still won't turn on. Also, pressing the WLAN and WLAN2 buttons at the back of the router doesn't turn on the lights. Does it need a replacement router? Thank you very much in advance for your advice!  \n[](https://preview.redd.it/pldt-fibr-router-wifi-problem-need-tips-v0-7b4j302lj3wf1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc1f073de2483ccc4081888c52ca3a5981b01b12)",

My normal documents, images folders don’t contain any of cloud files, but in the onedrive folder there are some. If there was onedrive backup question on windows setup i probably denied it. Can i just go into local onedrive folder and delete these files? I am asking because last time on my older installation of windows deletion of these files messed up my normal folders. And if i mess with these files they won’t appear or try to invade my normal folders?\n\nThanks in advance ❤️",

Even when I’m **not signed into Google** (Incognito mode), YouTube shows my location as **IL (Israel)**  in the Topleft above the Logo. instead of DE (Germany). I also get Israeli ads. My wife’s laptop, connected to the **same Wi-Fi network**, shows the correct location **DE**.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n1. Checked my **IP address** via multiple services → all show **Bonn, Germany**.\n2. Cleared **browser cache and cookies** → still IL.\n3. Tested in **Incognito mode** → still IL.\n4. Tried **Firefox** (never really used it) → still IL.\n5. Did a **DNS flush** and `ipconfig /renew` → still IL.\n6. Checked my **Google account location** → it was set to Israel, I corrected it to Germany, but the issue **persists in Incognito / not logged in**.\n7. Checked for **VPN / Proxy / system-wide Adblockers** → nothing active at the moment.\n\nIt only happens on this specific PC. Other devices on the same network display the correct location.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea why YouTube keeps detecting my PC as being in Israel, and how I can fix it permanently? Could it be some kind of **system-level DNS / routing / leftover VPN configuration**?\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance!",

I know they turn off, cause they briefly light up when I turn on the PC, only to shut off when I need them. Believe me, I've tried spamming the keys in that brief window. Nothing. I've tried taking out and re-inserting my CMOS battery. Nothing. I'm honestly at a loss.. I have a Linux laptop. I used it to flash a copy of Windows 11.

(I have been told this is a windows issue)\n\nThe problem:\n\nI bought battlefield 6 on launch day, and for the first day or so I had no problems. Then a day or two later, I can't exactly remember when, my audio started clicking really badly.\n\nLoud pops, dropouts, etc.\n\nThis was happening with my Astro A50 wireless headset, I believe the gen 2 variation.\n\nAfter some digging I couldn't really find a fix so I opted to buy some HyperX Cloud 3's while I wait for a fix to come out. Plugged them into my usb port, and the same thing happened. Tried the audio jack and it was fixed. \n\nFlash forward a week later, and I got a new webcam today, the logitech Brio 101. Also plugged in through USB, and when using it while playing battlefield 6 it has these white line flickers and the image very often becomes unrecognizable or very distorted\n\nAs soon as I close battlefield, the issue stops entirely. This has become increasingly frustrating and I genuinely do not understand why this is happening.\n\nSorry if the formatting is off I don't really use reddit all that much.\n\nIf anyone else is having a similar issue, I would really appreciate some insight on how to fix this.

If I plugged that flash drive back in, everything would freeze, programs stopped responding, hard drives couldn’t read or write. Also, it suddenly broke down Android emulator showed a black screen, and even old games, like Vampire: The Masquerade, Skyrim, Sims 4, started running at 20–30 FPS with constant stuttering. I noticed that the FPS dropped the most when there were more light sources on screen. The more objects in the light, the lower the fps.\n\nSo, I went with the simple solution and completely reinstalled Windows formatted all drives. After that, I noticed something weird. Windows itself felt a bit sluggish. And that phantom E drive came back, showing up as a hard drive. But I only have two real drives C and D.

Now computer boots very fast, but the games are still lagging exactly the same. I tried multiple versions of GPU drivers - no difference.

I could be playing a game, on youtube/google, or even idle sometimes. It doesn't blue screen, whatever is on my monitor at the time, it stops.\n\nAfter about 10 secs the computer will restart. The restart screen doesn't have a background like usual, its a blue background. Then i restart once more, then the background comes back.\n\nI checked drivers, updated bios etc.\n\nI called support and in the event viewer the only log was that it was an unexpected shutdown. Nothing more.\n\nAfter doing some tests, i found that it could be a power issue. So I bought a surge protector that can handle high voltage.\n\nBut it still happens.\n\nI think if its not a power issue it could be a gpu issue. When i play games they always slow down, the audio gets crispy. While playing BF6 I turned on the event graphs and FPS monitor. And the CPU tanks. \n\nI turned the graphics card to Gen4 from Gen5 in the bios as there have been known issues with 5070ti.\n\nI am all out of ideas, I believe that the two are connected.\n\nCan anyone help me, I use my pc for work.\n\nBelow are my PC specs, any additional info i can share please let me know.\n\nThanks for any help.\n\n[https://gpuz.techpowerup.com/25/10/19/us5.png](https://gpuz.techpowerup.com/25/10/19/us5.png) \n\n[https://gpuz.techpowerup.com/25/10/19/vb6.png](https://gpuz.techpowerup.com/25/10/19/vb6.png)\n\n[https://gpuz.techpowerup.com/25/10/19/ey8.png](https://gpuz.techpowerup.com/25/10/19/ey8.png)\n\nHopefully you can see the image, i used GPUZ.",

    "selftext": "For a quick overview I finally decided to upgrade to windows 11 on my PC. To do so I needed to enable the AMD CPU fTPM and Secure Boot in Bios which went fine. Ever since the update my PC will now randomly shut off with an error message. In windows event Viewer it always shows the source as Kernel Power. I cannot figure out what is wrong. This never happened when I was on windows 10 and only started happening after the windows 11 update two weeks ago. There doesnt seem to be a specific reason the crash happens. For instance I use my PC for a lot of video editing and I constantly get this error when importing clips to premier pro from my external SSD which causes it to crash, the PC also tends to crash when Im not really doing anything on it like If im sitting on my phone not using the PC with google pulled up it will crash. Conversely some heavily demanding applications dont cause any crashing I play the new battlefield on high graphical settings with a discord call pulled up and it has never had a problem but I tried to upload a YT short this morning and it caused a crash. \n\n  \nA couple of things Ive already done/ tried:\n\n\\- Updated all drivers\n\n\\- Updated Bios\n\n\\- Ensured PSU cables are securely connected\n\n\\- Reinstalled Windows 11\n\n\\- Deleted media cache, reset preferences, and reinstalled premier pro\n\n\\- Trouble shoot windows update: no problems found\n\n\\- SFC Scan: completed multiple times (no problems)\n\n\\- DISM Scan: completed multiple times (no problems)\n\n\\- Removed peripherals and it did nothing (had no problems in windows 10 with them either)\n\n\\- Malware and security scans: no problems\n\n\\- Over 500 GB of disk storage available so its not a memory issue\n\nAt this point im out of ideas and wondering if anyone had a similar issue or knows what to do short of a full system reset. Im thinking of just buying a new PC at this point because the system is about 5 years old anyways and I was thinking about upgrading. This is insane to me that I never had this issue once with windows 10 and now its a non stop problem with Win 11.\n\n  \nPC Specs:\n\nGPU: Nvidia RTX 3060Ti\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X\n\nMobo: Gigabyte B550 UD AC VER: 1.0\n\nRam: T-force 32 GB\n\n  \nI appreciate anything you can do to help!",

I caught it twitch for a second once or twice, but that's about it.\n\nCould the clicking I hear every 10-20 seconds be the GPU trying to kick the right fan on? I have unplugged the power cable to the GPU and reattached the power cable to the 12V 2x6 port on my 1300W Lian Li Edge PSU.\n\nAttached is a video of the sound I'm hearing. I used Afterburner to set fans to anything and the right fan just does not move at all. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/mAPoceb](https://imgur.com/a/mAPoceb)\n\nUnsure what my next steps should be besides contact NVIDIA or if there's some type of user error here.

    "selftext": "So I don’t know who needs to see this, but hopefully this will be helpful.\n\nTL;DR: if you have GameJolt, end the task under “background tasks” in task manager. That might be it.\n\nSo for a little bit, I’ve had sound effects or little bursts of music coming from my computer, and closing every application didn’t get rid of it. I’d even go into task manager and look for any open tasks (I didn’t check background tasks). The only thing that would fix it was resetting my computer, but then it’d come back at some point in the future.\n\nIt happened again today, and I was done with it, so I ran (another) full scan. While doing that I looked through all my files and deleted anything suspicious. Might have been a good thing, cause I found other, unrelated possible viruses. Anyway, nothing fixed the music, so I went back into task manager and looked at all the background processes, and looked into each one that used any memory or CPU. I saw Game Jolt and skipped over it, because it’s just a game downloading app. I found nothing, so I did a second comb through.\n\nGame Jolt was using quite a bit of memory, so I thought I’d end the task, and when I did, the music stopped. I opened Game Jolt again and went to a random horror game, then closed the app. Of course, the jump scare sound effect from the game’s trailer was still playing in a loop. If you have Game Jolt, this might be the reason.",

Even when I’m **not signed into Google** (Incognito mode), YouTube shows my location as **IL (Israel)**  in the Topleft above the Logo. instead of DE (Germany). I also get Israeli ads. My wife’s laptop, connected to the **same Wi-Fi network**, shows the correct location **DE**.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n1. Checked my **IP address** via multiple services → all show **Bonn, Germany**.\n2. Cleared **browser cache and cookies** → still IL.\n3. Tested in **Incognito mode** → still IL.\n4. Tried **Firefox** (never really used it) → still IL.\n5. Did a **DNS flush** and `ipconfig /renew` → still IL.\n6. Checked my **Google account location** → it was set to Israel, I corrected it to Germany, but the issue **persists in Incognito / not logged in**.\n7. Checked for **VPN / Proxy / system-wide Adblockers** → nothing active at the moment.\n\nIt only happens on this specific PC. Other devices on the same network display the correct location.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea why YouTube keeps detecting my PC as being in Israel, and how I can fix it permanently? Could it be some kind of **system-level DNS / routing / leftover VPN configuration**?\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance!",

Moreover, the device won't connect to the internet (neither wifi nor wired work).\n\nI've tried restarting it several times, a couple times the settings would manage to open and would seemingly work normally, but would also start lagging and crash if i try to open the \"network\" tab. Moreover, when i try to click on the network icon on my taskbar, sometimes it just opens a blank window that won't dissapear.\n\nI have no idea what could be causing this, it was just like this when i woke the laptop up. Everything else seems to be working fine so i imagine it isn't a hardware issue.",

For a couple of months, I've been receiving sporadically (about once every six weeks) attempts to log into my Instagram, but I never paid any attention to it because maybe they were using the wrong email address or something. Today, however, while I was on Instagram, I noticed both a message telling me my OTP to log in and a pop-up telling me I'd been logged out. I quickly logged out of all my connected devices (which were all mine, but you never know) and changed my password. The problem is, someone had managed to change my Instagram login email to one of those temp ones (logmailz). Fast forward two hours later, they're trying to break into my Amazon account.\n\nProbable causes? Solutions? Now I'm scared because I feel like I could be hacked at any moment.",

(Updated BIOS as well)\n\nOtherwise at the moment I have no issues asides from the occasional screen tearing in applications using hardware acceleration. (I have been told this is a windows issue)\n\nThe problem:\n\nI bought battlefield 6 on launch day, and for the first day or so I had no problems. Then a day or two later, I can't exactly remember when, my audio started clicking really badly.\n\nLoud pops, dropouts, etc.\n\nThis was happening with my Astro A50 wireless headset, I believe the gen 2 variation.\n\nAfter some digging I couldn't really find a fix so I opted to buy some HyperX Cloud 3's while I wait for a fix to come out. Plugged them into my usb port, and the same thing happened. Tried the audio jack and it was fixed. \n\nFlash forward a week later, and I got a new webcam today, the logitech Brio 101. Also plugged in through USB, and when using it while playing battlefield 6 it has these white line flickers and the image very often becomes unrecognizable or very distorted\n\nAs soon as I close battlefield, the issue stops entirely. This has become increasingly frustrating and I genuinely do not understand why this is happening.\n\nSorry if the formatting is off I don't really use reddit all that much.\n\nIf anyone else is having a similar issue, I would really appreciate some insight on how to fix this.
