    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "title": "iPhone & Wi-Fi 7",
    "selftext": "> For those unaware, Apple claims that the iPhone 16 and 17 series support 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), but in practice this is **highly limited** compared with the full standard.  \n>  \n> **Wi-Fi 7‚Äôs most important technical features include:**  \n>  \n> ‚Ä¢ **Up to 240 MHz channel width on the 5 GHz band**  \n> ‚Ä¢ **Up to 320 MHz channel width on the 6 GHz band**  \n> ‚Ä¢ **4096-QAM modulation**  \n> ‚Ä¢ **MLMR MLO (Multi-Link Multi-Radio)** capable of aggregating multiple Wi-Fi bands into one high-throughput pipeline  \n>  \n> While Apple meets the *minimum certification requirement* (MLSR MLO), it disables nearly all optional features that make Wi-Fi 7 truly high-performance. As a result, **iPhone 16 and 17 models perform at speeds comparable to Wi-Fi 6/6E**, while other flagship phones achieve **3‚Äì4√ó higher throughput** using the optional features Apple ignored for two generations.  \n>  \n> For context, Wi-Fi 6/6E tops out at **160 MHz-wide channels**, **1024-QAM modulation**, and only one Wi-Fi band at a time ‚Äî yielding peak theoretical speeds around **2402 Mbps**.  \n>  \n> Wi-Fi 7, when fully implemented, doubles channel width to 320 MHz, quadruples QAM density to 4096, and enables **true multi-band operation via MLO**, dramatically increasing real-world throughput.  \n>  \n> Apple‚Äôs iPhones, however, still restrict channels to 160 MHz, leave QAM at 1024, and only use MLO as a basic failover mechanism ‚Äî effectively **Wi-Fi 6/6E with rudimentary band steering**.  \n>  \n> Some argue that wider channels, higher QAM, or MLMR MLO would drain battery. While Apple may have designed these limits intentionally, other flagship phones fully enable these features **without widespread battery complaints**, showing it‚Äôs a feasible design choice.  \n>  \n> Others claim that 5 GHz doesn‚Äôt support 240 MHz channels ‚Äî but in regions like the **United States**, access points can operate at 240 MHz on 5 GHz, and Apple‚Äôs iPhones simply don‚Äôt take advantage of it.  \n>  \n> Apple‚Äôs documentation confirms that the Broadcom chip in the iPhone 16 series and the N1 chip in the iPhone 17 series are **capped to a single 160 MHz band**. Meanwhile, users have observed the performance discrepancy across multiple forums and reviews:  \n>  \n> ‚Ä¢ [Jason Deegan review](https://jasondeegan.com/iphone-16-review-disappointment-with-wifi-7-performance/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [Apple forum complaints](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255812908?sortBy=rank)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [MacRumors forum complaints](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-buy-wifi7-router.2438418/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [Apple's official tech specs of 16 & 17 series](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/wi-fi-ethernet-specifications-apple-devices-dep268652e6c/web)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [TP-Link Community complaints](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/705570)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [YouTube comparison of the 16 series](https://youtu.be/07FRuS67iD8)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [YouTube comparison of the 17 series](https://youtu.be/VtimPHdiv7U)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [YouTube warning not to buy Wi-Fi 7 routers](https://youtube.com/shorts/Pc3dAEoPPFo)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/apple-n1-chip-has-wi-fi-7-limitation/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [5GStore analysis](https://5gstore.com/blog/2025/09/16/apple-n1-chip-wifi-7-iphone-17/#what-wccftech-found-apples-n-1-chip-its-limitation)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [PhoneArena article](https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-16-pro-models-prevented-from-reaching-full-wi-fi-7-potential_id163151)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [iThinkDiff article](https://www.ithinkdiff.com/apple-n1-chip-iphone-17-wifi-7-limit/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [iPhoneWired article](https://iphonewired.com/news/857921/)  \n>  \n> In conclusion, many users invest in premium iPhones and Wi-Fi 7 equipment expecting the full benefits of the standard.

    "title": "The iPhone Upgrade Program is absolutely NOT compatible with AppleCare One",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR: DO NOT try and add your iPhone Upgrade Program iPhone to AppleCare One, unless you want significant problems down the road.**\n\nI added my 16 Pro to AppleCare One in July, a few days after the program started. The support specialist read me boilerplate along the lines of \"In order to remain enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program, you must immediately add your phone to AppleCare One to ensure no gap in coverage\". I did that, got a gift card back for \\~$120, and felt happy with myself.\n\nI successfully used the program to get a 17 Pro a few weeks ago, which I picked up in store. However, when I came to return the 16 Pro, the phone was marked as \"Enrolled in iPhone Upgrade Program\", but the option to close the loan was greyed out with \"loan details not found\". The store associates, up to and including supervisors were very confused by this and hadn't seen it before.\n\nAfter approximately **11 hours** on the phone with Citizens, and Apple Support, speaking with about 15 different people, all of whom were very friendly, but none of whom had any idea what had happened, and **3 visits** to the store, I was eventually advised to return the phone as a standalone trade-in, and receive a store gift card. I then had to call a special escalated support number and have them cancel the gift card and close the loan. (It still ended with a 4¬¢ balance, which I then had to pay Citizens by credit card üòÖ)\n\nI eventually had final confirmation from that escalated support line that, despite what AppleCare specialists tell you, and despite the boilerplate coverage language, cancelling the Theft and Loss protection to put your phone into AppleCare One **immediately** cancels the Upgrade Program eligibility. Obviously some systems are aware of this (allowing me to upgrade to 17 Pro), and some are not (preventing me from returning 16 Pro).\n\nI asked about the 17 Pro and confirmed that it too had been removed from the program. They advised me to do a Closed Box return in store and then immediately re-buy the same phone through the program to get it back into eligibility. I tried this, and while I passed the credit check and managed to keep my same phone, Verizon refused to activate the line (presumably because it was already connected - to me). As a result, I couldn't complete the transaction, and ended up having to re-buy my phone outright.\n\nTo Apple's credit, they recognized what a clusterfuck this was, and gave me a credit of $250, which I used for some AirPods Pro 3, and the guy in-store also gave me an Ultra Watch band for free. I also ended up with a negative loan balance of $260, which I got back as a check, and when you add back the $120 gift card back from July, I ended up doing ok. \n\nBut, it was an incredible time and energy suck and I did have to drop $1400 all in one go. I am lucky that I could just do that otherwise I would have left the store without my phone and then who knows what would have happened. I do not recommend this adventure to anyone. \n\nHopefully by the time the next phones are released there will be a proper integrated upgrade path, but for now, if you want to preserve your sanity, just stick with Theft and Loss coverage.\n\n ",

    "title": "Hazel is overkill for 90% of users. Mine works in 3 clicks.",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple! üëã\n\nI'm excited to share Neatify, a macOS productivity app I've been working on for automatic file organization.\n\n# \"Wait, isn't this just Hazel?\"\n\nFair question. I know Hazel exists, and it's an incredibly powerful tool. But here's the thing: Hazel is built for people who love to customize every detail. **Neatify is built for people who want their files organized instantly, without setup or scripting.**\n\n**I made Neatify for people who:**\n\n* Value automation that works right away\n* Want images in one folder, PDFs in another, done\n* Prefer project-based file routing without extra configuration\n* Want clarity instead of complexity\n\nThink of it this way: Hazel is a custom-built PC. Neatify is a MacBook that just works.\n\nBoth are powerful, but one lets you skip the setup and get things done faster.\n\nIf you enjoy building complex automation workflows, Hazel is fantastic. If you just want your files to go where they belong while you focus on your work, Neatify is built for you.\n\n# The Problem I'm Solving\n\nYou're working on multiple projects simultaneously. Literature essay, art history presentation, geopolitics research paper. Files are everywhere. Downloads folder is chaos. Every time you save or download something, you face decision fatigue: \"Where should this go?\"\n\nYou could use Hazel, but after 30 minutes of documentation and rule setup, you're more overwhelmed than when you started.\n\n# How Neatify Works\n\n**üéØ Project-Based Organization**\n\nCreate a project structure in 3 clicks:\n\n1. Name your project (e.g., \"Literature Essay\")\n2. Select file types to manage (Images, PDFs, Presentations)\n3. Choose location (Desktop, Documents, wherever)\n\nDone. Now every image you download automatically goes to Literature Essay/Images. Every PDF to Literature Essay/PDFs. No manual sorting.\n\n**‚ö°Ô∏è Smart File Sorting with Saved Rules**\n\nCreate reusable sorting configurations. One for work, one for personal files, one for creative projects. Switch between them from the menu bar in one click.\n\n**üîÑ Quick Sorter**\n\nNeed to organize something right now? Quick Sorter lets you point at a folder, pick file types, and start sorting immediately. Perfect for one-off tasks.\n\n**üßπ Bulk File Organizer**\n\nGot a messy folder with 500 mixed files? Select it, and Neatify reorganizes everything into a clean structure (Visual/Images, Visual/Videos, Audio, Code/Frontend, Code/Backend, Documents, etc.) in seconds.\n\n**üöÄ Set It and Forget It**\n\nEnable \"Launch at Login\" with a default project or rule. Neatify runs silently in your menu bar. Your files stay organized without you thinking about it.\n\n**üìä Menu Bar Control**\n\nClose the app, it lives in your menu bar. Switch sorting rules, pause/resume, or check status without opening the main window.\n\n# Why I Built This\n\nI was constantly switching between projects and drowning in file chaos. I tried Hazel, spent hours configuring it, felt more stressed, and thought: \"There has to be a simpler way.\"\n\nSo I built Neatify to do one thing really well: keep your files organized so you can focus on your work, not your folders.\n\nIt's 100% native macOS (Swift + SwiftUI), optimized for performance, and follows Apple's design language. No Electron bloat.\n\n# Try the Beta\n\nNeatify is currently in public beta on TestFlight. I'd genuinely love your feedback, especially from anyone who's tried Hazel and found it too heavy, or anyone juggling multiple projects who's tired of file chaos.\n\nBeta Access: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/Eyp3uwZS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Eyp3uwZS)  \nWebsite: [https://neatifyhq.com](https://neatifyhq.com)  \nDemo: [https://neatifyhq.com/#demo](https://neatifyhq.com/#demo)\n\nI'd Love Your Thoughts On\n\n* Does the \"simpler alternative to Hazel\" positioning make sense?\n* What file organization pain points do you face daily?\n* For Hazel users: what would make you consider a faster, easier tool?\n* Any concerns about automatic file management?\n\nI'll be here all day answering questions, discussing workflows, or debating the merits of different organization philosophies. Thanks for reading! üôè",

    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

    "selftext": "I know this might be a dumb question, but why didn't the lightning port ever improve in data transfers or charging capability? \n\nGranted this is anecdotal, but I thought the lightning port was superior from a physical perspective. I've  had USB-C loosen over time and have seen them get destroyed by there hollow design but the lightning port was a plug that you didn't have to worry about as much and was easier to clean. Why at least not make it a little bigger on a redesign or something to compete? I like USB-C, but I was always curious why Apple never continued to innovate a good port and cash cow.",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

I also like to hope that we'll see an iPhone fold (which Apple will almost certainly not sell as fold, it'll probably be something like iPhone Arc or iPhone Omni or something; just like they called the Air Air instead of slim).

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n‚Äã\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

But never used it before. \n\nFrom what I read, we can take it to apple for it to be repaired for a fee, or request and express replacement for a bit higher fee where they send a replacement and you post your phone number \n\nWhat happens when they repair yours? Do they then send it back, you swap again, and send the replacement back?\n\nWhen they repair yours phone due to a broken glass, do they also replace the battery (automatically or upon request)? As it‚Äôs 90% already, it would be a good opportunity to get a refresh battery. \n\nIf we get a refurbished replacement, do they always come with a new battery?\n\nI read online that people just smash up their phone to get a new one or dip it in water, it just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me but I really would like the battery to be refreshed (as it dropped to 90% rather quickly) or get a refurbished one without feeling too bad ethically. What is the best way? ",

Do they then send it back, you swap again, and send the replacement back?\n\nWhen they repair yours phone due to a broken glass, do they also replace the battery (automatically or upon request)? As it‚Äôs 90% already, it would be a good opportunity to get a refresh battery. \n\nIf we get a refurbished replacement, do they always come with a new battery?\n\nI read online that people just smash up their phone to get a new one or dip it in water, it just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me but I really would like the battery to be refreshed (as it dropped to 90% rather quickly) or get a refurbished one without feeling too bad ethically. What is the best way? ",

I'm finding it difficult to navigate with display zoom enabled but the screen otherwise it's too small for my eyes so I'm trying to decide if I return this phone for a 17 pro max. The problem is I wanted a smaller phone because the 12 promax was starting to really hurt my hands and just was overall too big, especially for one-handed text.

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android üëã,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to¬†**WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is¬†**SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Compared to traditional Linux distros, Android is very restricted, the newer versions even more so, it is very hard to root too. So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

    "selftext": "I've never owned a galaxy S8 (used apple, oneplus, pixel, then my first samsung was my current s24 ultra), but I feel like it's the most influential Android phone in the last 10 years in terms of physical design. It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

    "selftext": "Would love to know some tips and tricks from the experts who have turned and twisted android to create something personal and functional. \n\n\nInitial impressions for me: (First 2 days)\nWhat's better in Android:\n1) The key board - I am not making as many mistakes as I used to when typing on the 14 pro\n2) Autofilling of OTPs - just removed one more step and feels faster \n3) Pixel animations are smooth and fast - atleast better than my 14 pro and my friends 15 pro \n4) Google assistant/ Gemini is just way better \n5) loving the battery on the 10 xl compared to the smaller 14 pro \n6) The universal back gesture. Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

    "selftext": "Hi all! I've been working on something I think you'll find useful. **Media Bar** transforms your Android status bar into a functional media controller and progress indicator.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nInstead of pulling down notifications or switching apps to control your music/podcast/video, you can now:\n\n* **See media progress** as a thin colored bar along your status bar\n* **Swipe left/right** on the status bar to scrub through your media\n* **Tap, double-tap, or long-press** three invisible regions on the status bar for custom actions (play/pause, skip, jump forward/back, launch app, etc.)\n\n**How is this different from Android's Live Notifications or OneUI's Now Bar?**\n\nWhile Android's live notifications and Samsung's Now Bar are excellent features, Media Bar takes a different approach:\n\n* **Always visible, minimal footprint** \\- Just a thin line on your status bar (can be as small as 1 pixel), not a pill or expandable widget that takes screen real estate\n* **Blind muscle memory control** \\- Your entire status bar becomes an interactive surface. No need to look for or tap specific small buttons\n* **Works system-wide** \\- Doesn't matter which media app you're using or which Android skin you have\n* **Swipe to scrub** \\- Directly scrub through your media by swiping, rather than tapping skip buttons\n* **Deep customization** \\- Color coding for progress tracking, custom button zones, transparency options, etc.\n\nThink of it as complementary to those features - it's for when you want the most minimal, muscle-memory-based control possible.\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nI found myself constantly interrupting my workflow to control media playback - whether I was gaming, browsing, or working. I wanted something that was always visible and accessible without being intrusive.\n\n**The \"aha\" moment:**\n\nHere's the thing - **Media Bar might feel a bit unusual at first, but give it a day or two.** Once your muscle memory kicks in, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.\n\nImagine this: You're at the gym mid-rep and need to pause your music. Instead of fumbling to find the play button, your thumb just *knows* where to tap on the status bar. Or you're deep into a 3-hour podcast and want to skip ahead - a quick swipe does it without even looking.\n\n**That's the magic**: your fingers learn the zones, and suddenly media control becomes second nature. No more hunting for tiny buttons or pulling focus from what you're doing. It just... flows. I'm confident that once it becomes part of your routine, it'll feel indispensable.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n**Color coding options** \\- Solid colors, dynamic (based on album art/app), segments (changes color at different progress points), or gradients\n\n**Highly customizable** \\- Adjust the bar's thickness (down to 1 pixel!), position (top/bottom), transparency, button regions, and more\n\n**Smart behavior** \\- Auto-hides in fullscreen apps, works with any media player\n\nIf you want to give it a shot, [get it from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.mediabar)! I would love to hear what you guys think about it and happy to answer any questions you may have! I would specifically like to hear if you build a muscle memory for it! :)",

The issue got escalated to an incident this morning.\n\nWell, I just got news that Google thinks the Pixel hanging/crashing apps bug is now fixed. I've asked for clarification on whether the fix is server-side or requires a Play Services update. https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1977868145840050230\n\n**Update**: Alright, got confirmation that the Pixel crashing/hanging apps fix is server-side. There will be a post-mortem within Google, but I'm not sure if it will be made public. Incidents like this one cannot happen again.

    "title": "I Switched from iPhone to Android: My Story of Losses and Gains",
    "selftext": "# Hey Reddit! I want to share my story of switching from iPhone to Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It wasn't just choosing a new phone; it was a real journey full of expectations, doubts, and unexpected discoveries.\n\n# Introduction: Seeking a New Experience\n\nI used an iPhone 13 Pro and it was almost perfect. Even when the Pixel 10 came out, I had no desire to watch the presentation. But over time, I started to feel a \"technological itch.\" I was tired of Apple's predictability and the lack of true innovation. When the 17th iPhone came out again without significant AI improvements, it was the final disappointment. On the horizon appeared the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra ‚Äî a symbol of freedom, customization, and powerful AI. This wasn't just a phone choice; it was a choice of a new philosophy. I dreamed of a world where I control my device, not the other way around.\n\n# Part I: Pros and Cons from My Experience\n\niPhone (iOS): The World I Left Behind\n\n‚Ä¢Pros (What I Miss):\n\n‚Ä¢\"Ecosystem magic\" is not a myth, but a reality. It's not just a set of features, but an invisible fabric that connects the family. I acutely felt this when I realized I could no longer see my wife's phone battery charge (a symbol of care) and disappeared from our shared fitness competition (a symbol of play and unity).\n\n‚Ä¢Flawless simplicity (\"It just works\"). AirPods connecting with animation, passwords autofilling without glitches, stable battery performance after updates. This reliability is not \"boring,\" but reassuring. It brings peace of mind, freeing my brain from having to \"fix\" basic things.\n\n‚Ä¢Predictability as an advantage. I always know what to expect. No unpleasant surprises, like a sudden battery drain or strange sleep metrics on the watch after an update. It's a world without rollercoasters.\n\n‚Ä¢Camera philosophy. The iPhone camera strives for a \"cinematic\" reality. It creates volumetric, pleasing-to-the-eye photos immediately, without the need to \"tinker\" with settings.\n\n‚Ä¢Well-designed password system. Passwords seemed like a simple app. But it's so well-designed that you don't need to remember many passwords; importantly, it generates passwords itself and works across other devices.\n\n‚Ä¢Integrated calls and messages. The ability to call other messengers from the built-in call app and a convenient built-in messaging app.\n\n‚Ä¢Health and fitness synchronization. Easy synchronization of a fitness tracker and app with the built-in health app.\n\n‚Ä¢Battery life. I'm impressed that such a small battery lasts an active day. No need to turn off Bluetooth and WiFi to save power.\n\n‚Ä¢User care. Features related to health, diary, and headphone usage monitoring.\n\n‚Ä¢Sound quality. Good sound from the speakers and the phone itself.\n\n‚Ä¢Size and dimensions. Exactly what I was looking for.\n\n‚Ä¢Face ID. A very convenient feature, especially at work where fingerprint unlock might be inconvenient.\n\n‚Ä¢Seamless Bluetooth connection. No problems connecting to Bluetooth devices.\n\n‚Ä¢Reminders. The \"Reminders\" app is very helpful for organizing thoughts and tasks.\n\n‚Ä¢Cons (Why I Left):\n\n‚Ä¢\"Golden cage.\" The feeling of being locked in. Dependence on AirDrop, iMessage, lack of flexibility. The desire to break free and try something new was incredibly strong.\n\n‚Ä¢Illusion of innovation. Annual updates brought minimal changes but cost maximum money. It felt like a waste.\n\n‚Ä¢Lack of control. I can't customize the system to my liking. I'm forced to live by Apple's rules. This is annoying when I know there could be something better and more convenient for me.\n\n‚Ä¢Notification limitations. Inability to change notification sounds in Instagram and Viber.\n\n‚Ä¢Browser limitations. On iPhone, you can't choose which browser to open news from the Google News app, which leads to a lot of ads.\n\nSamsung (Android/One UI): The World I Chose\n\n‚Ä¢Pros (What I'm Fighting For):\n\n‚Ä¢True freedom and customization. The ability to customize everything ‚Äî from the desktop to system functions via Good Lock. It's the feeling that you are the master of your device. It's my own home where I choose the wall color.\n\n‚Ä¢Powerful, ahead-of-its-time innovations. Galaxy AI, enhanced camera capabilities (after configuration), DeX. I feel like I'm using the technologies of the future today.\n\n‚Ä¢Sense of uniqueness. I'm not \"one of the crowd.\" My choice is conscious and differs from the mainstream. This brings a certain intellectual satisfaction.\n\n‚Ä¢Small things that make life easier. A more convenient messenger, a better keyboard, no \"crutches\" for basic things (like listening to music from the browser).\n\n‚Ä¢System openness. The ability to install modded YouTube and YouTube Music apps, which works great.\n\n‚Ä¢Circle to Search. The on-screen search function works great.\n\n‚Ä¢Watch integration. Notifications from my device work on my watch, which was an important factor.\n\n‚Ä¢Step transfer. Steps from the phone are transferred to the watch, allowing me to see full activity statistics.\n\n‚Ä¢Browser control. The ability to uncheck \"open in built-in browser\" for news, which helps avoid ads.\n\n‚Ä¢Cons (The Harsh Truth):\n\n‚Ä¢Freedom requires work. Customization is not only joy but also a necessity. Sometimes this necessity turns into \"repair.\" When I have to fix basic functions (battery, sleep tracking) after an update, it's no longer \"customization\" but fixing manufacturer errors.\n\n‚Ä¢Fragility of innovations. The latest features can be \"raw\" and break. This undermines trust. I expect stability from a flagship but get beta testing for my own money.\n\n‚Ä¢Emotional isolation. The most significant drawback. I fall out of familiar family \"digital rituals.\" This creates a feeling of loneliness and makes me wonder if technological freedom is worth this emotional price.\n\n‚Ä¢Camera quality. Photos come out \"flat,\" without the depth or volume that iPhone has. Videos are also not top-notch. I want the phone to do this for me, not force me to \"play with photos.\" iPhone handles this, even the 13 Pro.\n\n‚Ä¢UI appearance. The iPhone's lock screen looks better.\n\n‚Ä¢Reminders and calendar. Reminder events don't appear in the calendar by default, and while there are workarounds, it feels like a \"crutch.\"\n\n‚Ä¢Weather app. The iPhone's weather app is more detailed; Samsung just redirects to a web page.\n\n‚Ä¢Passwords. The built-in password app doesn't always work on time or connect to save new passwords. I had to install Bitwarden.\n\n‚Ä¢Watch. Although notifications work, auto-tracking for cycling didn't start, and heart rate shows incorrectly during elliptical workouts.\n\n# Part II: The Main Conclusion I Reached\n\nI realized that my choice wasn't between two phones. It was a choice between two life priorities: personal technological freedom and seamless family integration.\n\nI left iPhone because I valued the first. I started to miss it because I underestimated the importance of the second.\n\nThe problem isn't that Samsung is bad and iPhone is good. The problem is that an ideal world where there is both absolute freedom and absolute integration with family on another platform does not exist. And each of us is forced to choose which of these two values is more important to us at a given moment in life.\n\nMy struggle is not an attempt to prove that Samsung is better. It's an attempt to find a way to \"build bridges\" between my new free world and the cozy \"digital home\" where my family remained. And I don't know yet if I will succeed.\n\nMy choice of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was wise, economically justified, and aligns with my desire for innovation and freedom. The only thing I need to do is give myself permission to fully transition to Samsung. Stop comparing and start enjoying my new device. True perfectionism is not demanding an ideal, but achieving maximum comfort with minimal expenditure of resources (time, money, nerves). That's exactly what I did.",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android üëã,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to¬†**WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is¬†**SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Recently, I was searching for flip phone reviews and saw an article on the Vertu website. The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

    "selftext": "I've never owned a galaxy S8 (used apple, oneplus, pixel, then my first samsung was my current s24 ultra), but I feel like it's the most influential Android phone in the last 10 years in terms of physical design. It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

    "selftext": "Compared to traditional Linux distros, Android is very restricted, the newer versions even more so, it is very hard to root too. So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

I'm only getting around 3.5 hours of Screen-on-Time (SoT) from a 96-100% charge, with just standard, non-gaming use. It's completely unacceptable.\nI'm seriously considering selling the S25 and moving to either the Pixel 10 (base model) or the Pixel 10 Pro.\nMy main concern is that all the online reviews are contradictory. Some praise the battery, while others (especially for the base P10) seem disappointed.\nTo all Pixel 10 and 10 Pro owners:\nCould you please share your real-world, honest experiences?\nWhat kind of Screen-on-Time (SoT) are you averaging per day?\nDoes it easily get you through a full day with your typical usage?\nWould you describe the battery life as \"good\" or \"great\"?\nMy decision to switch is almost entirely based on battery life. Would this be a definite upgrade, or am I just trading one problem for another?\nAppreciate any advice you can give!",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

    "selftext": "Hi r/GooglePixel,\n\nLike many Pixel users in here lately, I've been having GPS inaccuracy issues.  I've seen posts from users on various Pixels, and it seems like it's an unsolved issue that gets brought up often enough to warrant its own thread. We can discuss potential causes and fixes here.\n\n**Please chime in if you have GPS issues on your Pixel, which model you have, and for how long you've been experiencing them. I'd love to hear if anything fixed the issue for you, too. This shouldn't be an issue on a $1000/¬£1000+ phone.**\n\n**THE ISSUE:**\n\n\\- Erratic and poor connection when using apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Strava. \n\n\\- For example, using Waze during commuting results in missed turns, being placed on the wrong road,   and getting inaccurate speeding alerts. \n\n\\- My worst example is Waze showing \"120mph\" when sat stationary at a junction.\n\n\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING / FIXES (?):**\n\nMany of the steps shown below are taken from various reddit threads, and may or may not help you.\n\n  \n\\- Set display refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\n\\- Clear A-GPS state in GPS Test app.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on High Location Accuracy.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on location services.\n\n\\- Clear Google app cache (NOTE - will mess up other services, e.g., backup).\n\n\\- Test GPS booted into safe mode.\n\n\\- Factory reset / RMA your unit.\n\n  \n**Misc:**\n\n\\- I can vouch for the issue affecting a family member's Pixel 8a (following an update) and my own Pixel 10 Pro since purchase.\n\n\\- My 10 Pro is setup from a backup of my previous Pixel 8, yet the Pixel 8 presented no GPS issues. This suggests that in my case it isn't related to an installed app.\n\n\\- I got a replacement unit through my carrier and the exact same issue still presents.\n\n\\- From online threads, it seems like the issue commonly affects the 7 Pro and newer, and dates back *at least* a year.\n\n\\- The issue isn't affected by cases, or magnetic/Qi accessories, IME.\n\n\\- Some units seem completely unaffected. I've also verified this testing with friends' Pixel 8 Pro / 10 Pro XLs beside my own faulty unit. If you have issues and want to try this yourself, download GPS Test and compare accuracy (in metres).",

    "title": "1 Month Review of Google Pixel 10 Pro - Disappointing for the price, Don't Buy Yet",
    "selftext": "I Bought this phone for my mother who previously had a Pixel 8. She liked the phone overall and was complaining about the battery and it freezing occasionally. She doesn't use her phone for much besides content and communication, so I thought that and the fact she's already in the ecosystem, I'd by her a 10 Pro. After a month of use we're both going to return the phone and try to buy something like a s25+ or 17 pro. Here's my honest review\n\n**Pros**\n\n* *UI/Software -* Phone feels great to use, UI is responsive and visually appealing. I genuinely think it has the best UI out of any phone currently\n* *Hardware -* Feels premium in the hand, a bit heavy but overall the screen, cameras, buttons, charging, and finger print reader keep up with the other phones of the same price and what I'd expect for paying $1k+\n* *AI -* Didn't use too many of the features since it's not my phone, but when I did use it it was all really impressive. The AI photo tools are surprisingly good and useful, and Gemini is miles ahead of other phones, giving actual response (unlike Apple \"Intelligence\")\n\n**Issues**\n\n* *Battery -* For comparison, I have a 2 year old 15 pro max with 80% battery health, I have on average 2 more hours screen time than her on the pixel, and I occasionally game on the 15 pro max. We'd end the day and I'd have more battery almost always compared to her. You should still be able to get through a day of moderate use with a Pixel, but it's a bit lackluster compared to other phones right now.\n* *Freezing -* My mom would mention an app freezing every other day, and in some cases you'd even have to full restart the phone for the app to work. She uses her phone a lot for work, and when your apps keep crashing it makes the entire experience frustrating. I expect maybe in a few months some updates will fix this issue\n* *Google Apps -* Youtube has a decent amount of issues when it comes to going fullscreen, sometimes freezes. Google Maps was the biggest problem. When using it the location and direction were so inaccurate that it was literally unusable(not exaggerating). I tried debugging both, but they are updated and still have issues. You'd expect Google apps to work on a Google Phone, but they both work better on my Iphone.\n\nOverall I really like the Pixel, and was actually looking to switch my phone over after my current one breaks or gets old, but the issues are too glaring. The last straw happened today, her phone was on the lock screen, but completely frozen, the time and notifications were visible, the fingerprint reader was functional, but as soon as you open the phone you're met with a black screen. A restart fixed the issue, but at this point after a month of complaints I think it will just be best if we replace it with a different phone. I think most of the issues will be fixed eventually with updates, but also keep in mind I spent $1100. I don't see the appeal for wanting the current pixel unless you really love the AI features it has. The pixel is slower, has worse battery life, and has more bugs as compared to other phones its price. If you use your phone primarily for photos/social media and don't use game, I'd say wait a few months for them to update them, otherwise I'd avoid buying this phone. I have high hopes for Pixel, however, and hope they can fix the issues in future generations.\n\nThanks for the read, I'll try to answer any questions",

They advertise that their case works with PixelSnap and even has product photos of it using a stand, but it's false advertising and their case doesn't work at all with PixelSnap accessories.\n\nThey also have a return policy of 30 days and when I reached out, their automated emailing system said it would be 24 hours before they would get back to me and that never happened. I ended up having to reach out to PayPal to investigate before doing a charge back and guess what? I finally got a response and they are having me pay for shipping the case back with me just putting a return number in the package. There's not real official return process outside of that \n\nTLDR: The Ghostek Pixel 10 Pro Fold case is a scam and doesn't work with PixelSnap.",

That I did not have the phone was always in a protecting cover. They wanted 150‚Ç¨. I couldn't even get more info, had 2 options. Pay for the repair or send the phone back to me. \n\nOf course I chose to send it back, I have not received any more information. It's been 10 days with no info. Today I finally got hold of someone at Google and they just said the same thing again and again. They will escalate the issue. Could not tell me where the phone is, if it is sent or not, if it is lost or not. Just that they will escalate and hopefully I will be contacted via e-mail within 48h.\n\nI loved my pixel 8, almost bought the new one. Instead am typing this on my Samsung now. ",

However this is not always available to me so I have to use my phone. Never satisfying as it never works as well as I need it to. \n\nNow I've had the Swype keyboards from earliest days on my Samsung galaxy s2 though various android phones too my P9 now. It got ok but then kind of lost the plot.\n\n I've tried the Google gesture typing. I've tried typing each letter and use autocorrect but jeez how many times do I have to make sure the language is English UK and it still passes English US spelling. How hard is it to remember to use grey, colour, etc??!!\n\nThen there's the gesture types of keyboards. The first one I used you did a loop over a letter you doubled snoop, loop, etc has a squiggle over the letter o. It worked years ago on older phones but it's been going wrong on my last two or three phones.\n\nThen there's the note taking app itself. It's so difficult to put in formatting to highlight say bullet points, underlining or highlighting. I've used basic notes through to onenote, and those competitors like evernote, keep, etc.\n\nSo my question is twofold, what is the best way to put notes down into the memory of your phone via an input method? Secondly, what is a really good and efficient note taking app that allows efficient ways to put thoughts or notes down with formatting to emphasis points as needed? \n\nThe first I am limited by not wanting voice input method. The second is limited by not wanting to spend that much on it. Also, little notebook isn't helpful for me as I want to not carry such things on the off chance I'm going to need it when there's a phone with me all the time. It's a phone based option I need \n\nI hope people have ideas to help me here ",

Presenting this transcript made no difference. Google refused to do absolutely anything to defuse this situation. \nIn the end I decided to return the tablet. That way Google is paying for shipping and refurbishing this tablet. I could care less at this point. \nSilver lining is that I got Galaxy Tab 10 lite instead and couldn't be happier.

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device‚Äôs screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A ‚Ç¨500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn‚Äôt I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google‚Äôs assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can‚Äôt even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen‚Äôs problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle‚Äôs written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don‚Äôt know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I‚Äôve been for months without my phone, and it‚Äôll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google‚Äôs abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this! Best wishes. üôÇ",

Not having much luck troubleshooting online, so if anyone has suggestions for either of these, help would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n1. No longer autocompleting Google searches. The phone asked if I wanted to sync information across devices, which I thought I'd done on my last one, so I said yes. Since agreeing to that, I no longer get autocomplete/suggested searches for Google searches (on my phone or on my laptop). When I start typing a question, all that comes up is my own previous queries. I do have the Trending Search setting turned on. I also tried turning on the personalized autocomplete setting, but all that did was start including websites I have saved to my bookmarks. I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, and restarting the phone, but nothing helps \n\n2. Discover won't go away. I've ensured the discover setting is off, but I still get an MSN-style list of news stories every time I open a new tab or spend time away from a tab (I come back to it, and the content is minimized with an option to pick back up where I left off... with an MSN-style list of stories beneath it). This one is still working correctly on my laptop (no stories shown to me there), but it's making me a bit nuts that it won't go away on the Pixel. Again here, I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, restarting the phone, to no avail.\n\nThanks again for any tips!",

Although the Chip and the battery aren't the best on a or specifically this foldable, I always wanted one and went all in. I love everything about it and even the noticeable grace of this foldable is rather pleasant to me, I wanted a foldable, I got one, and it only reminds me of the fact that it's foldable.\n\nNow to the rent part of this post, the camera. I'm not a camera guy at all. The years before I didn't even transport or safe my pictures before changing the phone so I lost them every time. It was nothing memorable, just pictures of things to remind me of or something.\nBut with pixel, as it was considered the best phone camera for a long time, I thought, I'd look into it. It looks well done as everything does, but why can't I have the option to just shoot raw in the full, advertised 48mp?\n\nEvery other pixel phone has the option as far as I know and even Gemini told me that it's there, even after the proof of multiple screenshots. It just sounds like a no brainer to just not included the option because, why not.\nI read things online about pixel binging and all the different stuff, but after all, let the people decide what they want after they paid about 1800‚Ç¨ for a brand new phone with the camera of lasts gen, which, btw. had the option to select 48mp raw.\nI won't really need it, it just noticed it and got pissed off, because when I shoot pictures, I also want raw in full quality!\n\nWhy Google, just why?

The past two years I switched to the Apple echosystem.. I actually really liked it because it brought me back to the basics and it managed to handle basic task very very very good. Build quality felt amazing and the camera's were amazing. Because of some compatibilty issues with work I had to switch to Android. Again, choosing the Samsung over every other phone because of the looks and performance (on paper). \n\nI realised that the Apple Echosystem is very restrictive so I don't think I will ever switch back to Apple again.\n\nSo here I am... looking into a Pixel because it really gives me Apple vibes, as if Samsung and the iPhone had a baby.\n\nSo, I have a few questions before I consider taking the Pixel (I think I will wait for the Pixel 11):\n\n1. How is the camera? I really like taking Portrait pictures with my phone.  \n2. I had a few moments with the Pixel in a phone store but I couldn't get all out. But it looked to me like as if the widgets were very limited. I normally use the weather widget and the google agenda widget on my homescreen, the google agenda widget on the Samsung shows the full month with the daily tasks on the screen. It didnt look like Pixel has the same widget option. Does anyone know wether this is customizable?  \n3. How is gaming on the Pixel? I sometimes like to play games like Genshin Impact or Wuthering Waves\n\nThank you all",

    "selftext": "Purchased a Pixel 9 about a month ago while on vacation in another country because my previous phone gave out. I noticed that there is a noticeable gap between the screen and the frame (enough to slot a piece of paper in), mostly uniform but slightly more pronounced at the bottom. The screen is also ever so slightly raised up from frame level.\n\nI didn't request for the device to be replaced because I was due to leave for the country I live in in just a few days, also because there was conflicting information online on whether this was normal or not.\n\nI also recently noticed that sometimes there's this faint cluster of pixels flashing green just under the selfie camera cutout (happens only on lower brightness settings), although I'm not sure if it's a hardware issue because I haven't seen it before, and I would definitely have noticed it before if it happened. I don't think it's dead/stuck pixels either because I don't see this happening when I view solid colours on the screen. Also since this phone has a Samsung display and not a BOE one, so the chances are lower. It's usually intermittent but it has stopped happening for now.\n\nI also understand that the gap probably won't void the water resistance because it's not the size of the gap that protects the device, rather the glue under the screen that attaches the display to the frame.\n\nAnyway, I contacted Google support today, and the support agent was more than willing to start an RMA when I asked for it, and said they'd send a brand new replacement. They also said they'd reject the RMA if they found physical damage on my current device.\n\nNow I'm just confused if it's worth attempting an RMA because the phone seems to be working fine and the gap probably doesn't affect water resistance. Besides, there's a couple hairline scratches on the screen, hard to find, but they're there. \n\nI'm afraid the RMA might get rejected because of this and apparently the whole process may take 5-10 business days. Don't want to have to factory reset my phone and wait so long only for it to get rejected.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Does anyone here have experience RMA-ing Pixels in Germany?\n\nPictures of how the gap looks: https://imgur.com/a/GUKiaK1 (zoom in for a better look)",

And what's the point of doing it on an unlocked phone if you can use an unlocked phone on any network? \n\nThe only reason I can think of is if some carrier rolled out Android xx earlier than another one so you can access it sooner by a few days or weeks but that seems not worth the risk of bricking your phone. \n\nCan cross flashing get rid of network restrictions? Or do you need to swap logic boards for that? ",

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device‚Äôs screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A ‚Ç¨500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn‚Äôt I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google‚Äôs assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can‚Äôt even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen‚Äôs problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle‚Äôs written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don‚Äôt know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I‚Äôve been for months without my phone, and it‚Äôll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google‚Äôs abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this! Best wishes. üôÇ",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

I'm only getting around 3.5 hours of Screen-on-Time (SoT) from a 96-100% charge, with just standard, non-gaming use. It's completely unacceptable.\nI'm seriously considering selling the S25 and moving to either the Pixel 10 (base model) or the Pixel 10 Pro.\nMy main concern is that all the online reviews are contradictory. Some praise the battery, while others (especially for the base P10) seem disappointed.\nTo all Pixel 10 and 10 Pro owners:\nCould you please share your real-world, honest experiences?\nWhat kind of Screen-on-Time (SoT) are you averaging per day?\nDoes it easily get you through a full day with your typical usage?\nWould you describe the battery life as \"good\" or \"great\"?\nMy decision to switch is almost entirely based on battery life. Would this be a definite upgrade, or am I just trading one problem for another?\nAppreciate any advice you can give!",

That I did not have the phone was always in a protecting cover. They wanted 150‚Ç¨. I couldn't even get more info, had 2 options. Pay for the repair or send the phone back to me. \n\nOf course I chose to send it back, I have not received any more information. It's been 10 days with no info. Today I finally got hold of someone at Google and they just said the same thing again and again. They will escalate the issue. Could not tell me where the phone is, if it is sent or not, if it is lost or not.

I've seen posts from users on various Pixels, and it seems like it's an unsolved issue that gets brought up often enough to warrant its own thread. We can discuss potential causes and fixes here.\n\n**Please chime in if you have GPS issues on your Pixel, which model you have, and for how long you've been experiencing them. I'd love to hear if anything fixed the issue for you, too. This shouldn't be an issue on a $1000/¬£1000+ phone.**\n\n**THE ISSUE:**\n\n\\- Erratic and poor connection when using apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Strava. \n\n\\- For example, using Waze during commuting results in missed turns, being placed on the wrong road,   and getting inaccurate speeding alerts. \n\n\\- My worst example is Waze showing \"120mph\" when sat stationary at a junction.\n\n\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING / FIXES (?):**\n\nMany of the steps shown below are taken from various reddit threads, and may or may not help you.\n\n  \n\\- Set display refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\n\\- Clear A-GPS state in GPS Test app.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on High Location Accuracy.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on location services.\n\n\\- Clear Google app cache (NOTE - will mess up other services, e.g., backup).\n\n\\- Test GPS booted into safe mode.\n\n\\- Factory reset / RMA your unit.\n\n  \n**Misc:**\n\n\\- I can vouch for the issue affecting a family member's Pixel 8a (following an update) and my own Pixel 10 Pro since purchase.\n\n\\- My 10 Pro is setup from a backup of my previous Pixel 8, yet the Pixel 8 presented no GPS issues. This suggests that in my case it isn't related to an installed app.\n\n\\- I got a replacement unit through my carrier and the exact same issue still presents.\n\n\\- From online threads, it seems like the issue commonly affects the 7 Pro and newer, and dates back *at least* a year.\n\n\\- The issue isn't affected by cases, or magnetic/Qi accessories, IME.\n\n\\- Some units seem completely unaffected. I've also verified this testing with friends' Pixel 8 Pro / 10 Pro XLs beside my own faulty unit. If you have issues and want to try this yourself, download GPS Test and compare accuracy (in metres).",

    "title": "1 Month Review of Google Pixel 10 Pro - Disappointing for the price, Don't Buy Yet",
    "selftext": "I Bought this phone for my mother who previously had a Pixel 8. She liked the phone overall and was complaining about the battery and it freezing occasionally. She doesn't use her phone for much besides content and communication, so I thought that and the fact she's already in the ecosystem, I'd by her a 10 Pro. After a month of use we're both going to return the phone and try to buy something like a s25+ or 17 pro. Here's my honest review\n\n**Pros**\n\n* *UI/Software -* Phone feels great to use, UI is responsive and visually appealing. I genuinely think it has the best UI out of any phone currently\n* *Hardware -* Feels premium in the hand, a bit heavy but overall the screen, cameras, buttons, charging, and finger print reader keep up with the other phones of the same price and what I'd expect for paying $1k+\n* *AI -* Didn't use too many of the features since it's not my phone, but when I did use it it was all really impressive. The AI photo tools are surprisingly good and useful, and Gemini is miles ahead of other phones, giving actual response (unlike Apple \"Intelligence\")\n\n**Issues**\n\n* *Battery -* For comparison, I have a 2 year old 15 pro max with 80% battery health, I have on average 2 more hours screen time than her on the pixel, and I occasionally game on the 15 pro max. We'd end the day and I'd have more battery almost always compared to her. You should still be able to get through a day of moderate use with a Pixel, but it's a bit lackluster compared to other phones right now.\n* *Freezing -* My mom would mention an app freezing every other day, and in some cases you'd even have to full restart the phone for the app to work. She uses her phone a lot for work, and when your apps keep crashing it makes the entire experience frustrating. I expect maybe in a few months some updates will fix this issue\n* *Google Apps -* Youtube has a decent amount of issues when it comes to going fullscreen, sometimes freezes. Google Maps was the biggest problem. When using it the location and direction were so inaccurate that it was literally unusable(not exaggerating). I tried debugging both, but they are updated and still have issues. You'd expect Google apps to work on a Google Phone, but they both work better on my Iphone.\n\nOverall I really like the Pixel, and was actually looking to switch my phone over after my current one breaks or gets old, but the issues are too glaring. The last straw happened today, her phone was on the lock screen, but completely frozen, the time and notifications were visible, the fingerprint reader was functional, but as soon as you open the phone you're met with a black screen. A restart fixed the issue, but at this point after a month of complaints I think it will just be best if we replace it with a different phone. I think most of the issues will be fixed eventually with updates, but also keep in mind I spent $1100. I don't see the appeal for wanting the current pixel unless you really love the AI features it has. The pixel is slower, has worse battery life, and has more bugs as compared to other phones its price. If you use your phone primarily for photos/social media and don't use game, I'd say wait a few months for them to update them, otherwise I'd avoid buying this phone. I have high hopes for Pixel, however, and hope they can fix the issues in future generations.\n\nThanks for the read, I'll try to answer any questions",

I ended up having to reach out to PayPal to investigate before doing a charge back and guess what?

    "selftext": "Confession, I like analogue paper and pen or pencil. I find the kinesthetic aspect of handwriting helps me remember things or work things through. However this is not always available to me so I have to use my phone. Never satisfying as it never works as well as I need it to. \n\nNow I've had the Swype keyboards from earliest days on my Samsung galaxy s2 though various android phones too my P9 now. It got ok but then kind of lost the plot.\n\n I've tried the Google gesture typing. I've tried typing each letter and use autocorrect but jeez how many times do I have to make sure the language is English UK and it still passes English US spelling. How hard is it to remember to use grey, colour, etc??!!\n\nThen there's the gesture types of keyboards. The first one I used you did a loop over a letter you doubled snoop, loop, etc has a squiggle over the letter o. It worked years ago on older phones but it's been going wrong on my last two or three phones.\n\nThen there's the note taking app itself. It's so difficult to put in formatting to highlight say bullet points, underlining or highlighting. I've used basic notes through to onenote, and those competitors like evernote, keep, etc.\n\nSo my question is twofold, what is the best way to put notes down into the memory of your phone via an input method? Secondly, what is a really good and efficient note taking app that allows efficient ways to put thoughts or notes down with formatting to emphasis points as needed? \n\nThe first I am limited by not wanting voice input method. The second is limited by not wanting to spend that much on it. Also, little notebook isn't helpful for me as I want to not carry such things on the off chance I'm going to need it when there's a phone with me all the time. It's a phone based option I need \n\nI hope people have ideas to help me here ",

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device‚Äôs screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A ‚Ç¨500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn‚Äôt I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google‚Äôs assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can‚Äôt even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen‚Äôs problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle‚Äôs written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don‚Äôt know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I‚Äôve been for months without my phone, and it‚Äôll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google‚Äôs abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this!

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of.

    "selftext": "Hey Pixel community,\nI'm currently on a Samsung S25 and I'm incredibly frustrated with the battery life. I'm only getting around 3.5 hours of Screen-on-Time (SoT) from a 96-100% charge, with just standard, non-gaming use. It's completely unacceptable.\nI'm seriously considering selling the S25 and moving to either the Pixel 10 (base model) or the Pixel 10 Pro.\nMy main concern is that all the online reviews are contradictory. Some praise the battery, while others (especially for the base P10) seem disappointed.\nTo all Pixel 10 and 10 Pro owners:\nCould you please share your real-world, honest experiences?\nWhat kind of Screen-on-Time (SoT) are you averaging per day?\nDoes it easily get you through a full day with your typical usage?\nWould you describe the battery life as \"good\" or \"great\"?\nMy decision to switch is almost entirely based on battery life. Would this be a definite upgrade, or am I just trading one problem for another?\nAppreciate any advice you can give!",

That I did not have the phone was always in a protecting cover. They wanted 150‚Ç¨. I couldn't even get more info, had 2 options.

Today I finally got hold of someone at Google and they just said the same thing again and again. They will escalate the issue. Could not tell me where the phone is, if it is sent or not, if it is lost or not.

    "selftext": "Hi r/GooglePixel,\n\nLike many Pixel users in here lately, I've been having GPS inaccuracy issues.  I've seen posts from users on various Pixels, and it seems like it's an unsolved issue that gets brought up often enough to warrant its own thread. We can discuss potential causes and fixes here.\n\n**Please chime in if you have GPS issues on your Pixel, which model you have, and for how long you've been experiencing them. I'd love to hear if anything fixed the issue for you, too. This shouldn't be an issue on a $1000/¬£1000+ phone.**\n\n**THE ISSUE:**\n\n\\- Erratic and poor connection when using apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Strava. \n\n\\- For example, using Waze during commuting results in missed turns, being placed on the wrong road,   and getting inaccurate speeding alerts. \n\n\\- My worst example is Waze showing \"120mph\" when sat stationary at a junction.\n\n\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING / FIXES (?):**\n\nMany of the steps shown below are taken from various reddit threads, and may or may not help you.\n\n  \n\\- Set display refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\n\\- Clear A-GPS state in GPS Test app.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on High Location Accuracy.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on location services.\n\n\\- Clear Google app cache (NOTE - will mess up other services, e.g., backup).\n\n\\- Test GPS booted into safe mode.\n\n\\- Factory reset / RMA your unit.\n\n  \n**Misc:**\n\n\\- I can vouch for the issue affecting a family member's Pixel 8a (following an update) and my own Pixel 10 Pro since purchase.\n\n\\- My 10 Pro is setup from a backup of my previous Pixel 8, yet the Pixel 8 presented no GPS issues. This suggests that in my case it isn't related to an installed app.\n\n\\- I got a replacement unit through my carrier and the exact same issue still presents.\n\n\\- From online threads, it seems like the issue commonly affects the 7 Pro and newer, and dates back *at least* a year.\n\n\\- The issue isn't affected by cases, or magnetic/Qi accessories, IME.\n\n\\- Some units seem completely unaffected. I've also verified this testing with friends' Pixel 8 Pro / 10 Pro XLs beside my own faulty unit. If you have issues and want to try this yourself, download GPS Test and compare accuracy (in metres).",

    "title": "1 Month Review of Google Pixel 10 Pro - Disappointing for the price, Don't Buy Yet",
    "selftext": "I Bought this phone for my mother who previously had a Pixel 8. She liked the phone overall and was complaining about the battery and it freezing occasionally. She doesn't use her phone for much besides content and communication, so I thought that and the fact she's already in the ecosystem, I'd by her a 10 Pro. After a month of use we're both going to return the phone and try to buy something like a s25+ or 17 pro. Here's my honest review\n\n**Pros**\n\n* *UI/Software -* Phone feels great to use, UI is responsive and visually appealing. I genuinely think it has the best UI out of any phone currently\n* *Hardware -* Feels premium in the hand, a bit heavy but overall the screen, cameras, buttons, charging, and finger print reader keep up with the other phones of the same price and what I'd expect for paying $1k+\n* *AI -* Didn't use too many of the features since it's not my phone, but when I did use it it was all really impressive. The AI photo tools are surprisingly good and useful, and Gemini is miles ahead of other phones, giving actual response (unlike Apple \"Intelligence\")\n\n**Issues**\n\n* *Battery -* For comparison, I have a 2 year old 15 pro max with 80% battery health, I have on average 2 more hours screen time than her on the pixel, and I occasionally game on the 15 pro max. We'd end the day and I'd have more battery almost always compared to her. You should still be able to get through a day of moderate use with a Pixel, but it's a bit lackluster compared to other phones right now.\n* *Freezing -* My mom would mention an app freezing every other day, and in some cases you'd even have to full restart the phone for the app to work. She uses her phone a lot for work, and when your apps keep crashing it makes the entire experience frustrating. I expect maybe in a few months some updates will fix this issue\n* *Google Apps -* Youtube has a decent amount of issues when it comes to going fullscreen, sometimes freezes. Google Maps was the biggest problem. When using it the location and direction were so inaccurate that it was literally unusable(not exaggerating). I tried debugging both, but they are updated and still have issues. You'd expect Google apps to work on a Google Phone, but they both work better on my Iphone.\n\nOverall I really like the Pixel, and was actually looking to switch my phone over after my current one breaks or gets old, but the issues are too glaring. The last straw happened today, her phone was on the lock screen, but completely frozen, the time and notifications were visible, the fingerprint reader was functional, but as soon as you open the phone you're met with a black screen. A restart fixed the issue, but at this point after a month of complaints I think it will just be best if we replace it with a different phone. I think most of the issues will be fixed eventually with updates, but also keep in mind I spent $1100. I don't see the appeal for wanting the current pixel unless you really love the AI features it has. The pixel is slower, has worse battery life, and has more bugs as compared to other phones its price. If you use your phone primarily for photos/social media and don't use game, I'd say wait a few months for them to update them, otherwise I'd avoid buying this phone. I have high hopes for Pixel, however, and hope they can fix the issues in future generations.\n\nThanks for the read, I'll try to answer any questions",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I‚Äôm there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this sound bar isn‚Äôt quite on the same level as my old system was, but it‚Äôs probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I‚Äôve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

And i was telling him why Samasung is better and how AI is light years ahead than Apple.\n\nSo we took a picture in his phone of his bike which was in front of us and his phone caught fast moving objects clearly in the background. Btw the objective was to see which Magic Eraser works better. Although Samsungs eraser was sooo much better... but on a different picture. Because my camera couldn't capture one vehicle in the background clearly.\n\nI do have Quick Tap Shutter on and Prioritize Focus over speed off. I thought Samsung could do better because it's pretty much iPhone 15 or 16 equivalent. Idk I thought camera was kinda close to iPhone but phone camers, i think iPhone wins hands down.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "I recently bought a new Xiaomi 17 Pro Max (without any options, it's a China ROM) and I am the owner of a global version Galaxy Watch 6. The question arose of how to connect them to the phone, since the standard connection via the Galaxy Wearable app from the Google Play Market didn't work. I kept getting an error that the connection failed or that the phone was not supported. So, for people like me, I'm writing this guide, since I managed to do it, and I haven't found another guide like this on the internet. (At any stage, you may encounter difficulties with permission to install applications, but I hope you can handle this yourself <3 )  \n1. This is probably optional, I haven't tested without this step: Resets the watch settings;  \n2. You need to download the Tencent App Store;  \n3. Next, download the following applications from the Tencent App Store: Galaxy Wearable and Wear OS by Google;  \n4. Download the required version of the galaxy plugin from the Play Market: for me it was Galaxy Watch6 plugin.  \n5. Go to the settings of all 3 applications and set them to autostart in the battery settings \"No restrictions\", and in the permissions settings you can give all access. I don‚Äôt remember exactly, but \"Acess list of installed apps\" and \"Open new window shile running in the background\" it was enough if someone doesn‚Äôt want to give everything;  \n6. Go to Bluetooth settings and connect the watch;  \n7. In Wear OS, you should see two buttons. One for Wear OS watch, And the second one with text \"Have a Samsung watch?\" with a button \"Open Galaxy Wearable\" <- you need this button. Galaxy Wearable should open and show your Bluetooth connected watch. Start connecting.  \n8. **SKIP ALL THE STEPS OF LOGGING INTO YOUR SAMSUNG AND GOOGLE ACCOUNTS!!**! You can do it later.  \nP.S. Sometimes, during the setup process, everything might break at some percentage. Don't panic, and try again. I usually get it right on the second try.",

    "selftext": "Hello redditors!\n\nI have previously asked in this community if it's worth purchasing the Galaxy Watch 4 LTE 44mm refurbished for around 80$, and most people said I should I go search for an another model at around the same price. So while looking today, I found a lot of Galaxy Watch 7 40mm LTE listings for around 100$ - 120$. My question is if it's worth getting it for that price? One seller even said it's almost brand new, and it's been used for only 5 days, another said it's been rarely used. And for the price tag, plus the LTE feature, and being a relatively new flagship model (last year is was a flagship watch), I think it's worth to go for it. What do you guys think? Or should I get it, or should I go for Watch 6, 5, or an older model?\n\nMy question is if it's worth getting the Watch 7 LTE 40mm for this price tag? Is the battery relatively good, especially with LTE ON? Or does the Galaxy Watch 4 44mm or other older watches perform better? What about the experience, is it lag-free, what sensors does it have compared to older models, and why should I get it over an older model? And will it be any difference if using it with a Galaxy phone or not? And, jumping from a Galaxy Fit 3 to this watch would be a major difference? And if anything, how much does a battery swap cost?\n\nThanks in advance for helping me out!\n\n  \nEDIT 1: I forgot to mention, does this watch have comfortable straps and a comfortable design compared to older models?",

Sure enough, I call again, some support person tells me that I will be contacted within 24 - 72 hours by someone to discuss my options. Long story short, i receive an email today, pretty vague, saying that the watch is not repairable, so they will refund my purchase. I have a Fit 3, but i really got used to all the premium features of the Ultra and the relatively decent battery life. A new 2025 Ultra is almost $700 with tax. I have no idea what was wrong with my watch and now I'm terrified that it might happen again.\n\n  \nUpdate: Samsung has reached out to me and they will be providing me with a coupon that should cover cost of a new Ultra watch 2025. It's going to take a few days though.",

The other 2 moderators have been inactive for a few months, so I‚Äôve taken over the role as top moderator for the community. I‚Äôve been doing some spring cleaning and updates, with the biggest changes being:\n\n\n\n* The rules list is much clearer and more detailed\n* The rule on Watch Face Posts is now:\n   * Pictures of real watches are allowed, but advertisements are not.\n   * See the included image as an example\n\n\n\nSome other smaller changes:\n\n\n\n* More ‚ÄúSimilar Communities‚Äù subreddits are on the sidebar\n* Flairs have been cleaned up slightly and might be combined in the future.\n* The backlog of unprocessed rule violation reports has been actioned and cleared\n   * If your post or comment was accidentally removed, let me know!\n* A comment sticky has been created clarifying the new Watch Face Post rule\n\n\n\nWe will be doing a call for moderators in the future. Stay tuned!\n\n\n\nDo you have any feedback or requests you‚Äôd like to share about the state of the subreddit? Please let me know!\n\n",

Had mixed reviews so at last had to come to reddit. \nConsidering the 8 classic, silver watch with blue hybrid band. Similar setup but love some features of the 8 classic especially rotating bezel. Tried it hands on and found it less bulkier but the ultra 2025 feels lighter.\nAny suggestions advise will be appreciated. ",

    "title": "Pairing galaxy watch with xiaomi China rom",
    "selftext": "I recently bought a new Xiaomi 17 Pro Max (without any options, it's a China ROM) and I am the owner of a global version Galaxy Watch 6. The question arose of how to connect them to the phone, since the standard connection via the Galaxy Wearable app from the Google Play Market didn't work. I kept getting an error that the connection failed or that the phone was not supported. So, for people like me, I'm writing this guide, since I managed to do it, and I haven't found another guide like this on the internet. (At any stage, you may encounter difficulties with permission to install applications, but I hope you can handle this yourself <3 )  \n1. This is probably optional, I haven't tested without this step: Resets the watch settings;  \n2. You need to download the Tencent App Store;  \n3. Next, download the following applications from the Tencent App Store: Galaxy Wearable and Wear OS by Google;  \n4. Download the required version of the galaxy plugin from the Play Market: for me it was Galaxy Watch6 plugin.  \n5. Go to the settings of all 3 applications and set them to autostart in the battery settings \"No restrictions\", and in the permissions settings you can give all access. I don‚Äôt remember exactly, but \"Acess list of installed apps\" and \"Open new window shile running in the background\" it was enough if someone doesn‚Äôt want to give everything;  \n6. Go to Bluetooth settings and connect the watch;  \n7. In Wear OS, you should see two buttons. One for Wear OS watch, And the second one with text \"Have a Samsung watch?\" with a button \"Open Galaxy Wearable\" <- you need this button. Galaxy Wearable should open and show your Bluetooth connected watch. Start connecting.  \n8. **SKIP ALL THE STEPS OF LOGGING INTO YOUR SAMSUNG AND GOOGLE ACCOUNTS!!**! You can do it later.  \nP.S. Sometimes, during the setup process, everything might break at some percentage. Don't panic, and try again. I usually get it right on the second try.",

I've been looking at these models https://www.hp.com/gb-en/shop/list.aspx?fc_scrn_14=1&fc_sb_omnibook7=1&sel=ntb  and wanted to know if most importantly they are well built to last some years (I would use it no more than 2-3 hours a day tops, for regular browsing, watching movies as well as some gog games, nothin modern) I don't mind spending some more if it's worth in the long run.\nI'm open to other recommendations for those needs.\nI'm know I could get away with an older model but I wanted to get something more modern for future proof.\nThanks a lot",

Here‚Äôs the full story in chronological order.\n\nüïê 2019 ‚Äì Early 2020\n\nLaptop worked great for the first ~6 months.\n\nHeavy gaming (Apex Legends, etc.) pushed GPU temps to 80‚Äì85 ¬∞C.\n\nThe display would suddenly go black, sound would freeze, and I had to force shutdown.\n\nAfter cooling down, it would boot normally again.\n\nLag when plugged in: Occasionally, since purchase, performance would drop badly until I unplugged and re-plugged the charger, then FPS would instantly recover.\n\nüßπ Mid 2020 ‚Äì 2021\n\nFound dust clogging the cooling system; cleaned it thoroughly.\n\nTemps improved and random shutdowns reduced.\n\nAround 2021, HP UEFI Diagnostics flagged a ‚ÄúVideo Memory [F] failure‚Äù ‚Üí confirmed early VRAM instability on the GPU.\n\nFrom this point onward, the GPU remained functional but unstable under high load.\n\n‚ö° 2022 ‚Äì 2024\n\nContinued gaming on medium settings; GPU stayed below 78 ¬∞C.\n\nOccasional driver crashes or screen flickers.\n\nNo major shutdowns, but instability kept creeping back.\n\nüîã 2025\n\nHP Smart reported a ‚Äúblown charge-state fuse‚Äù ‚Äî battery stopped charging completely. Removed the battery since this. I get CMOS error and I press enter to see boot (hp omen logo).\n\nBegan using the laptop plugged in only, like a desktop.\n\nThe power button started blinking continuously even during normal operation ‚Üí likely due to the battery-circuit fault.\n\nSystem still booted and worked fine on AC.\n\nüí• Current State (2025 October)\n\nThe internal laptop display stays black most of the time (backlight faintly glows).\n\nExternal 200 Hz monitor (HDMI) works well ‚Äî I can even play Apex Legends for hours on medium settings with GPU VRAM capped to 4 GB.\n\n\nNVIDIA Control Panel won‚Äôt open, though the RTX 2070 is visible in Device Manager and Task Manager.\n\nBoot behavior:\n\nExternal monitor connected via HDMI.\n\nPress power ‚Üí CMOS error occurs(sometimes it wont be displayed in either of the displays, occurs when I start the laptop after a long time, like half a day etc) (I press enter to proceed with booting, as one can see if windows is booted or not by pressing caps lock to see if the button lights are working or not) \n\nWhat happens next in a successful boot is, the powee button light goes off and turns on in like 2 sec, I press entee agan and the same cycle happens for one more time (2 to 3 timez at max), and then the external display connected (sometimes internal display too) gets hp omen logo boot screen. Post this, if windows login acreen comes, in atleast one of the displays, it is a successful boot. Else, I have to force shutdown the pc and start again\n\nSystem reboots itself once or twice.\n\nHP Omen logo appears ‚Äî almost always on the external monitor.\n\nDisplay outcomes (approx. 10 boots):\n\n5 times ‚Üí only external monitor shows the Windows login screen, laptop panel stays blank.\n\n1 time ‚Üí both monitors work correctly and internal 144 Hz panel shows Windows login.\n\n4 times ‚Üí internal panel = black, external = HP logo only (no Windows output). I can still log in blindly and shut down via Alt + F4, so the system is running headless.\n\nWhen I try to ‚ÄúDuplicate display,‚Äù both displays drop to 1024√ó768 @ 60 Hz, the only modes Windows detects for the laptop screen.\n\nüîé Current Symptoms Summary\n\nGPU and HDMI output work reliably; internal panel almost dead.\n\nCMOS error on every cold boot ‚Üí BIOS resets device detection.\n\nHP Diagnostics previously confirmed Video Memory failure.\n\nüí≠ My Suspicions\n\nPartial GPU VRAM degradation or faulty eDP (output to internal panel).\n\nPossible loose or damaged eDP cable/panel connector.\n\nWeak CMOS battery causing repeated re-detection and boot loops.\n\nBattery-charging fuse blown (confirmed), forcing AC-only operation.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è What Still Works\n\nExternal monitor gaming at 200 Hz for hours.\n\nAll USB, audio, and Ethernet functions.\n\nInternal panel sometimes returns to life for one boot, then fails again.\n\n‚ùìLooking for Advice\n\nHas anyone seen an RTX-series GPU that works fine externally but fails internally?\n\nCould a failing VRAM or eDP transmitter cause intermittent CMOS errors?\n\nIs a GPU reball worth it on this board (L50873-006), or should I hunt for a replacement motherboard?\n\nAny way to disable the internal panel entirely to speed up boot?\n\nAny insights or similar experiences would really help.\nThanks for reading ‚Äî posting this so future Omen owners facing half-dead GPUs can find a full timeline too.",

I have an Android phone.\n* I store my files on both Google Drive and OneDrive (and don't really store things locally, but I use the sync apps).\n\nI'm drawn to the MacBook Air due to it's battery life and reliability. But I'm drawn to the Surface due to it's familiarity and customisability. There are a few Windows features I use regularly, and I don't know if I could give them up:\n\n* Ability to copy and paste file paths in Explorer.\n* Snipping Tool.\n* The task bar (each window having it's own icon, being able to hover over the icons and see previews).\n* Easily snapping windows on the screen using keyboard shortcuts.\n* Centre clicking the scroll wheel to close tabs/open links.\n\n**So, what do you think? I'm thinking Surface Laptop, but I'm worried about longevity (mostly battery life).**\n\nThankyou!",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone, 2 weeks ago I sent my Lenovo legion to a repair shop after it incurred into some minor screen damage (still usable I just needed to plug it into an external monitor). After I gave it to the repair shop they started taking too long and when I asked for updates they said they needed to import some pieces and that's what was taking too long. Unbeknownst to me during these weeks they went on a minor holiday, despite the fact I told them I had a thesis to write and that in the meantime they could give me back my laptop temporarily. Fed up with the waiting, I demanded that to be returned, only for them to disassemble it the same morning I came back to take it and asking me for one more day. After one day I took it back and now it doesn't start anymore, the BIOS doesn't start, and Windows recovery USB doesn't work either. I looked inside but nothing has been stolen. What could have they done with it?(They asked for my password) How can I at least salvage the situation?",

    "selftext": "So as the title implies, for some reason GHelper thinks HDR is active, even though my system doesn't even support it (Asus ROG Strix G18 (2024)). On top of that, I'm getting an issue commonly experienced when HDR is, in fact, on; my cursor is overexposed (washed out, light colors), except when dragging windows. First I thought it was Nvidia's fault since it only occurred when I was on the NVIDIA GPU only display mode, but after another restart it started happening when I'm on Optimus as well...\n\nThis led me to think that something is tricking my system into thinking it's using HDR, but I can't for the life of me figure out what that something is. I've checked everything that comes to mind, both Nvidia's settings and my Windows settings. In Windows settings it is clearly stated that only HDR Video is supported, but \"Use HDR\" isn't. In the Nvidia settings the only HDR-related setting that I can find is HDR under RTX Video Enhancement, but whether I turn it on or off does not make any difference.\n\nIf anyone knows how to handle this, I'd be pleased to receive feedback.",

The Zenbook lineup has many variants. I really liked the A14, but it‚Äôs quite expensive and comes with the Snapdragon X Elite chip, which isn‚Äôt compatible with Premiere Pro.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI‚Äôm a former journalist and content editor, now working as an academic editor ‚Äî but I want to get into content creation for YouTube + Instagram (short films, Reels, and video/audio storytelling).\n\n**My workflow includes:**\n\n* Editing long docs (Word, PDFs, AI tools)\n* Video editing (Premiere Pro / DaVinci Resolve)\n* Digital art + thumbnails\n* AI / ML GPU-accelerated work\n* Voiceovers / narration (I‚Äôll use external mic + headphones, so built-in audio isn‚Äôt a big concern)\n\n**What I‚Äôm looking for:**\n\n* RTX 4050/4060 or similar GPU\n* Colour-accurate display (sRGB/OLED preferred)\n* Good thermals & sustained performance\n* Durable build (solid lid + comfortable keyboard, but I can use my external keyboard too)\n* Not too heavy, ideally under 2-2.5 kg\n* Battery life can be average\n\n**Budget: ‚Çπ70k‚Äì‚Çπ1L ($750-$1200)**\nI also plan to buy a mic + good headphones, so looking for best value-for-performance setup rather than overspending.\n\nWould love recommendations for models that balance GPU power, display quality, build, and portability ‚Äî and any current deals worth checking. \n\nAlso, is it better to buy during Diwali or post Diwali? I've never bought a laptop on my own and don't really know much about computers, so any help would be great. Thanks!",

My main uses will be homework, basic stuff like Tryhackme, If possible Ill dual boot a linux distro for practice but if I can't Ill use an emulator. \n\nMy question is, is this worth it for the price I'm paying or are there better options out there?

I woke up to the display completely frozen on the Lock Screen (no mouse movement or anything) and the fan going crazy but no overheating (there was no heat coming from the laptop at all just the fan was very loud). The mute microphone button had also been turned on for some reason and would not turn off. I force shut down the laptop and when I tried to turn it back on I was met with a power LED (no flashing, just static) but no display. My keyboard would flash as though the laptop was being turned on but no boot on the display.  \n\nI‚Äôve tried resetting the graphics card using win+ctrl+shift+b and doing a hard reboot by holding the power button in for 30 seconds and nothing has worked. I currently have the laptop off charging to let it stand by for a bit before trying again.\n\nI study film and need this laptop for uni as it has all my editing software on it and deadlines are coming up. I don‚Äôt have the money to bring it to a repair store right now so if someone could help me find a manual fix I‚Äôd be eternally grateful ü•≤\n\n",

    "selftext": "My current laptop is a MacBook Pro I‚Äôve had for over six years. As of today it‚Äôs practically unusable with a battery that lasts about three hours (all I ever use it for is study and video calls), it also takes ages to charge and overheats if I join a meeting, open more than a few tabs, or try to charge it while using it.\n\nBeing autistic I really don‚Äôt want to have to learn a new system(I‚Äôm terrible with tech) I know MacBooks have controversial reputation though I‚Äôm not sure why. If I were to buy the same make and model second hand (with a new battery) would it last me at all? Or do I need to bite the bullet and get a reliable Lenovo or something?\n\nEdit: I only do video calls a couple of times a week, usually less. I use my laptop in three one hour blocks a day to prevent it from overheating and turn it off (not sleep mode) in between so it cools down.",

I have an Android phone.\n* I store my files on both Google Drive and OneDrive (and don't really store things locally, but I use the sync apps).\n\nI'm drawn to the MacBook Air due to it's battery life and reliability. But I'm drawn to the Surface due to it's familiarity and customisability. There are a few Windows features I use regularly, and I don't know if I could give them up:\n\n* Ability to copy and paste file paths in Explorer.\n* Snipping Tool.\n* The task bar (each window having it's own icon, being able to hover over the icons and see previews).\n* Easily snapping windows on the screen using keyboard shortcuts.\n* Centre clicking the scroll wheel to close tabs/open links.\n\n**So, what do you think? I'm thinking Surface Laptop, but I'm worried about longevity (mostly battery life).**\n\nThankyou!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI‚Äôve been troubleshooting my HP Omen 17-cb0040nr (2019, i7-9750H + RTX 2070 + 144 Hz G-Sync panel) for years, and it‚Äôs finally reaching a weird, half-alive state. Here‚Äôs the full story in chronological order.\n\nüïê 2019 ‚Äì Early 2020\n\nLaptop worked great for the first ~6 months.\n\nHeavy gaming (Apex Legends, etc.) pushed GPU temps to 80‚Äì85 ¬∞C.\n\nThe display would suddenly go black, sound would freeze, and I had to force shutdown.\n\nAfter cooling down, it would boot normally again.\n\nLag when plugged in: Occasionally, since purchase, performance would drop badly until I unplugged and re-plugged the charger, then FPS would instantly recover.\n\nüßπ Mid 2020 ‚Äì 2021\n\nFound dust clogging the cooling system; cleaned it thoroughly.\n\nTemps improved and random shutdowns reduced.\n\nAround 2021, HP UEFI Diagnostics flagged a ‚ÄúVideo Memory [F] failure‚Äù ‚Üí confirmed early VRAM instability on the GPU.\n\nFrom this point onward, the GPU remained functional but unstable under high load.\n\n‚ö° 2022 ‚Äì 2024\n\nContinued gaming on medium settings; GPU stayed below 78 ¬∞C.\n\nOccasional driver crashes or screen flickers.\n\nNo major shutdowns, but instability kept creeping back.\n\nüîã 2025\n\nHP Smart reported a ‚Äúblown charge-state fuse‚Äù ‚Äî battery stopped charging completely. Removed the battery since this. I get CMOS error and I press enter to see boot (hp omen logo).\n\nBegan using the laptop plugged in only, like a desktop.\n\nThe power button started blinking continuously even during normal operation ‚Üí likely due to the battery-circuit fault.\n\nSystem still booted and worked fine on AC.\n\nüí• Current State (2025 October)\n\nThe internal laptop display stays black most of the time (backlight faintly glows).\n\nExternal 200 Hz monitor (HDMI) works well ‚Äî I can even play Apex Legends for hours on medium settings with GPU VRAM capped to 4 GB.\n\n\nNVIDIA Control Panel won‚Äôt open, though the RTX 2070 is visible in Device Manager and Task Manager.\n\nBoot behavior:\n\nExternal monitor connected via HDMI.\n\nPress power ‚Üí CMOS error occurs(sometimes it wont be displayed in either of the displays, occurs when I start the laptop after a long time, like half a day etc) (I press enter to proceed with booting, as one can see if windows is booted or not by pressing caps lock to see if the button lights are working or not) \n\nWhat happens next in a successful boot is, the powee button light goes off and turns on in like 2 sec, I press entee agan and the same cycle happens for one more time (2 to 3 timez at max), and then the external display connected (sometimes internal display too) gets hp omen logo boot screen. Post this, if windows login acreen comes, in atleast one of the displays, it is a successful boot. Else, I have to force shutdown the pc and start again\n\nSystem reboots itself once or twice.\n\nHP Omen logo appears ‚Äî almost always on the external monitor.\n\nDisplay outcomes (approx. 10 boots):\n\n5 times ‚Üí only external monitor shows the Windows login screen, laptop panel stays blank.\n\n1 time ‚Üí both monitors work correctly and internal 144 Hz panel shows Windows login.\n\n4 times ‚Üí internal panel = black, external = HP logo only (no Windows output). I can still log in blindly and shut down via Alt + F4, so the system is running headless.\n\nWhen I try to ‚ÄúDuplicate display,‚Äù both displays drop to 1024√ó768 @ 60 Hz, the only modes Windows detects for the laptop screen.\n\nüîé Current Symptoms Summary\n\nGPU and HDMI output work reliably; internal panel almost dead.\n\nCMOS error on every cold boot ‚Üí BIOS resets device detection.\n\nHP Diagnostics previously confirmed Video Memory failure.\n\nüí≠ My Suspicions\n\nPartial GPU VRAM degradation or faulty eDP (output to internal panel).\n\nPossible loose or damaged eDP cable/panel connector.\n\nWeak CMOS battery causing repeated re-detection and boot loops.\n\nBattery-charging fuse blown (confirmed), forcing AC-only operation.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è What Still Works\n\nExternal monitor gaming at 200 Hz for hours.\n\nAll USB, audio, and Ethernet functions.\n\nInternal panel sometimes returns to life for one boot, then fails again.\n\n‚ùìLooking for Advice\n\nHas anyone seen an RTX-series GPU that works fine externally but fails internally?\n\nCould a failing VRAM or eDP transmitter cause intermittent CMOS errors?\n\nIs a GPU reball worth it on this board (L50873-006), or should I hunt for a replacement motherboard?\n\nAny way to disable the internal panel entirely to speed up boot?\n\nAny insights or similar experiences would really help.\nThanks for reading ‚Äî posting this so future Omen owners facing half-dead GPUs can find a full timeline too.",

After I gave it to the repair shop they started taking too long and when I asked for updates they said they needed to import some pieces and that's what was taking too long. Unbeknownst to me during these weeks they went on a minor holiday, despite the fact I told them I had a thesis to write and that in the meantime they could give me back my laptop temporarily. Fed up with the waiting, I demanded that to be returned, only for them to disassemble it the same morning I came back to take it and asking me for one more day. After one day I took it back and now it doesn't start anymore, the BIOS doesn't start, and Windows recovery USB doesn't work either. I looked inside but nothing has been stolen. What could have they done with it?(They asked for my password) How can I at least salvage the situation?",

At what settings and FPS do you want?** Minecraft, 60fps at least\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** none\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** none",

    "selftext": "So as the title implies, for some reason GHelper thinks HDR is active, even though my system doesn't even support it (Asus ROG Strix G18 (2024)). On top of that, I'm getting an issue commonly experienced when HDR is, in fact, on; my cursor is overexposed (washed out, light colors), except when dragging windows. First I thought it was Nvidia's fault since it only occurred when I was on the NVIDIA GPU only display mode, but after another restart it started happening when I'm on Optimus as well...\n\nThis led me to think that something is tricking my system into thinking it's using HDR, but I can't for the life of me figure out what that something is. I've checked everything that comes to mind, both Nvidia's settings and my Windows settings. In Windows settings it is clearly stated that only HDR Video is supported, but \"Use HDR\" isn't. In the Nvidia settings the only HDR-related setting that I can find is HDR under RTX Video Enhancement, but whether I turn it on or off does not make any difference.\n\nIf anyone knows how to handle this, I'd be pleased to receive feedback.",

It was constant pain. It's got lots of great memories but I think I have to let go already. But to let go means to get a new one. The problem is: I don't have money. To be in a country like mine and being a broke teenager, it's almost impossible to save up money fast enough to still get my school work done. Right now I'm mostly borrowing my mother's laptop and it's just not consistent because she needs it for her work too and our schedule lines up and I end up never being able to use it. Anyways my whish for this Christmas is a new laptop so I could do my school work and possibly have an online job.",

I have an Android phone.\n* I store my files on both Google Drive and OneDrive (and don't really store things locally, but I use the sync apps).\n\nI'm drawn to the MacBook Air due to it's battery life and reliability. But I'm drawn to the Surface due to it's familiarity and customisability. There are a few Windows features I use regularly, and I don't know if I could give them up:\n\n* Ability to copy and paste file paths in Explorer.\n* Snipping Tool.\n* The task bar (each window having it's own icon, being able to hover over the icons and see previews).\n* Easily snapping windows on the screen using keyboard shortcuts.\n* Centre clicking the scroll wheel to close tabs/open links.\n\n**So, what do you think? I'm thinking Surface Laptop, but I'm worried about longevity (mostly battery life).**\n\nThankyou!",

Did I get a toast card or can it be my newly installed ram?\n\nSo I just replaced my GTX 1070 with a used RTX2080ti I got from eBay. Plugged it in and downloaded the newest drivers and tried playing the arc raiders server slam and was met with a gpu hung error whenever I loaded into a game. Tried running cs2 and it ran just fine so I tried another UE5 game(Avowed) and it too crashed when I loaded into the world. Both games ran just fine on the gtx1070. \nTried everything under the sun to try and get it to work and everyone is telling me to send the card back. BUT I just installed some used DDR4 ram(2x16, only 2 slots on motherboard) this weekend the day before I got the GPU. This morning while I was waiting on the company I bought the GPU from to open I decided to see if I could figure anything else out. I went into the BIOS and upped my ram speed to 2666 and avowed didn‚Äôt crash immediately this time.(took about 10 min) That led me to look into ram being the culprit and found this \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/4155833/fixed-nvlddmkm-gaming-video-crash-error-(bad-ram)\n\nI have already initiated the return process for the card. Do I just ship it back and try another card or should I look into the ram some more? I have my original 12GB of ram still and I can try one stick at a time to see if it‚Äôs a bad stick. \n\nAny help would be appreciated as this seems to be plaguing those that run into this error. ",

    "selftext": "(Apologies if my Reddit etiquette is poor; I'm not on here much)\n\nI've been on laptops for a long time now, but I've had 2 crap out in less than 5 years, so it's time to build a new rig. Problem: The last Custom build was a Win7 machine my dad made for me, so I'm a little out of my depth. Pcpartpicker has helped me put a prospective build together, but considering I didn't know what half of the terms on there meant when I started, I'm hoping some experienced builders can lend their guidance.\n\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/LdgWgn\n\nThis is what I've got, but before I pull the trigger I wanna know if any of these components are wildly above/below the rest in performance so I'm not bottlenecking right out of the gate. I want this build to be powerful with the ability to upgrade eventually once these guts get old without having to start from scratch. The heaviest games I can think of off the top of my head I want this to run while Discord and a few internet tabs are open are (moderately modded but nothing insane I don't think) Minecraft, lightly modded BG3, and PEAK. \n\nCompatability was green but noted I may need a mounting adapter to fit this cooler into the board,  and that RAM clearance may or may not work out. I wanna know if I'm making a huge mistake with any of these parts and what you'd use in that space; also, below the row for monitors on pcpartpicker, there's lists for a bunch of extra stuff down there; Network Adapters, Case Fans, etc. Are any of those things necessary/a good idea? I have a headset, keyboard and mouse, functional if a little old at this point, but the rest I'm not sure about. \n\nOne more thing: I'll be getting my now dead laptop back from it's unsuccessful trip to the repair shop soon, and want to clone it's drives to this new prospective rig. I'm pretty sure the last time I \"cloned\" a drive, it was a bunch of manual copy/pasting with an external storage drive... Is there any common builder wisdom about cloning drives I should know about? I think I can figure out how to actually do it myself between friends and the internet, but I'd rather learn about potential pitfalls on reddit than firsthand.\n\nThanks!",

Should I go 5900x which is listing at $256 on Amazon or a 5700x3d which is listing anywhere from $300-330 USD on Amazon or Newegg. 5950x ($287) is not out of the question but that's more productivity. I do mostly gaming and sometimes excel sheets for work. \n\nI don't see myself going to AM5 for at least two years. To me it makes sense to spend less than $350 for a new CPU vs 700+ for CPU, Motherboard, RAM etc. \n\nI've also gotten into PS3 and X360 Emulation the last few months if that helps with choice at all since I know CPU is pretty heavily used from my experience so far.

Mostly a software question*\n\n'Help with Adrenaline minimal install'\n\nI'm switching from an Nvidia rtx 3080 over to a RX 9070 and I need some info on the minimal install option for the adrenaline software. I tried looking up everything in regards to a very simple feature for it but can't find anything concrete.....an fps cap. I'll confess. I'm used to the nvidial control panel and using that to cap the fps and enable driver vsync cause I had a few older games mess up by using the in game caps (GTA 5 and mgs v) and still want to be able to use a control panel ESC system and use MSI afterburner for the overlay for metrics. I know that the old catalyst software is still available but no doubt its probably out of date and can only imagine it might not work well with the latest games, even though I've had no problems with the nvidia control panel so far. \n\nSo yeah. Does the minimal install still allow you to configure individual games, in regards to settings similar to control panel? Ie fps limits, v sync, af settimgs etc. I ask cause I read that's only allowed on the full install of adrenaline, but I don't want that because the over clocking can conflict with MSI afterburner (even though this time around I'm just going to run it at stock. No oc and no tweaking)\n\nAny advice or info would be appreciated. I was kinda hoping I'd find some in depth comparisons but haven't found anything. Again thanks to whoever can help!",

(*)\n- I eventually plan on purchasing a GPU separately during sales, or when it's cheaper, but it's not a priority as of now \n- Quiet, idk if that's possible considering the budget constaints, this is a small bonus, if I can use my PC without waking up everyone in the house that's ideal (*) I don't need a fighter jet in my house.\n- Decent memory space, my old pc was plagued with an extremely small storage space, I'd like to have multiple games downloaded if possible, again this is a big IF, idk how memory storage scales in the parts industry price-wise, but I can figure this out at a later date if necessary.\n\nCaveats:\nI cannot wait for black friday or sales for most parts, I'd like a complete PC and I need it with urgency, I can buy parts like the GPU and extra memory later on during sales.  \n\nTell me if extra information is required, I believe Reddit allows me to edit posts, so I will do so if necessary.\nI'll appreciate all the help given.\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, after a long time sitting on the fence, I've decided to pull the trigger and build my very first PC. Now, I'm a complete beginner, and know little to nothing about building them. Whatever I've gathered so far is based on a few Google searches (though I plan to do more research), but since black Friday deals will be soon upon us, I thought I'd get started putting together a PC Build List. \n\nA bit of necessary information: I already own a steam deck, have for about 3 or so years, and I love it, absolutely love it. But it's just that, there are certain games (mainly fps/co-op games) that I'd much rather play with a mouse and keyboard seamlessly: which is the main reason for wanting to take on this behemoth task. Now, does this even require a PC? I'm not sure, I'm tryna save as much as I can, so if I don't even have to do this, and there are other ways, I'm more than happy to listen. Some games I'm considering are Dead By Daylight, Marvel Rivals, Halo, etc. I don't need to play these games at the highest setting possible, so I'm totally fine with compromise \n\nAll that being said, I have put together a draft PCPartPicker list: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ZnmzJn\n\nPlease, let me know your suggestions!",

My guess from looking at the specs is because it runs on an HDD not SSD - all the other specs look fine (8GB ram and Ryzen 5 3400G).\n\nI opened it up to try and figure out if I can add an SSD but it looks to be there are no extra connections to the power supply and so I would just need to replace the HDD directly, based on the pictures is that correct? I also had some other questions:\n\n1 - Will any SSD be compatible and with any storage capacity?\n\n2 - I would rather clone than do a total new install is this possible or not because there is no way to plug in both the SSD and HDD at the same time.\n\n3 - Is my thinking right that the HDD is the cause of the slow speeds?\n\nEDIT: Just looking at the hardware manual it appears there is an m.2 slot, but in small form factor. Is there a way to see what is compatible as this seems like the logical way to upgrade.\n\nPictures:\n\n[https://imgbox.com/859YtMj3](https://imgbox.com/859YtMj3)\n\n[https://imgbox.com/bGAPbZeN](https://imgbox.com/bGAPbZeN)\n\n[https://imgbox.com/XJu84oq7](https://imgbox.com/XJu84oq7)",

I'm not super sure about what GPU to get for my needs. I've seen AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB as one but I would like other suggestions under AMD only. I use an ultra wide 1080p monitor spec'd below and would like to comfortably game most things at that quality (casuals, MMOs, RPGs, FPS like BF6). I also want to get into music production and video editing, for music recording and for podcasting. If you recommend any other upgrades like PSU or CPU or anything else then I'd appreciate that, but I think the RAM and GPU are what I'm focused on for my uses while keeping everything else constant if able to. Also, is it worth keeping my current GPU or should I sell it, if that may/may not factor into the effects of the upgraded build?\n\nHere's my rig pulled from my order:\n\n‚Ä¢ Monitor\nLG 29UM68-P 29-Inch 21:9 UltraWide IPS Monitor with FreeSync\n\n‚Ä¢ Case\n1 x iBUYPOWER Tt Versa N27 Gaming Case - White - White\n\n‚Ä¢ LED Fan Lighting\n1 x 3x [RGB] Thermaltake Riing 12 Series High Static Pressure 120mm RGB LED Fan\n\n‚Ä¢ Processor\n1 x AMD Ryzen 7 2700 Processor (8x 3.2GHZ/20MB L3 Cache)\n\n‚Ä¢ Processor Cooling\n1 x Thermaltake Water 3.0 Riing 240mm RGB Liquid Cooling System - [Ryzen]\n\n‚Ä¢ Memory\n1 x 16 GB [8 GB x2] DDR4-2666 Memory Module - Certified Major Brand Gaming Memory\n\n‚Ä¢ Video Card\n1 x AMD Radeon RX 580 - 8GB (VR-Ready) - Single Card\n\n‚Ä¢ Motherboard\n1 x MSI X470 GAMING PLUS -- Mystic RGB, 3x PCIe x16, 2x USB 3.1 Gen 2, 4x USB 3.1 Gen 1, 2x USB 2.0, 2x M.2\n\n‚Ä¢ Power Supply\n1 x 600 Watt - Thermaltake Smart Series - 80 PLUS Gold\n\n‚Ä¢ Primary Hard Drive\n1 x 240 GB WD Green SSD -- Read: 540MB/s, Write: 465MB/s - Single Drive\n\n‚Ä¢ Data Hard Drive\n1 x - 2 TB HARD DRIVE 7200RPM",

    "selftext": "Tried to post this to r/playstation and it got removed immediately. If you know of another place I should post this instead of here I can post there as well. I've been doing a lot of research on mainly 3 internal SSDs for PS5 since I plan on upgrading my storage. I want a 4 TB and compared the Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black 850, and Seagate Firecuda 530 (or 530R as well, which is slightly different). However, there are many threads talking about known issues with the Samsung 990 Pro and Seagate Firecuda 530. The 990 Pro issues were allegedly solved nearly 2 years ago, so I'm wondering if that's true and they are safe to buy now. Also, the Seagate problem comes from using a Phison E18 controller and I hear the Seagate was the only one to wait to firmware update a fix until June of this year. I'm not tech savvy, so I plan on just buying and sticking it in the PS5. Can anyone confirm if the Samsung issues from years ago have been resolved? Do you think Seagate's fix has been applied to SSDs not sold and are safe to buy for the extra endurance (significantly higher than competition)? I know these threads are old news and have come up several times, but I can't seem to find information regarding if the 990 Pro issues have truly been fixed. Also the Firecuda fix seems so recent that I doubt they are ready to go and fixed straight off the shelves.\n\nTLDR: Looking to buy internal SSD: Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black 850, or Seagate Firecuda 530. 1.) Have 990 Pro issues from years ago been fixed? 2.) Do you think the Firecuda fix for Phison E18 controllers from June are safe to buy off shelves? 3.) Which internal SSD should I buy for my PS5 with a heatsink?",

    "selftext": "I recently noticed a sudden increase in my 3090 FE temps, my card was running at 86¬∞C under load when it used to run at around 74¬∞C before. I decided to change the thermal paste and also repad it while I'm at it, so I ordered some Gelid Extreme 1.5mm pads and Thermalright TFX thermal paste. After repadding the card and putting some new thermal paste, here were the results:\n\nGPU Temp: 86¬∞C / VRAM Temp: 90¬∞C\n\nI reopened the card to see what's going on. I pressed on the pads to make them thinner, reapplied thermal paste and made sure to remount the leaf spring in a cross pattern with even torque. Here were the results:\n\nGPU Temp: 86¬∞C / VRAM Temp: 95¬∞C\n\nI reopened the card again. This time I change the thermal paste with some Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut. I also tried to make the pads as thin as possible. After remounting the cards the same way as before, here were the results:\n\nGPU Temp: 84¬∞C / VRAM Temp: 100¬∞C\n\nSome progress with the GPU temp but the VRAM temp was getting worse, make the pads thinner probably made them less effective. So I ordered some Gelid Extreme 1mm pads. After replacing the pads and repasting the GPU with the same thermal paste, here are the results:\n\nGPU Temp: 88¬∞C / VRAM Temp: 110¬∞C\n\nI'm really confused about what's going on there...",

I'm no aficionado when it comes to hardware (I don't have alot of opportunity to tinker with parts) but I did my best looking from sources like Daniel Owen and the PSU Cultist Network, and here's what I ended up choosing for the most part. I'd love to get your opinions on this because when I put these into the PCPartPicker website, it told me that the PSU exceeds the recommended length of 140mm for the casing, and that the RAM clearance with CPU Coolers are not checked.

Did I get a toast card or can it be my newly installed ram?\n\nSo I just replaced my GTX 1070 with a used RTX2080ti I got from eBay. Plugged it in and downloaded the newest drivers and tried playing the arc raiders server slam and was met with a gpu hung error whenever I loaded into a game. Tried running cs2 and it ran just fine so I tried another UE5 game(Avowed) and it too crashed when I loaded into the world. Both games ran just fine on the gtx1070. \nTried everything under the sun to try and get it to work and everyone is telling me to send the card back. BUT I just installed some used DDR4 ram(2x16, only 2 slots on motherboard) this weekend the day before I got the GPU. This morning while I was waiting on the company I bought the GPU from to open I decided to see if I could figure anything else out. I went into the BIOS and upped my ram speed to 2666 and avowed didn‚Äôt crash immediately this time.(took about 10 min) That led me to look into ram being the culprit and found this \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/4155833/fixed-nvlddmkm-gaming-video-crash-error-(bad-ram)\n\nI have already initiated the return process for the card. Do I just ship it back and try another card or should I look into the ram some more? I have my original 12GB of ram still and I can try one stick at a time to see if it‚Äôs a bad stick. \n\nAny help would be appreciated as this seems to be plaguing those that run into this error. ",

    "selftext": "(Apologies if my Reddit etiquette is poor; I'm not on here much)\n\nI've been on laptops for a long time now, but I've had 2 crap out in less than 5 years, so it's time to build a new rig. Problem: The last Custom build was a Win7 machine my dad made for me, so I'm a little out of my depth. Pcpartpicker has helped me put a prospective build together, but considering I didn't know what half of the terms on there meant when I started, I'm hoping some experienced builders can lend their guidance.\n\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/LdgWgn\n\nThis is what I've got, but before I pull the trigger I wanna know if any of these components are wildly above/below the rest in performance so I'm not bottlenecking right out of the gate. I want this build to be powerful with the ability to upgrade eventually once these guts get old without having to start from scratch. The heaviest games I can think of off the top of my head I want this to run while Discord and a few internet tabs are open are (moderately modded but nothing insane I don't think) Minecraft, lightly modded BG3, and PEAK. \n\nCompatability was green but noted I may need a mounting adapter to fit this cooler into the board,  and that RAM clearance may or may not work out. I wanna know if I'm making a huge mistake with any of these parts and what you'd use in that space; also, below the row for monitors on pcpartpicker, there's lists for a bunch of extra stuff down there; Network Adapters, Case Fans, etc. Are any of those things necessary/a good idea? I have a headset, keyboard and mouse, functional if a little old at this point, but the rest I'm not sure about. \n\nOne more thing: I'll be getting my now dead laptop back from it's unsuccessful trip to the repair shop soon, and want to clone it's drives to this new prospective rig. I'm pretty sure the last time I \"cloned\" a drive, it was a bunch of manual copy/pasting with an external storage drive... Is there any common builder wisdom about cloning drives I should know about? I think I can figure out how to actually do it myself between friends and the internet, but I'd rather learn about potential pitfalls on reddit than firsthand.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Apolgies for full post I was unable to comment in the simple questions section. \n\nShould be a quick question hopefully. Current gaming on a 1440p 165hz ASUS Tuff monitor with 3080 ASUS ROG Strix and a Ryzen 5 5600 on a Crosshair VIII Dark Hero with 48GB of RAM 3200MHz. \n\nI want to upgrade but stay on AM4. Should I go 5900x which is listing at $256 on Amazon or a 5700x3d which is listing anywhere from $300-330 USD on Amazon or Newegg. 5950x ($287) is not out of the question but that's more productivity. I do mostly gaming and sometimes excel sheets for work. \n\nI don't see myself going to AM5 for at least two years. To me it makes sense to spend less than $350 for a new CPU vs 700+ for CPU, Motherboard, RAM etc. \n\nI've also gotten into PS3 and X360 Emulation the last few months if that helps with choice at all since I know CPU is pretty heavily used from my experience so far.

Mostly a software question*\n\n'Help with Adrenaline minimal install'\n\nI'm switching from an Nvidia rtx 3080 over to a RX 9070 and I need some info on the minimal install option for the adrenaline software. I tried looking up everything in regards to a very simple feature for it but can't find anything concrete.....an fps cap. I'll confess. I'm used to the nvidial control panel and using that to cap the fps and enable driver vsync cause I had a few older games mess up by using the in game caps (GTA 5 and mgs v) and still want to be able to use a control panel ESC system and use MSI afterburner for the overlay for metrics. I know that the old catalyst software is still available but no doubt its probably out of date and can only imagine it might not work well with the latest games, even though I've had no problems with the nvidia control panel so far. \n\nSo yeah. Does the minimal install still allow you to configure individual games, in regards to settings similar to control panel? Ie fps limits, v sync, af settimgs etc. I ask cause I read that's only allowed on the full install of adrenaline, but I don't want that because the over clocking can conflict with MSI afterburner (even though this time around I'm just going to run it at stock. No oc and no tweaking)\n\nAny advice or info would be appreciated. I was kinda hoping I'd find some in depth comparisons but haven't found anything. Again thanks to whoever can help!",

BUT I just installed some used DDR4 ram(2x16, only 2 slots on motherboard) this weekend the day before I got the GPU. This morning while I was waiting on the company I bought the GPU from to open I decided to see if I could figure anything else out. I went into the BIOS and upped my ram speed to 2666 and avowed didn‚Äôt crash immediately this time.(took about 10 min) That led me to look into ram being the culprit and found this \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/4155833/fixed-nvlddmkm-gaming-video-crash-error-(bad-ram)\n\nI have already initiated the return process for the card.

    "selftext": "(Apologies if my Reddit etiquette is poor; I'm not on here much)\n\nI've been on laptops for a long time now, but I've had 2 crap out in less than 5 years, so it's time to build a new rig. Problem: The last Custom build was a Win7 machine my dad made for me, so I'm a little out of my depth. Pcpartpicker has helped me put a prospective build together, but considering I didn't know what half of the terms on there meant when I started, I'm hoping some experienced builders can lend their guidance.\n\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/LdgWgn\n\nThis is what I've got, but before I pull the trigger I wanna know if any of these components are wildly above/below the rest in performance so I'm not bottlenecking right out of the gate. I want this build to be powerful with the ability to upgrade eventually once these guts get old without having to start from scratch. The heaviest games I can think of off the top of my head I want this to run while Discord and a few internet tabs are open are (moderately modded but nothing insane I don't think) Minecraft, lightly modded BG3, and PEAK. \n\nCompatability was green but noted I may need a mounting adapter to fit this cooler into the board,  and that RAM clearance may or may not work out. I wanna know if I'm making a huge mistake with any of these parts and what you'd use in that space; also, below the row for monitors on pcpartpicker, there's lists for a bunch of extra stuff down there; Network Adapters, Case Fans, etc. Are any of those things necessary/a good idea? I have a headset, keyboard and mouse, functional if a little old at this point, but the rest I'm not sure about. \n\nOne more thing: I'll be getting my now dead laptop back from it's unsuccessful trip to the repair shop soon, and want to clone it's drives to this new prospective rig. I'm pretty sure the last time I \"cloned\" a drive, it was a bunch of manual copy/pasting with an external storage drive... Is there any common builder wisdom about cloning drives I should know about? I think I can figure out how to actually do it myself between friends and the internet, but I'd rather learn about potential pitfalls on reddit than firsthand.\n\nThanks!",

Just 1080p ultra or 1440p medium/high maybe. \n\nThis is my first upgrade/build so idk if it's unrealistic",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been wondering about this for a while. Why don‚Äôt we have headphones that can tell if a sound‚Äôs coming from above or below when you tilt your head? It‚Äôs pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound‚Äôs coming from. I don‚Äôt see any technical reason why we can‚Äôt have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response ‚Äì there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it‚Äôs amazing that AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Hus√°k! üòä), but soon,¬†**thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his¬†**passion, enthusiasm, and desire**¬†are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Hus√°k himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to¬†**expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile ‚Äì and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point,¬†**we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that¬†**Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind¬†**Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*‚ÄúHey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors ‚Äî If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you‚Äôre gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step ‚Äî launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign ‚Äî just like old times ‚Äî and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let‚Äôs rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let‚Äôs build that castle from the ground up ‚Äî together.‚Äù*\n\nWe can‚Äôt express how much this means to us.¬†**Warhorse Studios inspired us**¬†\\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives¬†**Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let‚Äôs carry this legacy forward.¬†**Together!**\n\nKickstarter:¬†[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord:¬†[https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit:¬†[r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook:¬†[https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX:¬†[https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website:¬†[https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

    "selftext": "I purchased Ryse: Son of Rome on August 29th. This was the first time I ever purchased from Humble Bundle. At the time and to this day, I have not seen a banner on Humble's store indicating they are out of keys for Ryse: Son of Rome. I am using Chrome and not running any ad blocker, so I suspect this is not an issue with my personal browser. These banners are referenced in Humble's FAQ on key exhaustion. I have exchanged 3 messages with humble support inquiring about the lack of a banner and if the 60-day refund window applies if I have not received a key. Not only did they take on average 7 days to respond they also talked around my questions and provided no real support. I am willing to give a great deal of leeway, after all, this is for charity. That said, the dishonesty or ineptitude of the support team and the implication that Humble can keep my money and provide me with nothing in return just leaves me with a gross feeling that I can't shake. I will never use this storefront again. I have only ever heard good things about Humble. Am I just phenomenally unlucky, or is this a common experience no one talks about?",

Somewhere.\n\nThe biggest twist, is that the battles are fewer, but longer, with new enemies spawning, dropping loot, and allowing you to craft DURING combat.\n\nIt's a bit like an OVA anime from a larger universe.\n\nWe launched in April, but the game is on sale now, and we added a real nice update during the Autumn sale, so I thought I'd give it a try and tell you about the game.\n\nDesign-wise, I tried to focus on having fewer, but more tactically worthwhile spells, and enemies that are mechanically interesting.\n\nSince launch we've put out a few free updates, and hope to make more. Of note is the extra difficult secret level in the final world. We're very attentive to feedback, and the last update was about helping players deal with how they experienced randomness.\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, both the good and the bad stuff.",

    "selftext": "Just now I was playing mafia 2. I am 9 hours into the game and I started the game with hard difficulty like I have started to do with all of my games recently. I have come at a level that is simply impossible to cross, not because of any skill issue but simply because this game has a bad 'Hard' difficulty mode.\n\nThere are games where hard difficulty simply means a basic buff to all enemies. They function like normal npc's but their damaged is increased, they spot you unreasonably fast, and even their pistols shoot kilometers (miles) away and it takes a takes a whole mag to kill one enemy. Your gameplay does not change. You still take cover and shoot, you simply stay in cover for longer, and have to shoot the same enemy twice as much, but its the same.\n\nIn this particular mission in mafia, the enemies are just unfair. Rather than enemies coordinating better, they and their guns have simply been buffed. And I am not lying when I say this, I cannot shoot a Thompson at my target after a certain distance because of insane recoil, my enemies, with that same Thompson, are killing me with 2 bullets from twice that distance. Molotov cocktails fall in front of my cover but I still get damage, and the most baffling part is that I get some damage even behind covers.\n\nThis is a bad hard mode, although understandable because the game came out in 2010. In such a mode, you can overcome with skill only to be lead to such an instance where skill can not overcome the bad design. Like how my enemy keeps throwing molotovs every 5 seconds in a small space filled with constantly spawning enemies, I peak and someone shoots me, I play smart and get killed by a Molotov that isint even near me.\n\nI am also playing wolfenstein currently and it has a much better hard mode. Its actually challenging but most of all, its reasonably challenging, you can improve and get better or retry until you finally clear a level. Enemy damage does increase but they don't turn into bullet sponges, enemies coordinate better and have better reflexes rather than being one shot kill. In Wolfenstein you just have to plan better, remember the med kits and the Armour and use them strategically. But mafia 2 doesnt offer me any such option, the gameplay is yet the same regardless of difficulty.",

We initially made this as a sequel to Liminascent, our previous first-person platformer, and renamed it because here in France \"Liminascent\" isn't easy to pronounce...\n\nWell, we had a ton of fun making the game as a side project (besides our boring main jobs), and we are excited to see people playing the demo. It's our first solo project on Steam, as we already released a game with a publisher, but now we want more freedom, hence the self-publishing. We'd be more than happy to get feedback on the game, see what you like, what you dislike so we can enhance it and hopefully make something great in the long run! We're aiming for a release by the end of the year, as most of the \"complete\" game is ready.\n\nThe demo here is just a part of the complete game, to get the feeling of it and see if it's for you. We will probably keep the demo up permanently, as we believe it's better to be able to try a game before buying it.\n\nThat's it! Hope you'll enjoy it. I'll be available to answer any questions you might have.\n\nHere is the link of the game if you want to play!  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA\\_VERTIGO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA_VERTIGO)",

    "selftext": "**Hey, r/pcgaming!**\n\n**I‚Äôm Louis Denizet, game director at** [Hibernian Workshop](https://hibernian-workshop.com/)**, the indie studio behind the roguelite** [Astral Ascent](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280930/Astral_Ascent/) **‚Äî and I‚Äôll be happy to answer any questions you may have!**\n\nI started the studio years ago after meeting Alexandre Magnat online ‚Äî we were both self-taught and completely obsessed with pixel art, especially the kind you see in anime across different eras and styles.¬†\n\nWhat followed after a few years since this match was Astral Ascent, a colorful, fast-paced roguelite in the vein of Dead Cells with a focus on fluid combat, replayability (with 5 unique characters to choose from), and wrapped up in a pixel art style that‚Äôs by now become a signature of our work.¬†\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt our first game, but it‚Äôs the one where we finally found our footing. A bright fantasy with an underlying melancholy is how I‚Äôd describe the thematic heart of AA and we‚Äôve been incredibly happy to see how many people resonated with it.\n\n**It‚Äôs also no lie to say that Astral Ascent was the biggest step forward for us as developers in general, and we‚Äôre still incredibly thankful for the community support we received.**\n\nWe‚Äôve also recently launched our next project, [Fallen Fates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276270/Fallen_Fates/), this time a fantasy RPG (instead of a roguelite) built in collaboration with our community through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernian-workshop/fallen-fates). We‚Äôve learned a lot from our past games ‚Äî Astral Ascent most of all ‚Äî and want to take everything we love about them and carry it over into this new, even more ambitious project‚Ä¶ which, truth be told, probably won‚Äôt be done before 2028 (tentatively speaking) just because of the sheer scope of the project.\n\nIn any case, that‚Äôs the short of it about us.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a long road since we first started making games together, and each one has changed the way we think about what we do. Astral Ascent especially left a mark on us, not just in how we design but in how we see the people playing our work. It reminds us why we do this in the first place, and that‚Äôs to make beautiful games people will take joy in playing.\n\n**We‚Äôre excited to chat with you all and answer any questions whatsoever!**   \n\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you all! :)",

    "selftext": "Windows is very close to being great for gamepads. There are multiple third-party apps (like r/Playnite) that allow for a great gamepad experience in multiple aspects, however, typing is NOT one of them.\n\nA lot of games require typing, which prevents us from having a true couch gaming experience on PC, but there's an easy solution that only Microsoft can provide:\n\n**1 - Allow us to open the new on-screen keyboard (OSK), with gamepad support, that at the moment is reserved for tablets, by clicking or pressing A over text boxes, and through a gamepad button combo.**   \nThis would allow the OSK to be invoked by either simulating a mouse click with the gamepad (for older games), selecting text boxes with A (on modern games that eventually support this feature), or force-opening it with a gamepad combo for games that are particularly iffy with text boxes. This would effectively bypass the need to get out of the sofa and use a keyboard just to name your character in a new RPG, for example. \n\n**2 - Make sure the OSK, on gamepad mode, captures all gamepad inputs for itself, and does not allow these inputs to reach the game in the background.**  \nThis would prevent a big problem with the already existing Steam keyboard: if you're not playing the game with SteamInput enabled (for example, in games that already support Xbox gamepads), all the gamepad buttons being pressed while typing are also reaching the game, causing your character to walk, attack or do whatever actions correspond to the typing shortcuts, including leaving the text box in case of emulators. Capturing all inputs from the gamepad and only sending what is actually being typed (the keyboard keys) would prevent this, and massively increase compatibility with older games.\n\n**Bonus:** give us the fullscreen Windows experience for desktops, and allow it to use custom library managers (like Playnite). This would fix a lot of problems with window focus that can happen when launching games in borderless fullscreen and also make the experience more seamless. \n\nI believe these tweaks would greatly improve the gaming experience on Windows, bringing it much closer to an authentic Xbox experience.",

Each one has unique traits and drops items that can be used to craft decorations, furniture, and lures. Sometimes they get attacked by Ghosts who just want to spoil the fun.\n\nThe demo covers the first seven in-game days (around 1.5-2 hours of play). You can:\n\n* Attract and care for your first Critterlings\n* Decorate your farm and house with dozens of craftable items\n* Experiment with items that lure specific species\n* Meet the Townfolk and explore the beach\n\nIt‚Äôs colorful, weird, and hopefully very cozy.\n\nüëâ **Play the demo here:** [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2497070/Cosmic\\_Coop/]()\n\nI‚Äôll be hanging out in the comments to answer any questions about development, inspiration, or the design process.\n\nThanks for checking it out and for supporting small devs during Next Fest!",

    "selftext": "In this chat, Gooseman opens up about the challenges of starting from zero, which he's had to do more than once in his career. I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response ‚Äì there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it‚Äôs amazing that AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

It‚Äôs pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound‚Äôs coming from. I don‚Äôt see any technical reason why we can‚Äôt have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response ‚Äì there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it‚Äôs amazing that AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

I don‚Äôt see any technical reason why we can‚Äôt have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you.

    "selftext": "I don't need a significant power boost as the 4060 almost does anything i want. I struggle most with its limited 8gb of vram as i am on vr a lot and do tons of mods on different games. It practically wont run vrchat at all with avatars on, and in many games i struggle to play on anything other than low settings (which I don't actually mind too much). Ive finally hit a point which id like to play bigger games for youtube.  \n\n\nMy research has come to something like a 5070 (if it fits) or 9800 xtx (which i know little about other than it might be a better card?).  The more vram the better, but id rather not blow the bank, otherwise id rather just save and suffer for a few more years get a full new build (this time one i build myself, if i have a job that give me enough time and money to do so). \n\nThese are my main questions:\n\nWhat would be the best gpu to upgrade to from a 4060 on a r16 alienware? (Any brand as long as its compatible)  \nWhat would fit? (maximum length of 312mm i believe)  \nBest power supply to go with it?  \nWhat wont be too bottlenecked by my i7-14700f CPU? (Do i need to upgrade it?)\n\nand add any other recommendation's y'all have. Feel free to go full lecture mode, i enjoy learning new things and expanding on what i already know.\n\n",

As per the logs there is no temperature hotspots, I have also repasted CPU, cleaned fans and even repasted the GPU.\n\nSome additional observations :\n\n* The issue tends to happen during AAA Gaming. I completed Silksong and Hades 2, and didn't face a single crash.\n* The issue also tends to resolve itself for a month or two, and there is no crash at all.\n* When the issue does show up, it is consistent. Post a crash restart, I can boot into the game and it will crash after minutes (even during non trivial screens like level up menu)\n* Keeping the PC off for a day or two, alleviates the issue for a little bit. This is could be just incidental or wrong observation.\n\nMy best guess is it is due to the power draw, though not sure how to check that in HWInfo. I believe the issue might have started after upgrading from 5600X to 5900X. Though its hard to be sure, and I don't believe my setup should exceed the 750w Draw during gaming.\n\nThe other might be related to static build up, but again it should also cause crash during idle. My PC tends to be on 24x7 for Jellyfin and laziness, so it should have been noticed then.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated, since this has driven me insane over the past year.",

However, both the manufacturer‚Äôs documentation and several user reports suggest that switching to an intake setup tends to yield better thermals due to increased static pressure and direct access to cooler ambient air.\n\nAdditionally, the case currently has two exhaust fans at the rear and three intake fans at the bottom.\n\nIf I reverse the side fans to intake through the radiator, what kind of temperature delta should I realistically expect (CPU/GPU or coolant-wise)? For reference, I also have an additional set of reverse-flow fans available if a push-pull configuration would be beneficial.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, my pc's vrm is overheating like crazy (100 degrees) and is throttling my cpu and gpu. This happened a few days after installing new case fans and a tower cooler for the cpu (previously used the amd wraith cooler). My specs are:   \nRyzen 7 5700x  \nGTX 1660 super  \n16 gb DDR4 2666 mhz  \nBIOSTAR Group B550MX/E PRO  \nCPU cooler: JIUSHARK JF100 RS  \nCase: InPlay Meteor 03 \n\nWhen stress testing using cpu-z, the cpu temperature is at max 73 degrees celsius. When gaming, both cpu and gpu are at a max of 70 degrees celsius under heavy load. But the whole pc stutters and fps drops every once in a while. HWinfo motherboard temperature 2 displays 100 degrees celsius during these stutters. The temperature 2 is also at 75-80 degrees celsius idle. \n\nI tried everything. Using the top 2 fans as exhaust worsened the vrm temps (reaches 100 degrees in less than 3 minutes of cpu-z stress test) but when I put the 2 top fans as intake it reaches 95\\~98 degrees in around 8 minutes, but still throttles after. I also undervolted the cpu in the bios pbo (-10 curve) and still no luck. I didn't mention this but I have 3 intake fans in the front, and 1 exhaust in the rear. The top fans are intake for now since putting them in exhaust heats the vrm very fast. I'm thinking of just either buying a new motherboard or replacing the vrm heatsinks.   \n  \nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.",

I was having to cap it at 60fps and super low graphics and even then it would crash. So I thought it was my ram. I went into my bios and turned off Xmp. After I did that and saved it tried to boot and it froze and first gave me the acpi error. Then I went to sleep and tried it again then it was the kernel error. Then the memory error. I was just going to get a new motherboard and ram stick pair. Probably gonna try out 6000 cl30 but if anyone knows a fix or has ran into this issue before I‚Äôd love some help thank you!",

As you can see i have these weird red lines moving over my screen in periodic waves. Weirdly this always just happens to ONE of the two monitors. Depending on which of them is plugged in to the right. Im using the rtx 3060 ti from Kfa2 and have 3dp and 1 hmdi and ive been testing all of them with different cables but always ONE of them has the lines. Now it gets to the even weirder part: When i open the OS Menu they do not appear on it AND when im playing demanding games f.e. RDR2 they dissapear until i close the game, also sometimes when i start sharing screen on discord they disappear too. In my opinion it has to do with the power from the gpu right? does it not have enough power for two monitors? bcs 1 always runs perfect in all different ports (dp 1-3, hdmi). \nPS: I also did a DDU and thought i fixed it but it reappeared after a few seconds...\nAny help would be greatly appreciated this has been driving me crazzyyy\n",

Of course I powered off the PC before install. Powered on and installed o.g. Rx 580 driver then got the driver failed to load about 1/3rd of the way through the install. Even doing a safe boot and ddu the drivers again when it powers up with the rx580 installed I still get no output from it and the wddm windows driver says its working. Power cable from PSU to the RX 580 has the blue light on at all times when the PC is powered up. \n\n At this point I'm a bit confused at what is the issue with this card. The guy I bought it from said it worked in his build and as far as he knows was never used as a mining card. And to look at it, it's cleaner than my dinner plate while looking like it just came out of a new box.\n\nCan you fine folk give me any insight into how I can possibly get this to work?\n                              ",

    "selftext": "So I have basically a complete PC lying around (minus GPU) and I was thinking about putting everything together. It's one of the Chinese X99 knockoffs and while I have a low end Xeon, I also have a pretty high TDP one that I'd like to use. I know the VRMs are notoriously bomb like on these and I have an idea to remedy this, but I'm not sure if my idea is evil genius or court jester.\n\nThe case will not have enough room for a traditional water cooling system (tank, pump separate, all that jazz) so my thought was to buy a cheap AIO and hack in an extra water loop for the VRM. The VRM cooler would be an aluminum manifold block sitting on top of the VRM with putty or thermal glue, and I would just route the water through there before the CPU or after, whichever would work plumbing wise easier.\n\nI suppose if I go this route finding an AIO with a drain would be ideal, otherwise it would be practically impossible to do this without losing coolant and no real way to top it back off.\n\nSo, tear in, remind me of shit I have neglected to think of. As for why? It's just something to do and I hate having PC parts lying around because they become PCs, it's like having spare AR parts when you like guns, they always breed another.",

    "selftext": "**In 2021 Valve introduced precompiled shader delivery system on SteamOS**. A lot of Steam Deck users liked this feature. It even give some performance advantage in games on Steam Deck compared to the same games launched on Windows. Unfortunately Valve never decided to release this feature to Windows users but there is a hope.\n\nA month ago MS revealed that Windows 11 2025 H2 support ['Advanced Shader Delivery' ](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/introducing-advanced-shader-delivery/)which is basically a copy of system used by Steam Deck on Steam OS. Currently it is used only on games from MS Store (Game Pass) on ROG Ally Xbox (ROG Ally 2). I googled and tried to find any benchmarks, but there are none. Very few people have access to this device\n\nHow to test it?\n\n1. You need have ROG Ally Xbox\n2. You need own a single game available on both Steam and MS Store (PC Game Pass)\n3. Install the same game from both Steam and Game Pass. But do not launch it yet because we need a cold start\n4. Launch a ROG Ally 2 without any apps in background, especially Steam or Epic must be disabled because they are a 'desktop apps' so they load a lot of unnecessary dependencies. Launch a game from Game Pass and do some benchmarks\n5. Launch a ROG Ally 2 again (restart) but this time only with Steam app launched. All other apps like Epic should be disabled so ROG will load to memory only a Steam app. Launch the same game as before but this time purchased from Steam.\n6. Compare results to check if 'precompiled shaders' makes a difference\n\nI‚Äôd love to run this test myself, but I don‚Äôt have a ROG Ally 2 and older devices don‚Äôt support the Advanced Shader Delivery system - at least for now. So I can‚Äôt test it on my ROG Ally 2023. But maybe someone who owns the new Ally 2 could run the test for me?\n\n**This is the first time PC users on Windows have access to 'precompiled shaders'. It could be an interesting to see if this makes any difference or not**",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm completely stuck with a problem that started the moment I upgraded my GPU, and I‚Äôm hoping someone here can see what I‚Äôm missing. I upgraded from an RX 580 to a Gigabyte RX 9060 XT, and ever since then my whole system has become stuttery ‚Äî not just in games, but even in Chrome and Windows. None of this happened before the upgrade.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nSymptoms\n\t‚Ä¢\tIn games (Apex, etc.):\n\t‚Ä¢\tCPU sits at 100%\n\t‚Ä¢\tGPU usage only 30‚Äì50%\n\t‚Ä¢\tLow FPS and heavy stutters\n\t‚Ä¢\tApex menu sometimes stuck at ~30 FPS\n\t‚Ä¢\tShaders rebuild more often than they should\n\t‚Ä¢\tEven outside gaming:\n\t‚Ä¢\tChrome tabs can send CPU to 100%\n\t‚Ä¢\tWindows feels ‚Äúmicro-stuttery‚Äù and slower than before\n\t‚Ä¢\tTemps are fine (both around ~60¬∞C)\n\t‚Ä¢\tThis did NOT happen with the RX 580\n\nThis doesn‚Äôt feel like a normal ‚ÄúCPU bottleneck.‚Äù If it were, Windows and Chrome wouldn‚Äôt be choking, and the system wouldn‚Äôt feel worse with a better GPU.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nMy specs\n\t‚Ä¢\tCPU: Ryzen 5 3500X\n\t‚Ä¢\tGPU: Gigabyte RX 9060 XT\n\t‚Ä¢\tMotherboard: ASRock B550M Pro4\n\t‚Ä¢\tRAM: 16GB (2√ó8GB) DDR4 @ 3200MHz\n\t‚Ä¢\tPSU: Seasonic S12III 500W\n\t‚Ä¢\tMonitor: 1440p 165/180Hz\n\n‚∏ª\n\nThings I have already tried\n\t‚Ä¢\tClean driver reinstall with DDU in Safe Mode (internet unplugged + AMD factory reset)\n\t‚Ä¢\tBIOS settings checked:\n\t‚Ä¢\tCSM disabled\n\t‚Ä¢\tAbove 4G decoding enabled\n\t‚Ä¢\tResizable BAR enabled\n\t‚Ä¢\tReinstalled shader cache\n\t‚Ä¢\tVerified game files\n\t‚Ä¢\tRAM XMP enabled (3200MHz confirmed)\n\t‚Ä¢\tNo overclocking\n\t‚Ä¢\tTemps good\n\t‚Ä¢\tFresh AMD software settings (no overlays, no V-Sync issues, no FMF enabled)\n\n‚∏ª\n\nWhy I‚Äôm confused\n\nMy old RX 580 was weaker, but everything was smooth ‚Äî in games and in Windows. After the upgrade, the system feels worse overall, which makes me think something is wrong at a deeper level (driver issue, BIOS quirk, PSU? CPU scheduling?).\n\n‚∏ª\n\nWhat I want to know\n\t‚Ä¢\tCould a PSU or BIOS issue cause this behavior?\n\t‚Ä¢\tIs there something AMD-specific I might‚Äôve overlooked when switching GPUs?\n\t‚Ä¢\tHas anyone seen a GPU upgrade cause system-wide stutter, not just gaming issues?\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny advanced troubleshooting steps I should try next?\n\nI‚Äôm open to trying anything. Any ideas are appreciated, because I‚Äôm out of things to test at this point.\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hey so ive been googling and searching but couldnt find anything about this...Im using two monitors, both 144hz, but one 1440p and the other 1080p. As you can see i have these weird red lines moving over my screen in periodic waves. Weirdly this always just happens to ONE of the two monitors. Depending on which of them is plugged in to the right. Im using the rtx 3060 ti from Kfa2 and have 3dp and 1 hmdi and ive been testing all of them with different cables but always ONE of them has the lines. Now it gets to the even weirder part: When i open the OS Menu they do not appear on it AND when im playing demanding games f.e. RDR2 they dissapear until i close the game, also sometimes when i start sharing screen on discord they disappear too. In my opinion it has to do with the power from the gpu right? does it not have enough power for two monitors? bcs 1 always runs perfect in all different ports (dp 1-3, hdmi). \nPS: I also did a DDU and thought i fixed it but it reappeared after a few seconds...\nAny help would be greatly appreciated this has been driving me crazzyyy\n",

I am now sure about most of the components apart from the motherboard and the cooling system.\n\n\n\nFor the cooling system I choose a Thermalright Assassin spirit 120 evo dark for 23 ‚Ç¨. I'll buy a ryzen 5 9600x with a radeon 9060 xt and I'm not sure if the cooling system is enough. Should i buy something \"stronger\"?.\n\n\n\nFor the motherboard I decided for a Gigabyte B850 eagle wifi6e for 181 ‚Ç¨. My questions are: is it a good motherboard? Should i spend some more for a better one? There are also the ASRock one, that are less pricey where I live, but I'm afraid of that whole frying CPU thing. I know that there were some problems with the 9000 3XD and not the 9000x but i would rather not risk my cpu.\n\n\n\nAdding some more details: I'm italian. My build now cost more or less 1100 ‚Ç¨ and I would like to remain near the 1000. I'll use the computer for gaming and studying and I would like to arrive at 1440 p.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for everyone who will respond and good day.",

Ive finally hit a point which id like to play bigger games for youtube.  \n\n\nMy research has come to something like a 5070 (if it fits) or 9800 xtx (which i know little about other than it might be a better card?).  The more vram the better, but id rather not blow the bank, otherwise id rather just save and suffer for a few more years get a full new build (this time one i build myself, if i have a job that give me enough time and money to do so). \n\nThese are my main questions:\n\nWhat would be the best gpu to upgrade to from a 4060 on a r16 alienware? (Any brand as long as its compatible)  \nWhat would fit? (maximum length of 312mm i believe)  \nBest power supply to go with it?  \nWhat wont be too bottlenecked by my i7-14700f CPU?

Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything‚Äôs dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

    "selftext": "**Please ignore the cables and mess, that is currently in progress to be fixed.**  \n  \nI‚Äôm trying to add a 4th display under my main monitor. All three of my current monitors are wall-mounted, so there‚Äôs about an 8.5-inch vertical gap between the desk and the bottom edge of the middle screen. I‚Äôd like to fill that space with a small monitor that can tilt upward toward me, something around 15 inches smaller or larger is fine if it fits nicely.\n\nI work two remote jobs. My main desktop runs my primary job, and my company laptop handles a second, lighter role where I mostly respond to messages and manage a small team. Both setups really benefit from having two screens. I plan to use a KVM switch to share my keyboard/mouse and possibly one or two monitors between the systems, but I‚Äôd like a dedicated screen underneath the middle monitor for quick multitasking.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Fits within an 8.5-inch gap under my center monitor\n* Can tilt upward (20‚Äì35¬∞ ideally)\n* Doesn‚Äôt need to be fancy ‚Äî 1080p is fine\n* Ideally plug-and-play (HDMI or USB-C)\n* Clean look that blends well with my setup\n\nI‚Äôve looked into stretch bar displays, which would look amazing, but most are expensive or complicated to set up. So I‚Äôm leaning toward a portable monitor as a practical option for now. I just want to see if anyone has found a budget-friendly tilted display that fits under a main monitor like this.",

Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything‚Äôs dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to ‚Äúdynamat‚Äù which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I‚Äôve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that‚Äôs ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn‚Äôt hard with the tool they provide. I‚Äôve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It‚Äôs the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn‚Äôt know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won‚Äôt be my daily driver but it‚Äôs a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI‚Äôll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": "I answered a question in the sticker, but I find that this info may be useful for someone else so I'll just leave it here for reference.  \nI took me around 5 years to find a viable option for the keyboard I wanted. My main problem is that I wanted to join 3 things that are rare to see together: A fullsize (no 96%) Corsair K70 like keyboard with hotswap and a volume knob.\n\nHere is the answer after around 5 years looking for it. Hope it helps someone. üôÇ  \nIf I forget something, please comment below.\n\n**If you want all these 3 things:**\n\nFirst there's the new ND104 (to be realeased soon):\n\n[https://chilkey.com/pages/nd104-coming-soon](https://chilkey.com/pages/nd104-coming-soon)\n\n2nd There's Aula TH108, F108 and F108 pro.

It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper. \n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I just about had it after about 10 keys with the problem. I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone but I am just about fed up with reliability issues and GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust that 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at odd locaiton. What other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

    "title": "HMX Firecracker has tickled a weird part of my brain and I may never recover: a review.",
    "selftext": "First and foremost - I'm a tactile switch lover through and through. I've tried a fair number this year, the most recent being the Sillyworks x Gateron Type R. I've tried both more budget options (I see you Akko V3 Cream Blue Pro!) and more premium offerings like the Drop x Invyr Holy Pandas. I've spent too much money but honestly I no longer care because I may have found IT. The one. Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

Not usually a place to go for cheap vintage things as they generally know what's good and price accordingly.  For instance this was right next to a Model M keyboard for $150 which I felt was a little over priced.  Now obviously this will take some work to make it usable.  There are broken rivets so it will need a bolt mod in addition to building a case of some sorts and something to connect to the membrane cables to wire up to a controller.  But the keycaps are very cool and split a spacebar... heck yeah.  For now, it'll sit in the collection as I have a long list of projects to work on.  But someday, this thing will rock again.",

I like hiding a fun 60% build in the 5th slot personally :)\n\nKeyboard Protection:\nStands are stable, support 15 lbs per shelf and have been thoroughly strength tested. Cork pads and silicone bumpers are built into each shelf to ensure boards are fully protected and prevent slippage. The bottom of the stand is also equipped with silicone pads to ensure the stand itself doesn't slide around.\n\nUSB Dongle/Flash Drive Storage:\nOffers USB dongle storage for storing and keeping track of wireless dongles as well as flash drives (28 slots total). Note these are not powered or connected, they are purely for storage. No more mixing up or losing your wireless dongles!\n\nPegboard Slots:\nThe back of the stand is equipped with skadis slots for various purposes. The stands are compatible with a variety of skadis accessories and hooks. There are also two slots on each side of the stand for a side hook/accessory. Be on the lookout for skadis accessories to start showing up on the Clackify store as well!\n\n14 Color Options:\nThere are a variety of color options ranging from simple colors to translucent and even Galaxy (sort of metallic) options.\n\nCustomizations:\nIf you'd like to have anything customized, don't hesitate to reach out! Other colors would be possible, and design tweaks could potentially be made for a small fee. Adding logos is also a possibility.\n\nFree US Shipping:\nKeyboard Stands (and any orders over $75 for that matter) ship free to locations in the US.\n\nMore information and photos can be found here: https://clackify.com/products/clackify-keyboard-stand-4-tier\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!

    "selftext": "I have built/modded several premium boards, but regardless of that fact,  I picked up a used Ducky One Mini. I had seen a video by Alex Otos, praising his 60% Ducky budget keyboard. He said it was his go-to for gaming. Therefore I decided to pick one up and guess what? I love it. I can‚Äôt really explain it, but it just feels good to type on. It has a quiet sound profile (which I typically hate), and has a pretty minimalist vibe to it.\n\nWhen I first bought it (used off of eBay), I immediately regretted it because I felt I overpaid for it after I foolishly looked around and found some for half the price. As soon as I got it, I tried to swap out keycaps and those freakin‚Äô inductive switches came out with every single keycap! I soon realized the used budget keycap set I had grabbed (off of eBay, as well) were way too tight. I had to fight every single switch to get it out of the keycap I had pulled off (when I decided I didn‚Äôt like them and chose to go back to the original keycaps). They were so hard to detach from the keycaps, my hands were killing me. I finally resorted to a rubber jar gripper that made the job a little easier as I got down to the last few keycaps.\n\nThe inductive switches came out crazy easy and I was not happy about that. However, when I got it back together again and just chose a few colorful keycaps for some modifier keys, I liked the simple look of it (and I will never again swap out the keycaps!) My hands literally ached the entire next day. \n\nHowever, after using it for a few days, I was hooked!  You have got feel it to understand it.\n\nLayout: 60%\nConnectivity: Tri-mode\nCase: ABS\nMount Style: Gasket-mount\nPlate material: SPCC Steel\nSwitches: Ducky Inductive Switches-linear, 3.5 mm total travel, 40g initial force\nDampening Design: Ducky QUACK Mechanics+ with 7-layer dampening\nKeycaps: Ducky 85% high-purity PBT Double-shot PBT\nStabalizers: Ducky Plate-Mounted\nHot-Swappable: Yes\nReport Rate: 1000 Hz\nSoftware: Web-based \nModifier Keycaps - Double-shot PBT (Ali Express)\n\n",

And I love it! I got all parts and built it nearly two days ago.\n\nI had no experience on mechanical keyboards (unless we count typing some Red Dragon keyboard I found in some store for one second), so I was gambling how the switches should behave. And I really like what I chose... I don't want to say I hit the jackpot yet, still a very new keyboard.\n\nThe keycaps have an uneven height... You can see on the function keys on the middle. But so far, not an actual issue when using my keyboard. And they're like soft on the touch, I really like that. I really liked the look of the MOA profile, and I think they're comfortable in general, especially when playing Tetris - my fingers sit on them seemingly flawlessly.\n\nNot on the sound test video but basically the numpad has a clacky sound in addition. Not (very) loud, especially how I'll almost only use it on Blender, pressing one specific key before I move back to the other keyboard or my mouse.\n\nInserting the keycaps on slot with stabalizers... For the stubborn ones (the enter key being the worst offender) - and I'll admit I don't know if it even actually worked or I was just lucky (I was past at my sleep schedule at that point lmao), I was raising and centering the cross thingies, then have the respective keyboard upside down with my hand (or arm, 1kg keyboard lmao), and insert they keycap in. I had to do all that process more than once with a couple of keycaps, but I did manage to make sure the stabalizers actually do their job.\n\nI have two PCs (a tower, and a tiny Single Board Computer), so the wireless features on both keyboards are reeeeally comfortable for me. I don't mind the keyboard's weight when I have to take out my graphics tablet, my desk is big enough to move around everything I need.",

    "selftext": "Not sure if this is the right place, but it certainly seems all things keyswitches!\n\nI've got some harvested MX style keyswitches, that I'm hoping to use to build a macropad (model pictured! Its based around an ESP32 CYD display, with a rotary encoder knob). Ideally I don't want to print up a board for this, and would really just like to have flying leads to my IO breakout. \n\nI'm really struggling to get leads to stick to the pins without them oxidising, melting... If it were a few switches I could just about do it, but getting 12 to stick is becoming challenging, and I fear for the longevity of it.\n\nChatGPT seemed to suggest there were keyswitches available with flying leads in place, but I have a strong suspicion its hallucinating given I can't find a single one. Getting a PCB printed is going to be expensive (and I'm already into the too much time / money sunk on random bits stage).\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas or experience in how to reliably connect to the switches? I was hoping I could crimp Dupont style connectors to them, but it seems risky (large moment of force on the thin legs) and theres not much vertical space.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4djk5f1j7avf1.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=d690575f4cfb23c6db93e1b3879d37c69b689d97\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "title": "Overhauled Lemokey L3",
    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to ‚Äúdynamat‚Äù which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I‚Äôve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that‚Äôs ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn‚Äôt hard with the tool they provide. I‚Äôve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It‚Äôs the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn‚Äôt know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won‚Äôt be my daily driver but it‚Äôs a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI‚Äôll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "title": "Overhauled Lemokey L3",
    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to ‚Äúdynamat‚Äù which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I‚Äôve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that‚Äôs ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn‚Äôt hard with the tool they provide. I‚Äôve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It‚Äôs the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn‚Äôt know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won‚Äôt be my daily driver but it‚Äôs a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI‚Äôll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .¬† everything went smoothly;¬† no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.¬† It‚Äôs probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and ‚Äúhow to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers‚Äù videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).¬† Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote¬† - without needing to look at any references during the build. ¬†\n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced ‚Äî just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;¬† make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;¬† checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn‚Äî->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys). ¬†\n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:¬† prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it‚Äôs too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you‚Äôre probably excited to complete quickly.¬† The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta‚Äô get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**¬† if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n¬†¬† **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;¬† $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;¬† unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.¬† (I‚Äôm liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n¬†",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "title": "Small review of TCL 25G464 with images",
    "selftext": "Hi, I recently bought this monitor and I'm literally so happy with it that I just wanted to write a quick review in order to help anybody in doubt who doesn't know if this would be a good choice. I come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). A few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for ‚Ç¨170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for ‚Ç¨199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. First, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium. I didn't like standard local dimming because it isn't bright at all. Blooming exists: if you put LD to High you can notice it, if you put it to Medium you notice it less. I have to say it doesn't give me a single problem and it's very soft and hard to notice to the eye. My perfect settings are: FreeSync ON obviously, response time Fast, LD Medium, brightness 60 (depends on the light in your room basically), contrast 50 (default, don't touch it), sharpness 5 (default), gamma 1 (but I changed it slightly with Windows to match my preference), colors at \"Standard\", color temperature \"User 50/50/50\", color space \"Original\". With those settings the monitor gives me an experience very very close to the OLED one I had one year ago: by words I can say the image is vivid just the same. The differences, if you're interested in OLED too, are: different response times (OLED has literally virtually 0 and you clearly notice it, on TCL it's very good though), infinite contrast compared to not-infinite contrast (but as you can see from the images I added the blacks are amazing and the images are very vivid), the main difference you can obviously notice are the viewing angles: the ones on OLED are completely perfect while the ones on TCL are very good but if you watch the monitor from the side you can clearly see the glow. On that point I want to firmly say that if you use the monitor correctly from the front you won't have a problem with viewing angles (I returned 2 monitors for that issue, so you can trust me). The cons that I found are: no 10-bit at 300Hz as it only works on 240Hz, so you have to go 300Hz 8-bit (but I can't notice a difference anyway so it's not a problem for me); I don't like the fact that, unlike my old LG monitor, you can't turn off the joystick light (the one you use to access the monitor's menu) so at night it will switch from a static light blue to a static yellow (I repeat it's not a problem since the light is soft enough, but if you could have turned it off it would have been amazing). Lastly, I tested and didn't like the HDR as it delivers an image that is somehow washed out in my opinion, but I never used it and will never use it anyway so all good for me. If I had to rate the monitor I would give it a 10 out of 10, considering the fact that I touched with my hands and tested an OLED one and other recent IPS models. It just works like an OLED with some minor caveats (but if you, like me, love the 24\" FHD combo, this is mandatory) and for a fraction of the price. Speaking of price, to me it should be much higher than what it is right now, so if you are wondering if you should buy it, I definitely suggest you to do so! For any questions related to it feel free to ask; I'll leave some images of it just to let you see how nice the picture quality is!

    "title": "Small review of TCL 25G64",
    "selftext": "Hi, I recently bought this monitor and I'm literally so happy with it that I just wanted to write a quick review in order to help anybody in doubt who doesn't know if this would be a good choice. I come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). A few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for ‚Ç¨170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for ‚Ç¨199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. First, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium.

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI am in a unique position where I can get a monitor through my company for a considerably reduced price, as they are funding ¬£500 / $670 towards it. The question is, which monitor should I go for here, or should I keep my own?\n\nThe first option that I currently own is a Samsung Odyssey 1440p 144Hz 32‚Ä≥ QHD, while its nice, its a bit big for my desk and does look a little silly. Also I am concerned about Pixel density and if I am really getting the best image quality.\n\nThe second option is the Dell UltraSharp 27‚Ä≥ QHD 120 Hz. This would have less refresh rate compared to the Samsung one, but I'm wondering if it would give a better picture as the pixel density is higher. This would be ¬£390/$520. Making it free.\n\nThe third option is the more expensive Sony INZONE M10S (27‚Ä≥) OLED 1440p 480Hz monitor, which would be a significant upgrade but prices in around $1717.97 / ¬£1270, but essentially has a price of ¬£770/$1030.\n\nI am torn between either keeping my Samsung, or going for the Dell or Sony one. If I do go for the Sony one I'd be paying ¬£770/$1030 out of of pocket, but would end up with a better/ future proofed monitor. At that price point would it be obvious to get it?\n\nUsually I sit around an arms length away, I do a mix of gaming/productivity work.\n\nAny advice would be good.",

That being said local dimming makes all the difference and contrast looks good for a IPS panel, I believe.

There is blooming, of course, but that's minimal for me. Glad surprise imho, far from an OLED I'm afraid, yet not all bad. I'm happy with it",

What I find strange is that when I enable HDR in games (god of war Ragnarok, ratched and clank rift apart, the last of us part 1 and so on) colors get really saturated. They get saturated as if I was playing in SDR on the wide gamut monitor without clamping it to sRGB. It only happens in games, because Netflix, YouTube HDR have the right colors and even the desktop in HDR is fine, apart the higher brightness. Is it normal that games have so much more saturated colors or is windows doing something bad?\n\nBefore you ask me, monitor set in 4k full RGB 10 bits, windows HDR calibration tool used, windows ACM enabled to clamp in SDR.\n\n[HDR in png](https://preview.redd.it/6jgh6nhwu9wf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f90464586229a105181c4918b3c072f5f766c42)\n\n[SDR in png](https://preview.redd.it/zn9e7s2zu9wf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4deb72df4bb45becbc49cf59303be037365e1cc)\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n  \nI'm hoping some of you may have some insight between the screens on these laptops, Lenovo T450 with panel N140bge-ea3 (1366x768) compared to Lenovo T470 with panel N140HCA-EAB (1080p), and what may be the cause of the additional eye strain.\n\nSince I switched to the T470 recently I've started experiencing significant eye strain. Previously I could use the T450 pretty much all day without any discomfort, but now after using the T470 for just a few hours my eyes hurt like crazy along with a massive headache. This is regardless of screen brightness. I've also disabled anything in Intel graphics control panel like noise reduction, color enhancement, etc. that might be messing with things. I've used plenty of other 1080p or 4k devices for prolonged periods so I don't believe the resolution is related.\n\nI've compared the panels on panelook (https://www.panelook.com/modelcompare.php?ids=17574,30063) and I see they have different PWM frequencies and duty cycles, but I don't know enough about monitors/panels to know for sure if this could be the culprit or if something else is more likely. \n\nThe T470 / N140HCA-EAB has a duty cycle of 1\\~100%, and a PWM frequency of 100(min) \\~ 500(Max) Hz, while the T450 / N140bge-ea3 has a duty cycle 5\\~100% and PWM frequency of 190 (min) \\~ 2K(Max) Hz. There are also some other differences like slightly higher nits and contrast ratio.\n\nI'd like to replace the panel with something that's 1080p still but doesn't hurt my eyes so much. In the meantime I've been using F.lux aggressively and that seems to help some, although I never needed it on the old laptop. I would greatly appreciate any insight or experiences you might have.",

    "title": "OLED or MINI LED IPS?",
    "selftext": "Hi, I am currently deciding on a new monitor. I currently have a 27inch, 1440p, 95hz 350nit brightness IPS. My hardware driving it is an an XBOX series X, occasional mid laptop and a PC with a 7800x3d and a rx 7900 xtx. I am also based in the UK.\n\nI am looking for a new monitor (with the existing becoming a secondary portrait), that is 32 inch (so I can sit further back and push it deeper on my desk and ultimately for a more cinematic experience). I am gonna go for a 4k panel for an increase in pixel density (especially in the case of OLEDs odd text clarity).\n\nRefresh rate I am a bit blas√© about, anything 120hz and above is fine, obviously higher is better.\n\nFor IO HDMI 2.1 is required and ideally id like DP2.1 UBHR 13.5 and higher (Unless someone can make a really good case for something out that is otherwise good), assuming the refresh rate goes much over 120hz. Also USB C with alt mode and atleast 65w charging (not that pitiful shite like 15w).\n\nBudget max of like ¬£1000 but less is ideal. Usage case is like 70% gaming/content 30% working changing at some sections of the to 95% gaming and content and 5% work.\n\nThe choice in my mind really comes down to QD OLED or IPS Mini LED, OLED has superior uniformity, contrast, viewing angles and motion handing; where as Mini LED has brightness.\n\nMy sticking point is that my existing IPS is quite bright and getting a dimmer OLED my look disappointing as well as not particularly bright HDR performance. But Mini LED IPS has blooming, poorer motion handing, uniformity, possible light bleed (big turn off but should be negated by local dimming although it could be an issue). Also aesthetically OLED's look nicer. My environment also changes some what, sometimes I am using my set up in the middle if the day, so bright room, especially come summer, not too good for glossy QD OLEDs, but at the same time I play in the dark for a while where QD OLED is in its element, and then some times with a lamp on which I am unsure as to how QD will look then, either way I could encounter reflections or black raise.\n\nFor some context I am looking at the gigabyte aorus 31.5\" fo32u2p and the benq mobiuz ex321ux. The OLED is cheaper, another of my criticisms with the Mini LED is its high pricing for what it is. I am aware of the Samsung neo G8 but with it being a VA panel with piss poor viewing angles I am not particularly interested.\n\nI have also looked at WOLED's but they have worse text clarity in comparison to both IPS and QD OLED and most seem to be DP 1.4 and matt (I prefer the idea of glossy for the clarity).\n\nI am aware of newer brighter panels for OLED but they seem to be constrained to 27 inch panels, I am sure theyt will come out but they will probably be 8 months off and I can't really be bother; if OLED was SDR 300nits and HDR true black 500, the choice would be vastly easier.

First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ‚Üî 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2√ó HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters. [P2712V Link](https://bit.ly/4gmDFse)\n\n**P275MV Plus (Mini-LED with DyDs)**\n\n* Same **4K/160 ‚Üî 1080p/320** dual mode\n* **Mini-LED FALD (1152 zones), HDR1000**\n* **What is DyDs**: the backlight is driven in sync with the panel update to keep motion clean **with local dimming on** and to improve visibility in dark scenes (less smearing/black crush than typical FALD IPS). [P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe‚Äôre currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

That being said local dimming makes all the difference and contrast looks good for a IPS panel, I believe. Also my first time using a high refresh monitor, 300hz are really welcome even if it's not the fastest nor more responsive IPS in the word. \n\nModel is TCL 25g64, only 180 zones, but helps a lot diminishing the glowing. There is blooming, of course, but that's minimal for me. Glad surprise imho, far from an OLED I'm afraid, yet not all bad. I'm happy with it",

    "title": "Small review of TCL 25G464 with images",
    "selftext": "Hi, I recently bought this monitor and I'm literally so happy with it that I just wanted to write a quick review in order to help anybody in doubt who doesn't know if this would be a good choice. I come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). A few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for ‚Ç¨170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for ‚Ç¨199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. First, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium. I didn't like standard local dimming because it isn't bright at all. Blooming exists: if you put LD to High you can notice it, if you put it to Medium you notice it less. I have to say it doesn't give me a single problem and it's very soft and hard to notice to the eye. My perfect settings are: FreeSync ON obviously, response time Fast, LD Medium, brightness 60 (depends on the light in your room basically), contrast 50 (default, don't touch it), sharpness 5 (default), gamma 1 (but I changed it slightly with Windows to match my preference), colors at \"Standard\", color temperature \"User 50/50/50\", color space \"Original\". With those settings the monitor gives me an experience very very close to the OLED one I had one year ago: by words I can say the image is vivid just the same. The differences, if you're interested in OLED too, are: different response times (OLED has literally virtually 0 and you clearly notice it, on TCL it's very good though), infinite contrast compared to not-infinite contrast (but as you can see from the images I added the blacks are amazing and the images are very vivid), the main difference you can obviously notice are the viewing angles: the ones on OLED are completely perfect while the ones on TCL are very good but if you watch the monitor from the side you can clearly see the glow. On that point I want to firmly say that if you use the monitor correctly from the front you won't have a problem with viewing angles (I returned 2 monitors for that issue, so you can trust me). The cons that I found are: no 10-bit at 300Hz as it only works on 240Hz, so you have to go 300Hz 8-bit (but I can't notice a difference anyway so it's not a problem for me); I don't like the fact that, unlike my old LG monitor, you can't turn off the joystick light (the one you use to access the monitor's menu) so at night it will switch from a static light blue to a static yellow (I repeat it's not a problem since the light is soft enough, but if you could have turned it off it would have been amazing). Lastly, I tested and didn't like the HDR as it delivers an image that is somehow washed out in my opinion, but I never used it and will never use it anyway so all good for me. If I had to rate the monitor I would give it a 10 out of 10, considering the fact that I touched with my hands and tested an OLED one and other recent IPS models. It just works like an OLED with some minor caveats (but if you, like me, love the 24\" FHD combo, this is mandatory) and for a fraction of the price. Speaking of price, to me it should be much higher than what it is right now, so if you are wondering if you should buy it, I definitely suggest you to do so! For any questions related to it feel free to ask; I'll leave some images of it just to let you see how nice the picture quality is!

The monitor I wanted (but couldn't afford at the time) is the Dell G3223Q 4K 144Hz.\n\nNow I have saved up the money to buy it. I have read here and on rtings and the opinions are somewhat divided but I have seen many who are happy with it. I want to use the Dell as my main monitor and the Odyssey as a second monitor placed above the Dell. What do you say, should I wait? Do you have another better alternative? P.S. I want IPS because I am afraid of burn in and everything that is not IPS tires my eyes.\n\nAlso, do you think there will be a noticeable difference between 180Hz and 144Hz? I should mention that I don't play games at the moment, maybe in the future if I have time. So gaming is not a priority.\n\nThanks\n\nLE: another option in that price range would be LG UltraGear‚Ñ¢ 32G810SA-W",

I game on PS5 and previously had an ASUS TUF VG28UQL1A.\n\n(I am not opposed to other monitors at all, but it seems based on all my preferences I have narrowed it down to these two and the prices are decent at the moment. Also I am based in Ireland if that is important) \n\nWhat do we think? Thanks in advance to everyone who takes the time to offer advice/discuss this! :)",

I mostly do 3D modeling, so I spend 10+ hours per day in the software,plus some gaming.\n\nIs it worth getting OLED, or will it inevitably burn in even if I follow the precautions?\n\nI was looking at the RedMagic monitor with 2000+ dimming zones, but it's never available in Europe, so that's a minus.\n\nI have no idea what to pick, and I'm worried I'll regret getting OLED.\n\nI previously had an ASUS ROG Strix Scar 18 with, an 18-inch screen and 2000+ dimming zones, which is roughly equivalent to~4500+ zones on a 27-inch monitor. In HDR mode, the blacks were truly black, which looked amazing, but I don't think I'll find anything similar in desktop monitors.\n\nMaybe you know some good Mini LED options?",

I come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). A few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for ‚Ç¨170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for ‚Ç¨199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. First, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium. I didn't like standard local dimming because it isn't bright at all. Blooming exists: if you put LD to High you can notice it, if you put it to Medium you notice it less. I have to say it doesn't give me a single problem and it's very soft and hard to notice to the eye. My perfect settings are: FreeSync ON obviously, response time Fast, LD Medium, brightness 60 (depends on the light in your room basically), contrast 50 (default, don't touch it), sharpness 5 (default), gamma 1 (but I changed it slightly with Windows to match my preference), colors at \"Standard\", color temperature \"User 50/50/50\", color space \"Original\". With those settings the monitor gives me an experience very very close to the OLED one I had one year ago: by words I can say the image is vivid just the same. The differences, if you're interested in OLED too, are: different response times (OLED has literally virtually 0 and you clearly notice it, on TCL it's very good though), infinite contrast compared to not-infinite contrast (but as you can see from the images I added the blacks are amazing and the images are very vivid), the main difference you can obviously notice are the viewing angles: the ones on OLED are completely perfect while the ones on TCL are very good but if you watch the monitor from the side you can clearly see the glow. On that point I want to firmly say that if you use the monitor correctly from the front you won't have a problem with viewing angles (I returned 2 monitors for that issue, so you can trust me). The cons that I found are: no 10-bit at 300Hz as it only works on 240Hz, so you have to go 300Hz 8-bit (but I can't notice a difference anyway so it's not a problem for me); I don't like the fact that, unlike my old LG monitor, you can't turn off the joystick light (the one you use to access the monitor's menu) so at night it will switch from a static light blue to a static yellow (I repeat it's not a problem since the light is soft enough, but if you could have turned it off it would have been amazing). Lastly, I tested and didn't like the HDR as it delivers an image that is somehow washed out in my opinion, but I never used it and will never use it anyway so all good for me. If I had to rate the monitor I would give it a 10 out of 10, considering the fact that I touched with my hands and tested an OLED one and other recent IPS models. It just works like an OLED with some minor caveats (but if you, like me, love the 24\" FHD combo, this is mandatory) and for a fraction of the price. Speaking of price, to me it should be much higher than what it is right now, so if you are wondering if you should buy it, I definitely suggest you to do so! For any questions related to it feel free to ask; I'll leave some images of it just to let you see how nice the picture quality is!

I want IPS because I am afraid of burn in and everything that is not IPS tires my eyes.\n\nAlso, do you think there will be a noticeable difference between 180Hz and 144Hz?

    "selftext": "I ordered a Maxwell just to try to see how it is. I wanted to compare to other closed backs and planars I've heard. I thought maybe it would be nice to have a set I can use from my couch if I want to play my PC games on the TV instead of my monitors.\n\nFor reference, some of the headphones I have are the 6xx, Aeon Closed RT, and Aeolus. I had a ton more in the past but those are the ones I kept.\n\nAnyway, the Maxwell came today. I purchased them new from Amazon. The seal was broken on the box, not sure what that was about.\n\nOverall, they somehow feel well built and fragile at the same time. I don't particularly like how they sit on my head. They feel heavy which in itself is not a big deal but they feel unbalanced.\n\nThey sound good for a wireless set, but they don't get loud enough IMO and I feel like I'm missing some details/separation. These could never replace something like the Aeon Closed RT + Dac/Amp for me.\n\nI'm going to send them back and get the Edition XV instead I think. I could see these working for some if you really need a wireless headset. But if you are just playing games at a desk or consuming media at a desk....wired headphones will always be the better option.",

    "selftext": "I'm potentially in the market for my first pair of earbuds and I had a few questions I was hoping y'all could help with. I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

    "selftext": "I can't use regular headphones because the lack of airflow starts to irritate my ear canals within minutes. I use bone conduction headphones when out of the house even though the sound quality is terrible, and when I'm inside I use speakers. I feel like if I had some earpads which were extremely breathable, ideally some kind of mesh which is hardly even there, that that would be best. I know I would be giving up some fidelity by doing that, and the sound leakage would mean I need to be discerning of where I wear them, but I think it would still be better than bone conduction.",

It's not like other sounds and instruments are fully drowned out but crisper videos or songs sound more bassy.

    "selftext": "So, I‚Äôve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn‚Äôt stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it‚Äôs no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they‚Äôd be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they‚Äôre better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they‚Äôre still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I‚Äôm really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an ‚Äúactive analog mode‚Äù which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you‚Äôre looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC‚Ä¶ look no further!",

    "selftext": "This is my project headphone for my high school design course.\n\nIt needed to fit the following criteria:\n\n* comfortable for long hours with ultralight weight construction\n* sound quality on par with other reference/studio headphones\n* priced relatively affordable compared to the market\n\n**specs:**\n\n* Driver: Peerless 50 mm driver\n* mass: 170g (without cable)\n* materials:\n   * earcups: PLA-LW and PLA\n   * headband strap: Faux leather\n   * earpad: aliexpress 110mm hybrid velour\n   * everything else: PETG\n* Connection: dual 3.5mm\n\n**Comfort**\n\nBeing 170 grams already makes this a comfortable headphone; it feels weightless on the head. Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

Well, they all sound horrible to me which plays into the logic I had about EQ prior to any of this.\n\nHow am I going to sound like a high end piece on a low end gear?\n\nTake the 990, say I wanted to try the HD800s profile, I autoEQ and apply it to the 990, wouldn't it sound like ass? Surely, the tech on a $1500 headphones is what makes the tuning shine right? If I can just transfer it to a $150 gear, why bother with expensive gear? This is the thing I don't get and the reason why I think all the pricier IEM tuning sounds like ass on the Bunny. I'm obviously wrong so help me understand.

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisn√¶s Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told ¬£1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are‚Äî 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it‚Äîdo yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

They do seem to make them a bit less toasty (which was not a problem, but was noticeable with the stock pads for me). They also change the frequency response a bit, tilt it a bit to the high end, and open it up slightly. Not an improvement, for me, I like the warm, slightly more intimate feel of the stock pads a bit better, but not something that would stop me from using these either. Sound is still great. Edit: I had said that the sound isolation was not as good, but I am going back and forth now, and really, it is about the same. Also, going back and forth between the two, the sound difference really is minimal - it is there, but less then my initial impression. I don't hear much of a difference in bass either. I think the sound changes a little as the pads warm up, maybe the seal becomes a little better, and the differences, which are not much to begin with, decrease.\n\n Wondering what peoples impressions are, if anyone is still using these on their Maxwell? I am contemplating whether to keep them or not.",

I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say ‚Äî these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural ‚Äî vocals, instruments, bass ‚Äî nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven‚Äôt noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it‚Äôs natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head ‚Äî soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn‚Äôt use them for workouts (they‚Äôre not built for that kind of movement), but they‚Äôre fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal ‚Äî so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you‚Äôre in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you‚Äôve already paired ‚Äî that‚Äôs super convenient. Battery life is great too ‚Äî around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere‚Äôs also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I‚Äôve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I‚Äôve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They‚Äôre not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they‚Äôre absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

I'll primarily be using them with my iPhone 12 Pro.\n\nI've been reading a lot about how using a Bluetooth dongle, like the Sennheiser BTD 600, is essential to get the absolute best sound quality out of these with an iPhone. The catch is that these dongles are USB-C and my iPhone is Lightning.\n\nI found this USB-C to Lightning adapter and was wondering a couple of things:\n * Has anyone here tried this kind of adapter setup with the BTD 600 and a Lightning iPhone? Does it actually work?\n * For those who have used the dongle with an iPhone/iOS device, does it really make a significant difference to the sound quality compared to the standard Bluetooth connection (which uses AAC)?\n\nAny advice would be awesome!

    "selftext": "So the last few weeks I‚Äôve been hunting for my first pair of real headphones. I‚Äôve been using Astro A50s for a while they‚Äôre great for gaming, but man, they get super uncomfortable after like an hour.\n\nI‚Äôm totally new to the audiophile world, and holy hell, there are so many options. I had no clue where to start, so of course I did what any sane person would do I went to Reddit. I got a few a different suggestions but as I was searching through all of them I ended up looking up the Meze 109 pros and immediately fell in love with the looks. The wood finish on the cups matches my setup perfectly.\n\nSo I take the plunge ‚Äî $800 on the 109 Pros and another $200 on a Topping DX3 Pro+. Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and‚Ä¶ they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn‚Äôt notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I‚Äôd just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I‚Äôd give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two ‚Äî same story. Day three, same thing at first‚Ä¶ until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I‚Äôd never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I‚Äôm just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I‚Äôm not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

    "selftext": "First off, I am new to the headphone space so please excuse my lack of understanding.\n\nI have noticed that most reviewers, whether that's a review on YouTube, or an article on their website, place heavy emphasis on the frequency response curve. They will place this above all else when it comes to sound quality.\nFrom what I understand, frequency response curve is more indicative of a headphones 'sound signature' or what the manufacturer intended it to sound like but is not the only or imo main factor in the overall sound quality. \nFor example, when you compare a cheap pair of headphones to a more expensive one, no matter how well the cheap pair is tuned, it will still lack detail or resolution that the more expensive headphone will have (based on my experience). You might not hear the small variations in the artists vocals or the instruments. It can also lack clarity in the sound. \nSo, I feel, the frequency response curve is only one aspect of the overall sound quality, but there are many more things to consider and compare. You would expect an expensive pair of headphones to still sound 'better' even if it's not tuned closer to the Harman curve compared to a cheaper pair, just because of the better drivers, better materials and superior sound processing. \n\nIf so, why do reviews not talk about the rest of the factors affecting sound quality and focus almost purely on the sound signature, which to some extent can be fixed with an EQ, when the rest of it is not adjustable? \nSometimes they make it seem as if a well tuned $50 pair is better than a $400 pair which is better better build with better materials, with it's only shortcoming being a slightly worse tuning. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Or am I approaching this wrong?\nIs sound signature the defining factor in sound quality and listening experience or should we focus equally on things like clarity, resolution, ability to recreate the small variations in the sound, distortion?\nDo they avoid it because these other factors can't be quantified easily?

I found the ASH-IR-Dataset and just started messing with room impulse files. Then I tried one called Calypso, and that was the first time it actually felt like I was sitting in a room, not listening to a weird effect. The next game-changer was headphone correction. You have to EQ your headphones to a diffuse-field target first. It makes the headphones neutral for the simulation to work on.\n\nThat's when I found the ASH-Toolset. It took me literal days of tweaking to get a sound that wasn't just \"good\" but correct. You have to learn the settings because the defaults probably won't work for you. The most critical part is the HRTF dataset (the \"dummy head\" recordings). You have to test them all (KEMAR, KU 100, etc.) Your ears are physically unique. The HRTF that's perfect for me will sound weird and wrong to you. If you don't find the one that anatomically clicks with your brain, you will never get that true \"in front of you\" sound.\n\nFor the first time in my life, music is actually in front of me, originating from a point in space outside my head.

The effect is insane on my IEMs, super precise and immersive. On my HD 650s, it's also incredible, but the sense of space is wider and less \"in your face,\" a totally different but equally cool vibe.

    "selftext": "Hello. Posting here cause headphone advice auto deleted this. :( \n\nI have the DT 1990 Pros (not MKII) currently, the left driver stopped working like a week ago or so. I decided to google what could be the cause, something led me to believe that the coil wire(?), the ultra thin varnished tiny wire was broken, so I opened it and sure enough it was. Replacement drivers are $192, I bought mine in 2022 for $550. New ones now cost $300\\~$350 depending on sales and such. So I was thinking is it even worth repairing at this point or just upgrade to better headphones. My choice that I landed on (kinda heavily at this stage) are the Meze 109 Pros. I am waiting for a sale for them as I've seen them as low as $628 or so, instead of the $750 they are right now (with coupon or something). I've seen a lot of reviews of these and lot's of people say these could be considered \"end game?\" for a lot of people. I am by no means an audiophile so fair enough in this case. Another thing I heard is the cable provided with these is kinda \"meh\" for the price of the headphones and suggestions seem to say to upgrade it. Not sure to what though. Any input is wholly welcomed. Thanks!\n\nBudget I'm hoping to stick under $800.\n\nMainly for listening to music or playing a few games like Rust and such\n\nI have the SMSL AO300 AMP\n\nAny input is wholly welcomed.

But for nu-metal (Limp Bizkit and others) and electronic music, I wanted something more atmospheric and physical.  \nI listen to music on different devices and software, so EQ isn‚Äôt really an option. I like character ‚Äî not neutrality.\n\nMy first shortlist was Fostex TH900 Mk2 and Sony MRZ-1, but none were available.  \nI ended up getting the FatFreq Deuce ‚Äî the IEMs with the most powerful sub-bass I‚Äôve ever heard.\n\nThen the Virtuoso was announced, and after auditioning them twice, I finally added them to my collection.\n\n**Cons for first:**\n\nFor around $1000, you get a fancy case and Alcantara on the headband and pads. That‚Äôs it. The rest of the materials and build quality feel cheap as shit. Fit isn‚Äôt particularly comfortable either. The screw-in cable connectors make me question the design logic.  \nMaybe I‚Äôm just spoiled by Meze, but overall it feels far from premium.\n\n**Sound**\n\nTested on iBasso Nunchaku, Chord Mojo 2, Astell&Kern ACRO CA1000T, and Cayin HA-2A.  \nI don‚Äôt feel any difference between the gear, so don‚Äôt overpay for it.\n\nOverall, the sound is moderately detailed with good instrument separation ‚Äî  \nan aggressive V-shape with some interesting midrange nuance.  \nThe louder it gets, the richer and denser it becomes.\n\n**Bass**:  \nStrong and plentiful, but not aggressive. Moderately textured, adds weight and body.  \nElectronic and hip-hop tracks sound fantastic.\n\n**Treble**:  \nThere‚Äôs a lot of it. Crisp, sometimes aggressive on cymbals ‚Äî reminds me of the Meze 109 Pro.\n\n**Mids**:  \nThis is where it gets interesting. A&K seems to have borrowed Ultrasone‚Äôs S-Logic spatial trickery,  \nso vocals float ‚Äúin the air‚Äù. When the music carries ambient layers or atmospheric elements, it‚Äôs genuinely captivating.\n\nOverall, the sound is unusual yet very pleasant ‚Äî cohesive, engaging, and fun to listen to.\n\nPosting this because there are almost no reviews or proper FR measurements online.  \nIf you‚Äôre looking for something unique and a bit different, maybe this will help.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I need some advice from the Audeze experts here. I'm about to buy a used LCD-X and I'm confused about which version it is.\n\n**The Facts:**\n\n* Serial Number: **7526658**\n* Purchased new: **March 10, 2021** from xxxx (authorized Swiss dealer)\n* Original invoice included\n* Current asking price: **\\~‚Ç¨850)** \\- seems like a good deal\n\n**The Confusion:** According to what I found online, LCD-X units with serial numbers **7527600 or higher** should be the 2021 revision. This one is 7526658, so technically *below* that threshold.\n\n**BUT** \\- and this is where it gets interesting - **the headphone has ALL the 2021 visual characteristics:**\n\n* ‚úÖ Modern suspension headband (not the old rigid design)\n* ‚úÖ Metal mesh grills (not fabric)\n* ‚úÖ New shiny leather earpads (not the old memory foam style)\n* ‚úÖ Overall 2021 aesthetic\n\nThe seller confirms **everything is original** \\- nothing has been replaced or upgraded. He bought it exactly like this in March 2021.\n\n**My Theory:** Could this be an early 2021 production unit or a transition model for the European market? Maybe Audeze started the 2021 revision slightly before the \"official\" serial number threshold, especially for international markets?\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Has anyone seen LCD-X units with 2021 components but serial numbers below 7527600?\n2. Do you think this is actually a 2021 model that just happened to get an earlier serial number?\n3. At 850 EUROS with all 2021 components visible, is this a no-brainer purchase even if there's uncertainty?\n\nI've contacted Audeze support but thought I'd ask the community too. Any insights would be really appreciated!\n\n**TL;DR:** LCD-X serial 7526658 (below 2021 threshold) but has all 2021 physical features. Bought new March 2021. Is it a 2021 model? Worth buying at ‚Ç¨850?",

    "title": "Trying to further my understanding of headphone power needs",
    "selftext": "I made a post in HeadohonesAdvice recently asking about the plausibility of running a pair of Sennheiser HD 600 off a dongle dac. At least half of the purpose of me asking is to learn more about the technical side of this audio technology, because I love learning and I have a strong desire to understand how things work. Having a strong base of knowledge can make me a more informed consumer if nothing else. \n\nThe responses ranged from ‚Äúno dongle will really provide enough power to run those headphones properly, even if it sounds loud enough‚Äù to ‚Äúamps are snake oil, don‚Äôt waste your money, just use an Apple dongle or, if you really want to blast it, get a fiio ka11 or something.‚Äù\n\nI found it truly interesting that both sides of this argument vehemently insist they are correct, which leads me to believe the science that goes into answering a question like this must be very nuanced and not at all black and white. \n\nStarting with the ‚Äúwhy volume doesn‚Äôt always mean enough power‚Äù argument, the best explanation I could find is that dynamic drivers don‚Äôt have consistent voltage needs across the entire audio spectrum. More specifically, the bass and upper treble have more power needs, and that power form what I‚Äôve gathered is voltage for volume and current for driver control. I may be oversimplifying or possibly just wrong so forgive me, but the broader point is that even if the sound in general sounds loud enough and is therefore getting enough power, parts of the frequency response might not be getting what they need especially when it comes to music with a lot of dynamic range or large peaks in volume. The idea here is that ‚Äúit sounds loud enough to me‚Äù could be an incomplete picture. \n\nOn the other side of the argument I‚Äôm seeing that the above argument is a hypothetical and over complicated concern, that for a high-impedance set like the HD 600 if you can get it loud enough for normal listening then you are supplying it with all the power it needs since voltage equals volume and voltage is the main concern with a headphone like this (as opposed to a set that has low impedance but high current needs). Even Crinacle, a popular figure in the audiophile space, claims that something like the ka11 can provide ‚Äúway too much power‚Äù and could easily run a set of HD 800s at ‚Äúear-splitting volume‚Äù.  Not that his word is gold, or anything, but he still strikes me as someone with a lot of experience and knowledge. \n\nMeanwhile back on the other side again, you can look up power calculators for headphones that more or less verify most dongles won‚Äôt be able to supply the necessary voltage or current for high impedance headphones to run at max potential/without clipping part of the frequency response. \n\nApologies for the wall of text here, I just wanted to provide context for the rabbit hole I‚Äôm going down. I should make it clear I‚Äôm not ‚Äúworried‚Äù about this, I‚Äôm perfectly happy to enjoy my headphones and my music without wringing my hands worrying if I‚Äôm doing it properly. This is purely because I want to learn. I like learning. It‚Äôs that simple. And in service of that, I‚Äôd be interested to hear more detailed information on either side of this argument. Correct me where I‚Äôm wrong, elaborate where I‚Äôm oversimplifying, provide additional context I might not be considering. The folks here seem passionate and knowledgeable and I would be grateful if any of you would be willing to share your wisdom with me in the name of learning new things!",

I thought maybe it would be nice to have a set I can use from my couch if I want to play my PC games on the TV instead of my monitors.\n\nFor reference, some of the headphones I have are the 6xx, Aeon Closed RT, and Aeolus. I had a ton more in the past but those are the ones I kept.\n\nAnyway, the Maxwell came today. I purchased them new from Amazon. The seal was broken on the box, not sure what that was about.\n\nOverall, they somehow feel well built and fragile at the same time. I don't particularly like how they sit on my head. They feel heavy which in itself is not a big deal but they feel unbalanced.\n\nThey sound good for a wireless set, but they don't get loud enough IMO and I feel like I'm missing some details/separation. These could never replace something like the Aeon Closed RT + Dac/Amp for me.\n\nI'm going to send them back and get the Edition XV instead I think. I could see these working for some if you really need a wireless headset.

Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told ¬£1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

    "selftext": "So, I‚Äôve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn‚Äôt stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it‚Äôs no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they‚Äôd be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they‚Äôre better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they‚Äôre still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I‚Äôm really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an ‚Äúactive analog mode‚Äù which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you‚Äôre looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC‚Ä¶ look no further!",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisn√¶s Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

Literally stood there with my mouth hanging open.\n\nThere were hundreds of headphones on display that day, but none of them came close to what the Grado delivered. The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are‚Äî 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it‚Äîdo yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say ‚Äî these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural ‚Äî vocals, instruments, bass ‚Äî nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven‚Äôt noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it‚Äôs natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head ‚Äî soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn‚Äôt use them for workouts (they‚Äôre not built for that kind of movement), but they‚Äôre fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal ‚Äî so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you‚Äôre in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you‚Äôve already paired ‚Äî that‚Äôs super convenient. Battery life is great too ‚Äî around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere‚Äôs also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I‚Äôve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I‚Äôve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They‚Äôre not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they‚Äôre absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

    "selftext": "So the last few weeks I‚Äôve been hunting for my first pair of real headphones. I‚Äôve been using Astro A50s for a while they‚Äôre great for gaming, but man, they get super uncomfortable after like an hour.\n\nI‚Äôm totally new to the audiophile world, and holy hell, there are so many options. I had no clue where to start, so of course I did what any sane person would do I went to Reddit. I got a few a different suggestions but as I was searching through all of them I ended up looking up the Meze 109 pros and immediately fell in love with the looks. The wood finish on the cups matches my setup perfectly.\n\nSo I take the plunge ‚Äî $800 on the 109 Pros and another $200 on a Topping DX3 Pro+. Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and‚Ä¶ they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn‚Äôt notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I‚Äôd just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I‚Äôd give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two ‚Äî same story. Day three, same thing at first‚Ä¶ until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I‚Äôd never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I‚Äôm just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I‚Äôm not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

I thought maybe it would be nice to have a set I can use from my couch if I want to play my PC games on the TV instead of my monitors.\n\nFor reference, some of the headphones I have are the 6xx, Aeon Closed RT, and Aeolus. I had a ton more in the past but those are the ones I kept.\n\nAnyway, the Maxwell came today. I purchased them new from Amazon. The seal was broken on the box, not sure what that was about.\n\nOverall, they somehow feel well built and fragile at the same time. I don't particularly like how they sit on my head. They feel heavy which in itself is not a big deal but they feel unbalanced.\n\nThey sound good for a wireless set, but they don't get loud enough IMO and I feel like I'm missing some details/separation. These could never replace something like the Aeon Closed RT + Dac/Amp for me.\n\nI'm going to send them back and get the Edition XV instead I think. I could see these working for some if you really need a wireless headset. But if you are just playing games at a desk or consuming media at a desk....wired headphones will always be the better option.",

I started a year and a half ago buying the Momentum 4, then last year in November for my birthday I got the QC Ultra, then for last year Christmas I got the WH-1000XM5, then by march of this year I got the Fiio K7BT + HIFIMAN Arya Stealth combo and by July of this year I got the Airpods Pro 2 and Airpods Max.\n\nYeah I know, I dont know why I need 4 over the ear ANC headphones, actually, I dont, but I just enjoy it, it makes me happy and brings me joy on my day to day, yes, I do use them all, I mostly spend less than half a week without using one of them, and yes, I know I could have bought only 1 over the ear ANC headphone and get a Clear OG or a HD 600 and something else for the money to complement my HIFIMAN, but I just like ANC headphones, I just dont know what to say about it.\n\nIs it an addiction? Honestly? Yes, but as long as Im able to spend on it with my own hard work, and as long as they keep bringing me happiness, Ill keep going with it.\n\nLove this hobby and love the joy and experiences it brings with it :)",

Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told ¬£1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

One of the main reasons I‚Äôm looking into other ways of gaming is because I want to try modding. I did consider switching to a gaming PC, but that‚Äôs not an option for me right now.\n\nThat‚Äôs what led me to the Steam Deck ‚Äî I‚Äôve heard the performance is solid, and that you *can* mod games on it, though it‚Äôs more complicated than on a regular PC.\n\nThe main game I‚Äôm looking at is Elden Ring, since I‚Äôve seen some really cool mods for it, but I would also like to try it with other games as well. If anyone has some input on this, I would appreciate it.\n\nEven with that aside, is the SteamDec overall worth it?\n\nThank you!",

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still play games on my PC, but now it‚Äôs different; I actually WANT to play games again. There‚Äôs just something so nice about being able to play what I want no matter where I am. With the expansion of it being a computer too, I can emulate games or just tinker with my system, opening a whole new world of things I can do. \n\nSo, if you can, get a steam deck.

Entered BIOS (even here the trackpads were unresponsive) and enabled Battery Storage Mode\n5. Reset controller settings by holding Quick Access + volume down button.\n6. Reset controller settings to default in the settings\n7. Used Repair OS tool in the settings\n8. Factory Reset \n\nAll proved to be ineffective.\n\nThe trackpads used to work without any issues before the right one first stopped working. The most \"explorative\" thing I did with my deck was install Retrodeck but I never actually got it working or loaded any ROMs so it was just empty. Also installed CachyOS to be able to run WuWa before Steam officially added support.\n\nI've had my Steam Deck since Nov last year. I didn't really play games that heavily use trackpads either so now I'm just honestly confused about what triggered the issue.\n\nYou might be wondering why it took me four months to post here. I didn't want to Factory Reset my deck until I had backed up all my media and just didn't have the time to deal with that until recently. That didn't fix it as well hence this post.\n\nOn top of all that, I live in a SEA country where it's really hard to find shops that repair steam decks, if there even is any.\n\nIf anyone has experienced this issue or something similar and solved it, kindly drop your solutions below. Thank you. :(",

    "selftext": "My steam deck keeps waking up without me pushing the button. My first short term fix was to just shut down, so I know it wasn't a hardware issue. I looked around on here and some people suggest turning off Bluetooth. And that works for me.\n\nBut I mostly play docked. And I only use my xbox one controller. So I have no idea what wakes it up. I checked the blue tooth and nothing is connected. Ive connected headphones before but they are not on or connected now. It's very annoying. I basically have to turn blue tooth off and then push sleep(instead of doing it via my controller).\n\nAny help would be appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "Hello! I‚Äôve been lurking in this community since I got my steam deck last year when I was 21. The main driving force behind me getting a steam deck was because I simply have no room for a PC desk set up right now. A big reason for me picking one up is because many people praised the device for its emulation capabilities. I became obsessed with the deck when I first got it. (I have a 512gb Oled with a 512sd card) it was so beautiful! And just the sheer knowledge of knowing that any game I bought from steam would follow me to my ultimate goal of owning a PC, made me addicted. I got so wrapped up in playing FF7 and Dave the Diver that emulation completely slipped my mind until almost 1 whole year later. Now I‚Äôm feeling a little bit of FOMO for the switch 2, and a little jealous that they get Mario Galaxy 1 & 2. Then it hit me, I could just emulate it. After setting up emu deck I realized that for a whole year I was just scratching the surface on this thing. It surprises me all the time! Also Quick Resume saves my life‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I can get another device if it doesn‚Äôt have it. I need my little steam deck reward between chores. What‚Äôs a steam deck feature that never ceases to amaze you? ",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nThis might be the wrong place to ask, buy anyway. I hope someone has some insights.\n\nCurrently in the market for my first handheld. As I'm not a huge gamer (Fulltime job, 4 kids, horses and dogs), my playing time is rather limited. I only have an Xbox Series S but I hope with a handheld I might get more playtime (e.g. when kids/wife are watching TV I can't play Xbox...so...). Also not really into AAA games at full/max settings (the Series S can't handle that anyway)\n\nConsidering this, I don't want to spend too much. \n\nCurrently, in some online stores, the Legion Go S Z2 Go SteamOS edition is sold at 399‚Ç¨. So I'm really considering this. But I read that fan noise can go up quite a bit.\n\nHence I'm also looking into the Steam Deck LCD (might get the OLED) which seems quieter. Even if older and not quite as performant, I figure that for my use case it will be enough. \n\nI plan to play in bed while wifey is asleep. So Fan noise is a HUGE factor for me.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nRegards",

Free up as much space as possible (uninstall games, etc.) before trying again.\n2. **Disable Fast Startup in Windows**\n   * Go to **Control Panel > Power Options > Choose what the power buttons do**.\n   * Uncheck **‚ÄúTurn on fast startup‚Äù**.\n3. **Disable Secure Boot in BIOS**\n4. **Disable Fast Boot in BIOS**\n5. **Create a SteamOS recovery USB**\n   * Follow Valve‚Äôs official guide: [https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227)\n6. **Boot into the SteamOS recovery USB**\n7. **Open Konsole (terminal) on the recovery desktop**\n8. **Clone my project & run the script**\n9. **Follow the prompts** It will patch the installer to target your new free space.\n10. **Reboot and enjoy SteamOS dual boot without wiping Windows!**\n\nThis has been **tested on the ROG Ally X** and should also work on the **Lenovo Legion Go**. Feedback welcome if you try it on other devices.\n\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è The script needs there to be an \"unallocated\" section of your disk. If you get part way through and things fail or something goes wrong, the script will need that you clean up the partitions that it creates and return back to just having the unallocated space. \n\n",

    "selftext": "The biggest selling point for purchasing my Steam Deck was the promise of quality gyro aiming in any game I wanted through \"Steam Inputs\" that the device can reasonably support. The Deck, has not disappointed in that regard. It has made so many action shooters I've played on the platform so fun! Regardless, if I played it for the 1st time or 100th time. Offering significantly better aiming experiences in these titles than they originally ever had with a controller before. While not needing any aim assist. Including a lot of the older ones. Though, the newer shooters benefit just as much. I'd even argue it is more immersive and satisfying as well.\n\n \"Tomb Raider\" (2013), has be been no exception. Just thought I'd share one of the biggest reasons why I love my Steam Deck with the community. How much of a game changer this feature has been for me personally. People give Nintendo all the praise for gyro controls. However, it's my opinion, Valve, is leading the way with the Steam Deck and Steam Inputs. As they support the feature fully and keep it updated. Making sure people actually have consistent, quality, fundamental access to it. Offering quality experiences. Valve, seems to understand gyro aims value. Which is awesome! Something the other major gaming platforms are still very far behind in unfortunately. It's not even close. \n\nI love this thing! \n\n[Steam Deck] [Gyro Aim] [Tomb Raider 2013] [No Aim Assist]",

I was stupid and didn't thought about the fact that this new game autosave was going to overwrite the other one with everything on it.\n\nMy question:\n\nIs there a way to retrieve the autosave prior to the moment I started a new game? Am I screwed?\n\n\nWhat I tried so far:\n\nGoing into steam website to check cloud saves. Found that there is only one FFXII_000 file (000 is the autosave, 001 and etc. are the manual saves). I tried opening the save file with the text viewer from Steam Deck desktop view to no avail. Only weird symbols.",

I basically go to work and home, and whenever I do go somewhere I'm the one driving. \n\nLately though, there's days where I get home from work and I'd like to play some games, but I just don't feel like sitting at my desk to play them (which is what first made the SD appealing). I also have quite the backlog on Steam, and I've heard the Deck is great for burning through your backlog. I'm also interested in getting into emulation of older/retro games, since I feel I missed out on a lot of them from not gaming much as a kid.\n\nSo basically, do you think the Steam Deck would be worth it for me?",

But I was wondering if I should install other stuff like Decky (I‚Äôve heard a lot of conflicting reports about it recently)\n\nLike I said this is my first SteamDeck so would love to hear if there are is any other stuff I should install or look into to help optimise the experience? Look forward to hearing some suggestions!",

    "selftext": "The biggest selling point for purchasing my Steam Deck was the promise of quality gyro aiming in any game I wanted through \"Steam Inputs\" that the device can reasonably support. The Deck, has not disappointed in that regard. It has made so many action shooters I've played on the platform so fun! Regardless, if I played it for the 1st time or 100th time. Offering significantly better aiming experiences in these titles than they originally ever had with a controller before. While not needing any aim assist. Including a lot of the older ones. Though, the newer shooters benefit just as much. I'd even argue it is more immersive and satisfying as well.\n\n \"Tomb Raider\" (2013), has be been no exception. Just thought I'd share one of the biggest reasons why I love my Steam Deck with the community. How much of a game changer this feature has been for me personally. People give Nintendo all the praise for gyro controls. However, it's my opinion, Valve, is leading the way with the Steam Deck and Steam Inputs. As they support the feature fully and keep it updated. Making sure people actually have consistent, quality, fundamental access to it. Offering quality experiences. Valve, seems to understand gyro aims value. Which is awesome! Something the other major gaming platforms are still very far behind in unfortunately. It's not even close. \n\nI love this thing! \n\n[Steam Deck] [Gyro Aim] [Tomb Raider 2013] [No Aim Assist]",

When the steam deck first came out, I was excited like the rest of you. I somehow convinced myself from making the purchase when it first got released back in 2022. I have a beast of a PC, why would I need one? If I am going to be out and have extra time, I can just get some reading done instead of gaming.\n\nWell, now I am a mom and I figured I would treat myself to the OLED. My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby. Back to a time without all the responsibilities I carry now, I could have endlessly enjoyed the steam deck. I missed out on three years of being able to potato on the couch after a hard day at work. Before you weep for me, do not worry. I fully plan to own a steam deck for the rest of my life to make up for it.\n\nTL;DR: Buy a steam deck, and live a happy life.",

I basically go to work and home, and whenever I do go somewhere I'm the one driving. \n\nLately though, there's days where I get home from work and I'd like to play some games, but I just don't feel like sitting at my desk to play them (which is what first made the SD appealing). I also have quite the backlog on Steam, and I've heard the Deck is great for burning through your backlog. I'm also interested in getting into emulation of older/retro games, since I feel I missed out on a lot of them from not gaming much as a kid.\n\nSo basically, do you think the Steam Deck would be worth it for me?",

    "selftext": "So I was playing no Man Sky. I was enjoying it but I was getting a little bored. That's when I got distracted by my backlog so I stayed playing Death Stranding. Gotten quite far (chapter 5) but essentially I'm getting bored again it's just a massive fetch quest, with long cut scenes let's be honest. Although I am compelled to keep going. I'm not hating it but I'm some what addicted.\n\nSo again I'm sitting here with my steam deck holding forwards and walking through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape and my mind is wondering. I kinda want play a bit of street fighter 6. But I know if I stop playing Death Stranding there's a really big chance I might not come back to it for months. So I keep walking forwards, almost begrudgingly.\n\nThinking back to NMS, I can't remember what I was doing and what I planning to do next. If I boot that up again it might as well be someone else's save. So i probably need to start again. I was about 30 or 40 hours in. That would be the 3rd time I've started NMS again.\n\nThe list goes further back. Death Loop, Disco Elysium (started that around 4 times!), factorio, Dave the diver (I'm almost at the end and then I suddenly dropped it), dredge, elden ring, Kingdom come deliverance, jedi survivor. The last game I finished was Prey, which was excellent.\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue? What do you do? I wonder if it's worth keeping a game diary but honestly it seems like a lot of effort and kinda overkill for a casual endeavor. I don't have ADHD or anything...I don't think.\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "The biggest selling point for purchasing my Steam Deck was the promise of quality gyro aiming in any game I wanted through \"Steam Inputs\" that the device can reasonably support. The Deck, has not disappointed in that regard. It has made so many action shooters I've played on the platform so fun! Regardless, if I played it for the 1st time or 100th time. Offering significantly better aiming experiences in these titles than they originally ever had with a controller before. While not needing any aim assist. Including a lot of the older ones. Though, the newer shooters benefit just as much. I'd even argue it is more immersive and satisfying as well.\n\n \"Tomb Raider\" (2013), has be been no exception. Just thought I'd share one of the biggest reasons why I love my Steam Deck with the community. How much of a game changer this feature has been for me personally. People give Nintendo all the praise for gyro controls. However, it's my opinion, Valve, is leading the way with the Steam Deck and Steam Inputs. As they support the feature fully and keep it updated. Making sure people actually have consistent, quality, fundamental access to it. Offering quality experiences. Valve, seems to understand gyro aims value. Which is awesome! Something the other major gaming platforms are still very far behind in unfortunately. It's not even close. \n\nI love this thing! \n\n[Steam Deck] [Gyro Aim] [Tomb Raider 2013] [No Aim Assist]",

I have a beast of a PC, why would I need one? If I am going to be out and have extra time, I can just get some reading done instead of gaming.\n\nWell, now I am a mom and I figured I would treat myself to the OLED. My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby. Back to a time without all the responsibilities I carry now, I could have endlessly enjoyed the steam deck. I missed out on three years of being able to potato on the couch after a hard day at work. Before you weep for me, do not worry. I fully plan to own a steam deck for the rest of my life to make up for it.\n\nTL;DR: Buy a steam deck, and live a happy life.",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! üòä)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It‚Äôs not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt want to give up gardening‚Äîespecially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations ‚Äî this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier‚Äôs water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125‚Äì250 m¬≥/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot ‚Äì all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 ‚Äì 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I‚Äôm Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it‚Äôs possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I‚Äôd love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I‚Äôm really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I‚Äôm planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant‚Äôs growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. ‚ÄûThis is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?‚Äú\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can‚Äôt physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It‚Äôs not overkill‚Äîit‚Äôs my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. ‚ÄûThis must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou‚Äôre right, it does. This isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. ‚ÄûIs it still ‚Äögrowing‚Äò if everything is automated?‚Äú\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn‚Äôt just manual labor‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. ‚ÄûWhat happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. ‚ÄûWhy go public with something like this?‚Äú\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it‚Äôs possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. ‚ÄûWhy not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?‚Äú\r\n-\tFor many, that‚Äôs a great option‚Äîbut not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can‚Äôt reach into the tent. It‚Äôs not about convenience; it‚Äôs a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. ‚ÄûDo you have any pictures of the build process itself?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things‚Äîthe automation, the code, and making it accessible‚Äîthat we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚Äöbuild‚Äò for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I‚Äôll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. ‚ÄûHow do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn‚Äôt the power draw a major issue?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot‚Äîa task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7‚Äì4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîit could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like ‚Äûoverkill‚Äú to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn‚Äôt replace my involvement‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn‚Äôt about being lazy; it‚Äôs about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

So I know my setup works in general, but this specific bulb just won't connect.\nThe bulb powers on fine and goes into pairing mode (blinking), but it times out every single time at the network connection step.\nHas anyone else dealt with this timeout error on the Essential model specifically? Any ideas why one bulb would work fine but the other won't? Thanks in advance for any help!",

The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

So yeah if an AI Chef Assistant can save me a few hours a week, I‚Äôm all in.\n\nI‚Äôve been looking into a few of these AI sous chef tools like Samsung‚Äôs SmartThings Cooking, June Oven, and Brava‚Äôs smart light tech etcte. What really caught my attention though is Gambit Robotics AND mostly because it seems to focus on real-time guidance instead of just automation which allows me to just turn off my brain when i get home.\n\nI get that some people see this as cheating or lazy but honestly? For busy professionals, that‚Äôs the point. We don‚Äôt want to replace cooking we just want to make it less stressful. If tech can make homemade food easier to pull off after a 10-hour workday + I get to go to the gym, imagine the daily impact of that in the long run and tbhh that‚Äôs a win in my book",

Power is already available at the gate, and the electric strike works fine.\n\nMy idea was to install a mobile LTE/5G router at the gate to provide Wi-Fi there and then use a device like Ring or a similar system for the video doorbell.\n\nMy questions:\n\t‚Ä¢\tWould you approach this differently?\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny recommendations for specific brands or systems?\n\t‚Ä¢\tCan a system like Ring, Nuki (or similar) actually control an electric strike, or would I need a different setup for that part?\n\t‚Ä¢\tIdeally, I‚Äôd like one provider for both the gate doorbell and a smart doorbell/lock at the main house door, to keep everything within one ecosystem, or do you think that having different systems does not make a huge difference?\n\nThanks a lot for any tips or setups that worked well for you!",

    "selftext": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI'd like to share my open-source project **Proxmox-GitOps**, a Container Automation platform for provisioning and orchestrating Linux containers (LXC) on Proxmox VE - encapsulated as comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC).\n\n**Proxmox-GitOps (@Github)**: [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps)\n¬†\n* **Demo** (~1m): [https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY](https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY)\n\n* **Demo** (low, no ads): [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif)\n\n\n**TL;DR**: By encapsulating infrastructure within an extensible monorepository - recursively resolved from Git submodules at runtime - Proxmox-GitOps provides a comprehensive Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) abstraction for an entire, automated, container-based infrastructure.\n\nOriginally, it was a personal attempt to bring industrial automation and cloud patterns to my Proxmox home server. It's designed as a platform architecture for a self-contained, bootstrappable system - a generic IaC abstraction (customize, extend, .. open standards, base package only, .. - you name it üòâ) that automates the entire infrastructure. It was initially driven by the question of what a Proxmox-based GitOps automation could look like and how it could be organized.\n\n**Core Concepts**\n\n* **Recursive Self-management**: Control plane seeds itself by pushing its monorepository onto a locally bootstrapped instance, triggering a pipeline that recursively provisions the control plane onto PVE.\n\n* **Monorepository**: Centralizes infrastructure as comprehensive IaC artifact (for mirroring, like the project itself on Github) using submodules for modular composition.\n\n* **Git as State**: Git repository represents the desired infrastructure state.\n\n* **Loose coupling**: Containers are decoupled from the control plane, enabling runtime replacement and independent operation.\n\nOver the past few months, the project stabilized, and I‚Äôve addressed many questions you had in Wiki, summarized to documentation, which should now covers essential technical, conceptual, and practical aspects. I‚Äôve also added a short demo that breaks down the theory by demonstrating the automation of an IaC stack (Home Assistant, Mosquitto bridge, Zigbee2MQTT broker, snapshot restore, reverse proxy, dynamically configured via PVE API), with automated container system updates and service checks.\n\n**What am I looking for?** It's a noncommercial, passion-driven project. I'm looking to collaborate with other engineers who share the excitement of building a self-contained, bootstrappable platform architecture that addresses the question: What should our home automation look like?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts!",

    "selftext": "Last year, I installed a k-type thermocouple in my wood stove flue pipe. Coupled with an esp8266, it's let me keep track of stove temperatures and helped optimize burns (when to cut back primary air, when to reload, etc). As a result, last week when I cleaned the chimney for the season, I had virtually no creosote build up.  I had set up some simple notifications to our phones like over fire when temp > 800F and reload when temp < 250F, but it was a bit of a pain to pull my phone out throughout the night to keep tabs on the stove. Tonight, I mapped the temperature reading to a hue value on the hue/sat color wheel and setup an automation to gradually adjust a virtually unused wyze color bulb in the corner for a visual stove temperature indication. After burn #1 with it in place, I'm pretty satisfied! Blue = cold, green = target, red = hot. With the hue mapping, color gradually adjusts every 30s in small increments throughout the burn.\n\n  \nFull write up here: [https://houndhillhomestead.com/smart-light-wood-stove-temperature-indication/](https://houndhillhomestead.com/smart-light-wood-stove-temperature-indication/)\n\nAnd original stove monitoring write up here: [https://houndhillhomestead.com/woodstove-temperature-monitoring/](https://houndhillhomestead.com/woodstove-temperature-monitoring/)",

    "title": "My impression of SmartWings shades",
    "selftext": "The other day I got into a convo wth another Redditor who asked in this sub some specifics about SmartWings shades. I bought some earlier this year for a couple of the bedrooms and then installed a set in my home office yesterday, so I thought I would write a longer review.\n\nMy smarthome setup consists of Google Home, a Hubitat hub, and primarily Z-Wave Plus products. All of my SmartWings shades have Z-Wave Plus motors. In the bedrooms I installed 90% blackout Zebra shades. Yesterday I installed a 70% blackout woven wood roller shade in my home office.\n\nWhen ordering there's a good bit of information to fill in and a number of choices to make, so be sure to allow yourself a sufficient block of time. The fabric colors are clearly outlined but it's not always easy to make a proper comparison from a PC or phone. You can order a book of fabric samples, which I did prior to placing my second order.\n\nThe measuring instructions are clear and there's no need to overcompensate for anything. I added the minimum suggested amount to the window length and the side blackout works great. For the Zebra shade height I overcompensated and ended up having to mount the Zebra shades higher than originally planned because the bedroom window sills jut out a bit. The Zebra shades have to be mounted at an exact height so that the fabric lines up correctly when the shade is fully closed.  If there's no obstruction like a window sill then that won't really matter, but in my case it did and I measured too long, That was user error on my part. Just measure the window height and add the suggested amount for the mounts. There's no need to add any length past that.\n\nShipping takes a few weeks since they come from China. Once the order is marked as in transit, the shipment arrives within a few days.\n\nInstallation is easy, unless you measure too long like I did. :D There are a handful of brackets to install for the Zebra shades, and if you order an outside mount like I did, there are extenders to install as well. The woven wood shade that I ordered recently is even easier to install, with brackets only and a top-down connection. I recommend having an installation buddy for any blind wider than a single window. The blinds aren't heavy but if lengthy they can be unwieldy to hold solo.\n\nConnecting to the home network is easy, requiring only the app for your hub and the appropriate PIN or ID for the device.\n\nI didn't get the solar chargers on any of the blinds, figuring I would just charge them as needed. Thus far I've only had to charge the bedroom blinds twice in 8 months. \n\nI've been highly satisfied with the blinds in the bedrooms, and the newly installed woven wood shade in my office is working great as well.  These blinds are on the pricier side but the quality is excellent and the setup is easy.\n\nOne other note: at first I was using my ADT alarm system as the hub and not Hubitat.  Google Home wouldn't recognize the blinds even though they had been added to ADT successfully. Of ADT, Google, and SmartWings, only the SmartWings customer service rep seemed to have any clue a to what was going on. ADT's response was \"sorry we don't sell that product so I can't help you.\" Google customer support told me to disconnect and reconnect ADT even though I plainly told them that I'd already tried that, and when it still didn't work they said \"oh that's too bad thanks bye.\" Ha. The SmartWings chat rep listened to what was going on and correctly suspected that the ADT controller wasn't properly communicating the presence of the blinds with Google Home. They recommended that I switch my hub to either Google Hub or one of their other supported hubs. I went with Hubitat and now it all works great.\n\nBottom line, SmartWings are solid and easy to set up smart blinds.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I‚Äôm under contract for a new home and will gain access in a couple of weeks. I‚Äôm feeling a tiny bit overwhelmed. I have what I would consider above average tech skills. I‚Äôm a software engineer by trade writing web apps, and I first learned to code on Arduino over a decade ago so I have decent programming and cursory electronics skills (I could install a WiFi relay or something of similar complexity without help). I used to have my whole place set up with WiFi bulbs and a WiFi thermostat connected to google home and do enjoy the benefits of smart home features (though WiFi bulbs were kind of a pain and I‚Äôm excited to control things at the switch instead). \n\nI‚Äôm interested in designing a home automation system throughout the home that far exceeds what I‚Äôve been able to do previously as a renter. Part of that means I want to set up a network rack and run cat 6 cabling throughout the house. I want to make good choices early so I don‚Äôt have to upgrade later, but I‚Äôm having trouble deciding what that means for my project. \n\nThe house is a 4 story townhome in the the middle of a city so I do want some cameras and security features, but I don‚Äôt have a yard, just a 1 car garage. I think maybe having PoE run everywhere is the right way to do it? I have a little bit of an attention deficit and replacing batteries in a bunch of devices is a hassle. \n\nI also need a little advice on how to figure out what‚Äôs already been set up, the house has a Bluetooth speaker system throughout, and there were some digital intercom screens set up in a few rooms but they appeared to be turned off we did the tour/inspection. \n\nThere‚Äôs also the matter of hardware and software choices. I‚Äôve heard great things about the unifi ubiquiti platform and would like to try a nice network setup as a backbone for the project, and I‚Äôm excited to build on an open sourced platform like home assistant. I tried having a conversation with an LLM about hardware and some things like a dedicated firewall seem like overkill? It‚Äôs tough to right size a system without having seen common setups before.\n\nAll of these variables have led me into a bit of an analysis paralysis, I wanted to start home lab-ing a bit in preparation but can‚Äôt decide what parts of the project I can get a head start on or if I should just wait to get the keys. I feel if I wait too long to run the cat6 I might have to do it after our stuff is moved in making things a little harder (I have a month and a half or so of overlap to move), but I figure getting someone out here to do the work twice will cost more so I should figure out how many ports I‚Äôm going to have them drop quickly. \n\nMostly just looking for general advice, tips, or other experiences to learn from on how to properly design and diagram everything and come up with a semblance of a plan going into the new home. Help!",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! üòä)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It‚Äôs not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt want to give up gardening‚Äîespecially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations ‚Äî this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier‚Äôs water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125‚Äì250 m¬≥/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot ‚Äì all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 ‚Äì 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I‚Äôm Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it‚Äôs possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I‚Äôd love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I‚Äôm really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I‚Äôm planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant‚Äôs growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. ‚ÄûThis is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?‚Äú\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can‚Äôt physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It‚Äôs not overkill‚Äîit‚Äôs my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. ‚ÄûThis must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou‚Äôre right, it does. This isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. ‚ÄûIs it still ‚Äögrowing‚Äò if everything is automated?‚Äú\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn‚Äôt just manual labor‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. ‚ÄûWhat happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. ‚ÄûWhy go public with something like this?‚Äú\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it‚Äôs possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. ‚ÄûWhy not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?‚Äú\r\n-\tFor many, that‚Äôs a great option‚Äîbut not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can‚Äôt reach into the tent. It‚Äôs not about convenience; it‚Äôs a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. ‚ÄûDo you have any pictures of the build process itself?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things‚Äîthe automation, the code, and making it accessible‚Äîthat we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚Äöbuild‚Äò for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I‚Äôll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. ‚ÄûHow do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn‚Äôt the power draw a major issue?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot‚Äîa task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7‚Äì4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîit could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like ‚Äûoverkill‚Äú to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn‚Äôt replace my involvement‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn‚Äôt about being lazy; it‚Äôs about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all ‚Äî hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI‚Äôve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won‚Äôt be an issue ‚Äî my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30√ó1.5?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss‚ÜíM30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you‚Äôve used?\n\nWhat I‚Äôve tried / extra info:\n\t‚Ä¢\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay‚Ä¶).\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don‚Äôt seat correctly on several valves.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t‚Ä¢\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t‚Ä¢\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey ‚Äî I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. üôè\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can‚Äôt figure out the chart :(",

I have the fan connected to bond and currently using Smart Things, but I'm having difficulty find a good smart wall switch to easily turn on/off the light and have at least three settings for the fan.  \n\nI'm currently thinking the best option is a controller with just four big buttons that are connect to wifi and can be programed.  This is the closest I've found:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09B6S4TSL/ref=ox\\_sc\\_act\\_image\\_5?smid=A1XO9WGZO0A93O&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09B6S4TSL/ref=ox_sc_act_image_5?smid=A1XO9WGZO0A93O&th=1)\n\nI prefer the appearance of this one, but concerned that the dimming option, especially for the fan, would just reduce power to the fan and cause complications:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086PPRWL7/ref=ox\\_sc\\_act\\_image\\_4?smid=A3U2GPXV9J2W2G&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086PPRWL7/ref=ox_sc_act_image_4?smid=A3U2GPXV9J2W2G&psc=1)\n\nI feel that I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! üòä)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It‚Äôs not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt want to give up gardening‚Äîespecially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations ‚Äî this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier‚Äôs water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125‚Äì250 m¬≥/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot ‚Äì all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 ‚Äì 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I‚Äôm Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it‚Äôs possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I‚Äôd love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I‚Äôm really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I‚Äôm planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant‚Äôs growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. ‚ÄûThis is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?‚Äú\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can‚Äôt physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It‚Äôs not overkill‚Äîit‚Äôs my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. ‚ÄûThis must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou‚Äôre right, it does. This isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. ‚ÄûIs it still ‚Äögrowing‚Äò if everything is automated?‚Äú\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn‚Äôt just manual labor‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. ‚ÄûWhat happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. ‚ÄûWhy go public with something like this?‚Äú\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it‚Äôs possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. ‚ÄûWhy not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?‚Äú\r\n-\tFor many, that‚Äôs a great option‚Äîbut not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can‚Äôt reach into the tent. It‚Äôs not about convenience; it‚Äôs a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. ‚ÄûDo you have any pictures of the build process itself?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things‚Äîthe automation, the code, and making it accessible‚Äîthat we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚Äöbuild‚Äò for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I‚Äôll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. ‚ÄûHow do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn‚Äôt the power draw a major issue?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot‚Äîa task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7‚Äì4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîit could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like ‚Äûoverkill‚Äú to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn‚Äôt replace my involvement‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn‚Äôt about being lazy; it‚Äôs about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all ‚Äî hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI‚Äôve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won‚Äôt be an issue ‚Äî my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30√ó1.5?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss‚ÜíM30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you‚Äôve used?\n\nWhat I‚Äôve tried / extra info:\n\t‚Ä¢\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay‚Ä¶).\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don‚Äôt seat correctly on several valves.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t‚Ä¢\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t‚Ä¢\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey ‚Äî I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. üôè\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can‚Äôt figure out the chart :(",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

    "selftext": "Is or has anyone else thought about doing this? Has anyone done it successfully? \n\nI'd like parts of my home to have lights turn on ONLY when there is a person detected. Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up? Something without a subscription.\n\n  \nAdded request - We're using a really old camera system. I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription.

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm kind of sold on Ecobee brand because our house has two floors and the thermostat mount has to be downstairs so we need the remote temperature sensor capability. The Ecobee premium looks great. However I‚Äôm confused about one thing. On Costco the model number is EB-STATE6VP-01 but on Amazon (and possibly the official Ecobee website) the model number is EB-STATE6-01. I‚Äôm slightly tempted to buy the Costco one because it‚Äôs showing $30 less and is including 2 remote sensors, but I‚Äôm concerned if this is not the same product and lower quality. Can someone shed some light on this please? Thanks in advance!",

The white on the left goes in to the relay (to trigger the central heating), and the white on the right goes from the relay to the boiler. The Black is permanent live to the boiler for hot water.\n\nThe second picture is using WAGO connecters instead of the standard connector, hot water works fine.\n\nThe third picture shows how the relay is wired (there's a piece that plugs in to connect and control). My assumption was that I could just swap that Live/Neutral on the left to the inputs on the ZBMINIR2, and then the Live/Neutral on the right to the outputs, and everything should work.\n\nWith just the inputs, the ZBMINIR2 'works' fine, in that I can see it and toggle it in HomeAssistant. However the issue is that whenever I power the boiler on with the outputs connected, my RCD trips instantly.\n\n  \nHoping for some advice on what I'm doing wrong, because I am perplexed.",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

    "selftext": "My home has a two-gang box w/ two switches on the living room wall, and whatever used to be hooked up to one of the switches was disconnected before I bought it. We mostly use lamps with Hue bulbs in this room and I thought I could replace that dead switch with a remote to toggle a scene in my HomeKit setup instead of futzing with phones or assistants.\n\nThe Hue dimmer does what I want _technically_ but I would love something that fits behind a Decora plate. The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there‚Äôs the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly‚Äôs ‚Äúdetached mode‚Äù almost sounds like what I want, except I don‚Äôt need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there‚Äôs a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I‚Äôm struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the ‚Äúgive me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on‚Äù problem?",

Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

It was completely dry, so I thought, ‚ÄúBetter scrape it off than leave it like this.‚Äù\nAfter scraping it off, the problems started. The computer would boot normally, but after about a minute, the fans would speed up, and shortly after, the screen would go completely black.\n\nSo I bought some new thermal paste. However (most likely while I was replacing it), one of the yellow-and-black wires from the 4-pin connector snapped off. I didn‚Äôt notice it at first ‚Äî after applying the new paste, the PC wouldn‚Äôt power on anymore. It only spun the fans at a constant speed, but nothing else would happen.\n\nLater I noticed that one of those 4-pin wires had come loose. I soldered it back, but nothing changed. Then I replaced it with another cable with about the same wire thickness. After that, the PSU started making a buzzing noise and then completely died.\n\nNow, even with a different PSU, the problem continues ‚Äî in fact, the fans spin even slower now. The replacement PSU is older but stronger, and I tested it yesterday with another device, and it worked fine, so the issue isn‚Äôt the new PSU.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n(Also, I didn‚Äôt use any custom cables ‚Äî I‚Äôm using the ones that came with the power supply itself.)\nAlso I used ChatGPT to translate because it's really hard to translate this whole story",

    "selftext": "This isn‚Äôt exactly a tech support problem, more of a curiosity thing.\n\nI have an Asus K6502ZC with a Core i5-12450H and a mobile RTX 3050 4 GB. The laptop shipped with a single PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe drive. I installed a second PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe, and GPU-Z shows the RTX 3050 running at PCIe 4.0 x8. Even after removing the second NVMe drive, GPU-Z still reports the GPU at x8 Gen4 (even in GPU-Z render test).\n\nFrom what I understand, the 12450H has 28 PCIe lanes, which should be enough for a x16 dGPU plus a x4 NVMe, with lanes to spare. I‚Äôm not sure how the CPU and PCH are wired in this model, but I expected the dGPU to run at x16.\n\nMy question: is the mobile RTX 3050 in the K6502ZC permanently wired for PCIe 4.0 x8 regardless of storage configuration, or is there another reason it stays at x8 even with only one NVMe installed?\n\nPerformance isn‚Äôt the concern here, I know a mobile 3050 won‚Äôt saturate x16, a mobile 3050 will still suck. I‚Äôm just trying to understand why it reports x8 Gen4 regardless of whether the second NVMe is installed. Is the GPU wired as x8 by design on this model, or is there something else going on with lane allocation/power states?",

Once it loads the folder, if I go up a few levels and then re-open it, Explorer hangs again. \n\nI have tried renaming the song files to remove all characters with accent marks, redownloaded the files, renamed the folder, restarted my computer, ran \"sfc /scannow\" just in case there was some weird corruption going on somewhere, but have had no luck with anything. Windows is fully up to date, drivers are fully up to date, and I've never experienced this before. \n\nOther albums from the same band on the same hard drive open just fine, it's just this specific album for some reason. I run a media server on this drive and have zero issues with the other ~10tb of files and folders. My music is *not* synced to my media server or anything else, just manually synced to MusicBee (which does recognize and play the files fine) so nothing else should be accessing the folder.\n\nI'm at a complete loss on how to fix this, and a web search just brings up endless AI generated garbage websites that aren't helpful.

As per the logs there is no temperature hotspots, I have also repasted CPU, cleaned fans and even repasted the GPU.\n\nSome additional observations :\n\n* The issue tends to happen during AAA Gaming. I completed Silksong and Hades 2, and didn't face a single crash.\n* The issue also tends to resolve itself for a month or two, and there is no crash at all.\n* When the issue does show up, it is consistent. Post a crash restart, I can boot into the game and it will crash after minutes (even during non trivial screens like level up menu)\n* Keeping the PC off for a day or two, alleviates the issue for a little bit. This is could be just incidental or wrong observation.\n\nMy best guess is it is due to the power draw, though not sure how to check that in HWInfo. I believe the issue might have started after upgrading from 5600X to 5900X. Though its hard to be sure, and I don't believe my setup should exceed the 750w Draw during gaming.\n\nThe other might be related to static build up, but again it should also cause crash during idle. My PC tends to be on 24x7 for Jellyfin and laziness, so it should have been noticed then.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated, since this has driven me insane over the past year.",

I have no idea what to do at this point and I am in desperate need of my PC for uni as I'm a games student. \n\nSpecifications \n\nCPU - AMD Ryzen 5 3500X 6-Core Processor (3.59 GHz)\n\nGPU - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 (4GB)\n\nRAM - 16GB \n\nI am hoping to upgrade my CPU as I realise my build is out of date but I have to wait for Christmas to hopefully get some money towards it. GPU is gonna get upgraded when I can save enough. \n\nUPDATE: Looking at my system info its saying I have 0GB of storage? if this is the issue I currently have no idea how to fix this and I am currently frantically Googling.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read my plea for help and any advice is greatly appreciated.

    "selftext": "Please help me find a resolution for my work PC setup, as I've had this intermittent issue ongoing for nearly four full years that I have been employed at this company.\n\nI'm a remote worker that was given a laptop (Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G2), a Lenovo docking station, and two external LG monitors (slightly mismatched models) as my setup back in 2022. One monitor connected via HDMI, the other with DP because those are the cables they sent.\n\nFrom 2022 until this year, I have had to open at least one ticket per year regarding this issue. In the earlier years the display would work for several months before intermittently flickering like a cable was lose, despite swapping cables and confirming solid connections.\n\nThe most recent progression with this issue is that unplugging and plugging the monitor back in does not even provide temporary relief.\n\nPreviously with the flickering the display cable could be \"jiggled\" to refresh the connection for some hours/weeks/months but for the last 3 weeks one of my monitors has not been getting signal at all.\n\nHelpdesk has performed many steps including:\n\n* Updating docking station firmware (this seemed to help for some weeks, but issues always returned)\n* Replaced original Lenovo docking station with new, same model (issue persists)\n* Sent two additional matching LG monitors for me to try (issue persists)\n* Sent a new HP docking station (issue persists)\n* Sent a new HP EliteBook (issue persists)\n\nI have personally tried:\n\n* Swapping cables around, using known-good cables (issue persists)\n* Swapping docking station ports (issue persists)\n\nBut most recently: \n\n* Plugged in an HP Chromebook C640 (ISSUE DOES NOT PERSIST ON CHROMEBOOK)\n\nGuys... what the hell is going on? My helpdesk people have been stringing me along with temporary fixes for almost four years now and I'd love to just have a working setup.\n\nthanks!",

I thought, ‚ÄúPerfect ‚Äî good company name, stable role, and near family.‚Äù But today I came across a Google review (as given below üëá) that completely ruined my excitement.\n\n*********************[[[[[[[\nAmway Madurai IT Contract: Toxic &\nUnprofessional - O/5, Avoid\nPlant: Immaculate, disciplined.\nIT Team: Politics-driven chaos, manipulation over merit.

Choose better environments.\n\n]]]]]*********************\n\n\nThe review described the Amway Madurai IT team as toxic, unprofessional, politics-driven, and even named people with bad behavior.

I don‚Äôt want to regret my decision later ‚Äî either by choosing stability and getting stuck, or by moving away and struggling in an unstable startup.\n\nIf anyone here has worked in Amway Madurai IT or faced something similar ‚Äî please share your thoughts.\nHow do you usually decide between comfort (near home) and potential growth (far away)?\n\nAny honest advice or personal experiences would really help me right now. üôè",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI have been having issues for the last few weeks that have me pulling my hair out. Whenever I start my PC up, I will get an error code that causes a restart. This will repeat with a different error each time. Eventually, after like 3 or 4 cycles of this, I'll finally be able to get in, and then everything seems to work just fine. It usually crashes right as I'm signing into Windows, but sometimes it'll just freeze, and I'll have to do a hard shutoff. Once it starts up, there are usually no issues, but very rarely it will let me in but still crash within the first 30 second of using it. It consistently takes multiple attempts and never starts up without an error on the first attempt. \n\nThis started happening after I changed my CPU from an i7-12700k to an i5-14600k, but I don't recall it happening for the first week or two. I have reset Windows (the option that keeps my files). Windows is fully updated, the BIOS is updated, and I have tried to update all drivers I can think of. MemTest86 didn't detect any issues, and neither did Prime95. None of the various troubleshooters have detected anything, either. \n\nI have uploaded the minidumps I've collected in the last week below. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!\n\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/26xf6udpftl9nve/Minidump.zip/file",

    "selftext": "To preface, I have a 3080 FTW Ultra that I got in early 2021 powered by a SF750 SFX.\n\nSo I had been running FanControl for a while to run a fan profile on my case fans / GPU, but I guess a recent update had knocked out its ability to read sensor data correctly. Last Thursday while playing BF6 for idk an hour or so, one match I went to load into and my screen went blank but discord etc remained working. I tried win+shift+ctrl+b to reset the driver and it did nothing, so I had to hard restart the computer. When it rebooted, there was a windows update (of course) and then I noticed there was an nvidia driver update dated Oct 14 that was available so I downloaded it, and resumed gaming.\n\nThe next day, while playing some BF6 again I could hear my fans running like crazy, opened up fancontrol and saw the notification indicating the sensor reading issue and that it needed an update to allow it to properly read sensor data - fancontrol said my GPU was at like idk 45C but HWinfo had it at 88C, the hotspot was around 100C, I have no clue what it was while running BF6 since I had quit the game immediately when I heard the fans. Updated fan control, redid my fan curves and then launched BF6 again and it was fine. I played Valorant a bit later and was fine. In hindsight I have no clue what temps were when i initially had the first black screen, I‚Äôm unsure if the computer would have just shut off to prevent it from melting entirely or crashing the display driver and stop working would be the way it would handle overheating.\n\nSaturday I had gamed for a lil with zero issues, but then yesterday evening, I launched BF6, sat in the menu and then upon joining a game, black screen. I launched OCCT to try and stress test, black screen again. Mind you the rest of the computer appears to work, just no video output. Restarted, opened MSI afterburner and tried UV a tiny bit (used to have a nice UV for a long while but the profile got deleted on an update maybe sometime in August, didn‚Äôt really worry about redoing it and dialing it in again. Reduced power limit to 90% to see if maybe it was a PSU issue, ran a power test and it was fine, ran the VGA test and it threw an error but I didn‚Äôt get a black screen so I assumed the UV was maybe a tad unstable or something. Launched valorant while my friends were playing, sat in the menu, went to the range and did several rounds and when they were ready I joined their group and the moment it found a match and went to switch screens, black screen again‚Ä¶\n\nSo I took the GPU out, I have no clue what I‚Äôm looking at/for, but I noticed my thermal pads I‚Äôm assuming on my VRMs had melted sometime before last night, I‚Äôd only assume it could have been last Thursday but I‚Äôve had this card for several years (normally under load it would be ~60C or less).\n\nIm assuming thermal pads don‚Äôt melt unless it sustains some bad temps.  Am I cooked, would replacing the thermal pads and putting paste on the GPU even be worth it?  Here is a [a photo of the VRMS and board](https://postimg.cc/HJPsM8hv). I‚Äôm nervous that repeated issues could be causing power spikes / instability and potentially damage my PSU as well.\n\nAnyone out there who could maybe help?",

    "selftext": "First of all i write this with the help of ChapGTP cause english its not my main  language  \n\n\nHello everyone, I'm facing a very strange and frustrating issue with a new SSD, and I could really use some expert advice.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nI bought a **Samsung 990 Evo Plus 2TB** M.2 SSD during the recent Amazon sales. I installed it in the **M2\\_2 slot** of my **MSI B650 Gaming Plus WiFi** motherboard.\n\nInitially, it works fine. I can format it and install games. However, as soon as the drive is put under **any significant load** (e.g., running a game installed on it for 2-3 hours, or attempting a performance test in Samsung Magician), the drive completely crashes.\n\n**The Symptoms:**\n\n1. The drive suddenly appears as **RAW** in Windows Disk Management.\n2. I cannot format the drive, delete the volume, or interact with it at all.\n3. It disappears from utilities like CrystalDiskInfo, but often still shows up in Samsung Magician.\n\n**The Bizarre \"Fix\":**\n\nThe strange part is that **a simple PC restart completely resolves the issue.** After a reboot, the drive reappears, is properly formatted (NTFS), and is fully accessible again, as if nothing happened. I can then reinstall files, only for the issue to repeat under load.\n\n  \n**What I've Done So Far:**\n\n1. **RMA/Replacement:** I initially thought the SSD was faulty, so I RMA'd it with Amazon and received a brand new replacement. **The new drive has the exact same problem.**\n2. **Slot:** The SSD is currently in the **M2\\_2 slot**. The **M2\\_1 slot** is occupied by my boot drive (another M.2 SSD, which works perfectly).\n\n**My Hypothesis & Next Steps:**\n\n* It doesn't seem to be the SSD itself since the replacement failed identically.\n* I suspect the **M2\\_2 slot** on the motherboard might be defective or improperly supplying power/data under continuous load, but the fact that a simple restart \"fixes\" it temporarily is confusing. If the port were broken, I'd expect it to not show up at all.\n* I have purchased a **PCIe M.2 adapter** to test the drive in a standard PCIe slot.\n\nHas anyone with a B650 board experienced similar issues with the secondary M.2 slots? Could this be a **power delivery issue**, a **chipset/driver bug**, or something specific to the **M2\\_2 slot** on this motherboard model?\n\nAny advice on diagnostics or potential BIOS settings to check would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!  \n\n\n\n\n  \n",

Here‚Äôs the full story in chronological order.\n\nüïê 2019 ‚Äì Early 2020\n\nLaptop worked great for the first ~6 months.\n\nHeavy gaming (Apex Legends, etc.) pushed GPU temps to 80‚Äì85 ¬∞C.\n\nThe display would suddenly go black, sound would freeze, and I had to force shutdown.\n\nAfter cooling down, it would boot normally again.\n\nLag when plugged in: Occasionally, since purchase, performance would drop badly until I unplugged and re-plugged the charger, then FPS would instantly recover.\n\nüßπ Mid 2020 ‚Äì 2021\n\nFound dust clogging the cooling system; cleaned it thoroughly.\n\nTemps improved and random shutdowns reduced.\n\nAround 2021, HP UEFI Diagnostics flagged a ‚ÄúVideo Memory [F] failure‚Äù ‚Üí confirmed early VRAM instability on the GPU.\n\nFrom this point onward, the GPU remained functional but unstable under high load.\n\n‚ö° 2022 ‚Äì 2024\n\nContinued gaming on medium settings; GPU stayed below 78 ¬∞C.\n\nOccasional driver crashes or screen flickers.\n\nNo major shutdowns, but instability kept creeping back.\n\nüîã 2025\n\nHP Smart reported a ‚Äúblown charge-state fuse‚Äù ‚Äî battery stopped charging completely. Removed the battery since this. I get CMOS error and I press enter to see boot (hp omen logo).\n\nBegan using the laptop plugged in only, like a desktop.\n\nThe power button started blinking continuously even during normal operation ‚Üí likely due to the battery-circuit fault.\n\nSystem still booted and worked fine on AC.\n\nüí• Current State (2025 October)\n\nThe internal laptop display stays black most of the time (backlight faintly glows).\n\nExternal 200 Hz monitor (HDMI) works well ‚Äî I can even play Apex Legends for hours on medium settings with GPU VRAM capped to 4 GB.\n\n\nNVIDIA Control Panel won‚Äôt open, though the RTX 2070 is visible in Device Manager and Task Manager.\n\nBoot behavior:\n\nExternal monitor connected via HDMI.\n\nPress power ‚Üí CMOS error occurs(sometimes it wont be displayed in either of the displays, occurs when I start the laptop after a long time, like half a day etc) (I press enter to proceed with booting, as one can see if windows is booted or not by pressing caps lock to see if the button lights are working or not) \n\nWhat happens next in a successful boot is, the powee button light goes off and turns on in like 2 sec, I press entee agan and the same cycle happens for one more time (2 to 3 timez at max), and then the external display connected (sometimes internal display too) gets hp omen logo boot screen. Post this, if windows login acreen comes, in atleast one of the displays, it is a successful boot. Else, I have to force shutdown the pc and start again\n\nSystem reboots itself once or twice.\n\nHP Omen logo appears ‚Äî almost always on the external monitor.\n\nDisplay outcomes (approx. 10 boots):\n\n5 times ‚Üí only external monitor shows the Windows login screen, laptop panel stays blank.\n\n1 time ‚Üí both monitors work correctly and internal 144 Hz panel shows Windows login.\n\n4 times ‚Üí internal panel = black, external = HP logo only (no Windows output). I can still log in blindly and shut down via Alt + F4, so the system is running headless.\n\nWhen I try to ‚ÄúDuplicate display,‚Äù both displays drop to 1024√ó768 @ 60 Hz, the only modes Windows detects for the laptop screen.\n\nüîé Current Symptoms Summary\n\nGPU and HDMI output work reliably; internal panel almost dead.\n\nCMOS error on every cold boot ‚Üí BIOS resets device detection.\n\nHP Diagnostics previously confirmed Video Memory failure.\n\nüí≠ My Suspicions\n\nPartial GPU VRAM degradation or faulty eDP (output to internal panel).\n\nPossible loose or damaged eDP cable/panel connector.\n\nWeak CMOS battery causing repeated re-detection and boot loops.\n\nBattery-charging fuse blown (confirmed), forcing AC-only operation.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è What Still Works\n\nExternal monitor gaming at 200 Hz for hours.\n\nAll USB, audio, and Ethernet functions.\n\nInternal panel sometimes returns to life for one boot, then fails again.\n\n‚ùìLooking for Advice\n\nHas anyone seen an RTX-series GPU that works fine externally but fails internally?\n\nCould a failing VRAM or eDP transmitter cause intermittent CMOS errors?\n\nIs a GPU reball worth it on this board (L50873-006), or should I hunt for a replacement motherboard?\n\nAny way to disable the internal panel entirely to speed up boot?\n\nAny insights or similar experiences would really help.\nThanks for reading ‚Äî posting this so future Omen owners facing half-dead GPUs can find a full timeline too.",

    "selftext": "I recently noticed a sudden increase in my 3090 FE temps, my card was running at 86¬∞C under load when it used to run at around 74¬∞C before. I decided to change the thermal paste and also repad it while I'm at it, so I ordered some Gelid Extreme 1.5mm pads and Thermalright TFX thermal paste. After repadding the card and putting some new thermal paste, here were the results:\n\nGPU Temp: 86¬∞C / VRAM Temp: 90¬∞C\n\nI reopened the card to see what's going on. I pressed on the pads to make them thinner, reapplied thermal paste and made sure to remount the leaf spring in a cross pattern with even torque. Here were the results:\n\nGPU Temp: 86¬∞C / VRAM Temp: 95¬∞C\n\nI reopened the card again. This time I change the thermal paste with some Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut. I also tried to make the pads as thin as possible. After remounting the cards the same way as before, here were the results:\n\nGPU Temp: 84¬∞C / VRAM Temp: 100¬∞C\n\nSome progress with the GPU temp but the VRAM temp was getting worse, make the pads thinner probably made them less effective. So I ordered some Gelid Extreme 1mm pads. After replacing the pads and repasting the GPU with the same thermal paste, here are the results:\n\nGPU Temp: 88¬∞C / VRAM Temp: 110¬∞C\n\nI'm really confused about what's going on there...",

I found some [residential proxies](https://infatica.io/residential-proxies/) online going for around $3 per IP, which seemed like a pretty good price, but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre reliable or if I‚Äôd get throttled.\n\nDoes anyone here have experience using both for this kind of stuff? Is it worth paying for residential proxies for small projects or should I just stick with a good VPN? I‚Äôm not super technical so I want something simple to set up too.",

One monitor connected via HDMI, the other with DP because those are the cables they sent.\n\nFrom 2022 until this year, I have had to open at least one ticket per year regarding this issue. In the earlier years the display would work for several months before intermittently flickering like a cable was lose, despite swapping cables and confirming solid connections.\n\nThe most recent progression with this issue is that unplugging and plugging the monitor back in does not even provide temporary relief.\n\nPreviously with the flickering the display cable could be \"jiggled\" to refresh the connection for some hours/weeks/months but for the last 3 weeks one of my monitors has not been getting signal at all.\n\nHelpdesk has performed many steps including:\n\n* Updating docking station firmware (this seemed to help for some weeks, but issues always returned)\n* Replaced original Lenovo docking station with new, same model (issue persists)\n* Sent two additional matching LG monitors for me to try (issue persists)\n* Sent a new HP docking station (issue persists)\n* Sent a new HP EliteBook (issue persists)\n\nI have personally tried:\n\n* Swapping cables around, using known-good cables (issue persists)\n* Swapping docking station ports (issue persists)\n\nBut most recently: \n\n* Plugged in an HP Chromebook C640 (ISSUE DOES NOT PERSIST ON CHROMEBOOK)\n\nGuys... what the hell is going on? My helpdesk people have been stringing me along with temporary fixes for almost four years now and I'd love to just have a working setup.\n\nthanks!",

I‚Äôm just trying to understand why it reports x8 Gen4 regardless of whether the second NVMe is installed. Is the GPU wired as x8 by design on this model, or is there something else going on with lane allocation/power states?",

    "selftext": "I have a folder of an album with 8 MP3s that I just downloaded from a band's website. On the drive I downloaded it to, it unzipped and opened fine and I'm able to play all of the songs no problem. However, if I move or copy the folder to another HDD, Windows Explorer stops responding when I open the folder and it takes about 15 minutes for it to recover and display the contents. Once it loads the folder, if I go up a few levels and then re-open it, Explorer hangs again. \n\nI have tried renaming the song files to remove all characters with accent marks, redownloaded the files, renamed the folder, restarted my computer, ran \"sfc /scannow\" just in case there was some weird corruption going on somewhere, but have had no luck with anything. Windows is fully up to date, drivers are fully up to date, and I've never experienced this before. \n\nOther albums from the same band on the same hard drive open just fine, it's just this specific album for some reason. I run a media server on this drive and have zero issues with the other ~10tb of files and folders. My music is *not* synced to my media server or anything else, just manually synced to MusicBee (which does recognize and play the files fine) so nothing else should be accessing the folder.\n\nI'm at a complete loss on how to fix this, and a web search just brings up endless AI generated garbage websites that aren't helpful. It's not the end of the world if I can't open the folder, but it is super strange, and I just want to make sure this isn't a sign of some other issue with the drive. \n\nBecause this music is available for free from their website [here's a link](https://dubioza.org/music/agrikultura/) in case anyone feels like trying to replicate the issue (or wants to listen to some awesome Bulkan ska for free). \n\nPC specs:\nWindows 11 Pro 24H2\nCPU: Ryzen 5800x3D\nRAM: 128gb\nGPU: Radeon 7900XT\nHDD file was downloaded to: WD Blue 4tb\nHDD file was moved to: WD Red 16tb",

As per the logs there is no temperature hotspots, I have also repasted CPU, cleaned fans and even repasted the GPU.\n\nSome additional observations :\n\n* The issue tends to happen during AAA Gaming. I completed Silksong and Hades 2, and didn't face a single crash.\n* The issue also tends to resolve itself for a month or two, and there is no crash at all.\n* When the issue does show up, it is consistent. Post a crash restart, I can boot into the game and it will crash after minutes (even during non trivial screens like level up menu)\n* Keeping the PC off for a day or two, alleviates the issue for a little bit. This is could be just incidental or wrong observation.\n\nMy best guess is it is due to the power draw, though not sure how to check that in HWInfo. I believe the issue might have started after upgrading from 5600X to 5900X. Though its hard to be sure, and I don't believe my setup should exceed the 750w Draw during gaming.\n\nThe other might be related to static build up, but again it should also cause crash during idle. My PC tends to be on 24x7 for Jellyfin and laziness, so it should have been noticed then.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated, since this has driven me insane over the past year.",

Not long ago, I bought and assembled a computer: an RTX 5070 TUF Gaming graphics card, an MSI B650 Gaming Plus motherboard, a Ryzen 7 7700 processor, a tower Deepcool AK620, and a Chieftec ATMOS 850W power supply. After I started playing games, I encountered a problem: the processor heats up to 95 degrees Celsius, sometimes even slightly exceeding that temperature. Is this okay or not?",

    "selftext": "Hi bit of a long one. I've had my PC for years and I was on windows 7 the free version. Pc worked great but over the years I'd gained many many files and wanted to reset it all and wipe it to start fresh. \n\nwhen I went home over the summer (I'm a uni student) I got my dad (who initially built the pc) to reset it for me and install windows 11 (a dodgy pirate key because he doesn't believe in paying for anything and doesn't value my opinions) Ever since the reset everything has gone down hill. \n\nIt started with the PC just being really slow and freezing for 10-15 seconds and as time went on I started getting crashes and my PC booting up and saying oops there is an issue. \n\nI've only just started learning about PCs this last year because of my uni course and doing stuff myself but this is everything I've done to try fix it in order. \n\n-- Unplugged all extensions and plugged in stuff - turned off pc and removed power cable - left for ten minutes - turned back on and slowly added back all the extensions and plugins like dongles. \n\n-- Uninstalled the dodgy windows and got an actual key (on sale cause I'm a broke student) \n\n-- Checked my pc physically to ensure everything was connected correctly and no hardware had become loose (as I moved accommodation) \n\n-- Windows failed to access my account after a fault so I lost everything so I did a system restore to get everyback \n\n-- Total reset with removing files which took all this weekend --- (Pc so far hasn't crashed since but is very slow) \n\n-- Ensured all windows updates were installed and checked that all drivers (CPU & GPU mainly) were up to date \n\nSince the total reset I've had no crashes or problems booting up the pc but some apps just won't open and even opening the settings takes 10 years and freezes. I have no idea what to do at this point and I am in desperate need of my PC for uni as I'm a games student. \n\nSpecifications \n\nCPU - AMD Ryzen 5 3500X 6-Core Processor (3.59 GHz)\n\nGPU - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 (4GB)\n\nRAM - 16GB \n\nI am hoping to upgrade my CPU as I realise my build is out of date but I have to wait for Christmas to hopefully get some money towards it. GPU is gonna get upgraded when I can save enough. \n\nUPDATE: Looking at my system info its saying I have 0GB of storage? if this is the issue I currently have no idea how to fix this and I am currently frantically Googling.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read my plea for help and any advice is greatly appreciated.

The laptop shipped with a single PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe drive. I installed a second PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe, and GPU-Z shows the RTX 3050 running at PCIe 4.0 x8. Even after removing the second NVMe drive, GPU-Z still reports the GPU at x8 Gen4 (even in GPU-Z render test).\n\nFrom what I understand, the 12450H has 28 PCIe lanes, which should be enough for a x16 dGPU plus a x4 NVMe, with lanes to spare. I‚Äôm not sure how the CPU and PCH are wired in this model, but I expected the dGPU to run at x16.\n\nMy question: is the mobile RTX 3050 in the K6502ZC permanently wired for PCIe 4.0 x8 regardless of storage configuration, or is there another reason it stays at x8 even with only one NVMe installed?\n\nPerformance isn‚Äôt the concern here, I know a mobile 3050 won‚Äôt saturate x16, a mobile 3050 will still suck. I‚Äôm just trying to understand why it reports x8 Gen4 regardless of whether the second NVMe is installed. Is the GPU wired as x8 by design on this model, or is there something else going on with lane allocation/power states?",

Once it loads the folder, if I go up a few levels and then re-open it, Explorer hangs again. \n\nI have tried renaming the song files to remove all characters with accent marks, redownloaded the files, renamed the folder, restarted my computer, ran \"sfc /scannow\" just in case there was some weird corruption going on somewhere, but have had no luck with anything. Windows is fully up to date, drivers are fully up to date, and I've never experienced this before. \n\nOther albums from the same band on the same hard drive open just fine, it's just this specific album for some reason. I run a media server on this drive and have zero issues with the other ~10tb of files and folders. My music is *not* synced to my media server or anything else, just manually synced to MusicBee (which does recognize and play the files fine) so nothing else should be accessing the folder.\n\nI'm at a complete loss on how to fix this, and a web search just brings up endless AI generated garbage websites that aren't helpful.
