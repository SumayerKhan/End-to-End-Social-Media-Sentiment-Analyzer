    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn‚Äôt an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn‚Äôt have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid.

    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "title": "Added height ruler to my iOS photogrammetry app",
    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "title": "Added height ruler to my iOS photogrammetry app",
    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

Each shortcut might save two seconds, but those seconds compound into minutes of reclaimed focus.\nThe beauty of iOS is that most of its real power hides in plain sight.

    "selftext": "Scroll to bottom for the fix that worked for me!\n\nHey folks, just wanting to make this post in case anyone else goes through the same issues both my partner and myself were dealing with. We wasted way too much time on the phone with both our carrier (Verizon) and Apple support with no real solution from them, and also trying all sorts of different fixes mentioned online. \n\nNot sure if this is an issue specifically with certain carriers, or the new iPhones/new IOS version. In my case specifically, we were porting our lines from T-Mobile over to Verizon, along with activating two new iPhone 17s. After going through the process, we both noticed our iMessage and FaceTime were not working. Verizon did tell us it might take anywhere from 30 minutes, to an hour for it to start working properly, but it didn‚Äôt. Waited a couple hours, still nothing. To keep it brief, we called Verizon support and they had us do all sorts of things as it seemed like they might not have ever seen this issue before. \n\nThey had us restart the phone, turn iMessage and FaceTime on/off, reset network settings, turn off stolen device protection, remove phone number and primary email from Apple account, delete eSIM and try a new one, sign in and out of Apple account on phone, a whole bunch of different things. None of which worked. Incidentally, once the primary email was removed, Apple wasn‚Äôt allowing us to re-add the primary email so there‚Äôs another issue there. But that‚Äôs for a different time. \n\nAnyway, after trying every trick in the book, Verizon‚Äôs suggestion was to wait 24 hours, and reach out to Apple if iMessage still wasn‚Äôt working. Being impatient, and wanting our new phones to work out of the box, like literally every other phone I‚Äôve ever owned, we reached out to Apple. \n\nApples suggestion was to leave iMessage and FaceTime alone (don‚Äôt keep turning it on/off, and don‚Äôt reboot the phone as this restarts the verification timer/process every time) and wait 24 hours. Based on what I‚Äôve seen online, that may, or may not work for some people, so I wasn‚Äôt too happy with that response. Just cross my fingers and hope one of the primary features of my iPhone works in 24 hours. \n\nAfter going crazy trying to find a solution, I figured I‚Äôd just give it the time they suggested but even then it still wasn‚Äôt working. So once again, I was trying anything and everything to get it working. Now for the trick that worked for me! \n\nThere are similar variations of what I did mentioned online and in other Reddit posts, but none exactly like what I did. \n\n\nMy Fix: \n\n1. Go to settings -> Apps -> iMessage \n\n2. Turn off iMessage\n\n3. Turn on airplane mode, make sure you aren‚Äôt connected to WiFi \n\n4. Turn on iMessage\n\n5. Directly under the on/off switch you should see ‚ÄúSend & Receive‚Äù. Go into that. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll see your phone number and email address you can use with iMessage. If your number isn‚Äôt working like me, there should be no blue check mark next to your number. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to get, that blue check mark. \n\n6. While still in the ‚ÄúSend & Receive‚Äù tab, turn off airplane mode. Once my phone started connecting to my carrier, a circular loading icon appeared next to my phone number. This is what actually allowed the verification to go through, and get that check next to my phone number. Yay iMessage and FaceTime working as they should! \n\n\nAll the other variations of this I tried, resulted in the phone telling me there was an issue with the activation without even trying to do anything. Just an immediate error message. Doing it the way I did, actually seemed to allow the process to do what it needed to do without erroring out instantly. Hope this helps anyone out there with these same issues! \n",

Based on everything I read online, if I kept it marked as stolen and in my account then they wouldn't be able to do anything with the phone and it would be useless to them, and they wouldn't be able to access any info from the phone.\n\nYesterday I received this text, which oddly enough I never received to my phone, I can only see it on iMessages on my Macbook. They must have been able to find my number somehow though. I am worried about them accessing my photos, bank info, etc. What is the best way to proceed without them getting access to my personal info, if they even can?\n\n",

They quoted me a price which seemed right for what I needed to get done, but then they said, \"it is against apples policy to do \\_\\_ parts\" replacement, you pay the fee, we take your phone, and give u a new phone of the exact same model. this seemed a bit weird because I havent seen apple saying its against their policy to do mattery replacements anywhere(it rhymes with mattery the part im talking about). and they also said theres no guarantee or warranty or anything. not even a 90 day guarantee for the part. just a bit puzzled on what to do here. on one hand they are kinda my only option. on the other hand im wondering whether they just made up that \"apple doesnt do mattery replacements they replace the entire phone\" thing",

    "selftext": "Wanted to document my first anniversary of the apple ecosystem. Been a hard core user since the early Samsung galaxy days - S2, Note 4, S5, S7 edge, S10+, S22, S8 tab and all the accessories  (you get my point) \n\nFinally got pressured to change after the Mrs needed to airdrop me photos on honeymoon last Christmas.\n\nSummary - Really questioning why didn't I made the switch earlier but also a ton of things I've taken for granted in the Android world.\n\n\nPros \n1. FaceID - My God this alone should have been apple's branding. Every other device sucks at this and have consistently unreliable. The reliability has been my my authentication in all aspects with the phone from banking to emails to passwords and various logins so much more efficiently. Samsung fingerprints and facial recognition used to hang half the time or fail for me.\n\n2. Apple pay - need I say more. Various ecommerce partners and the reach vs Google/Samsung pay.\n\n3. Airpods instant connection - need I say more. Samsung buds failed me half the time and have a thousand diff apps and interfaces to get something done.\n\n4. Seamless interface with iPad /Apple 4K. Later purchases but they have proven to be a seamless experience. Especially with airdrop and mirroring.\n\n5. Photos just look so much better - ironically Samsung has better cameras but smth about a iphone photos taken makes them so easy and quality worthy to post \n\n6. Apps made for iPhone specifically interface wise - android apps used to be all over the place for me and cameras on apps just weren't as good as the native app which was frustrating.\n\n7. Shortcuts and automation - I know android ecosystem has this as well but ios just made it so much more accessible.\n\nCons\n1. File system - I feel dumb and handicapped by something as simple as a drag and drop. Why are photos on files not on my photos app and require a duplicate action to have it on my photos app. \n\n2. Photos can't be managed and sent as a folder. Photo folders or indexing are an absolutely nightmare. I can't airdrop a folder.\n\n3. Keyboard sucks ass - seriously android converts would know. I've usd SwiftKey but the touches are still bad.\n\n4. Notification - pull down screen is useless and I can't toggle notifications for app phone use unless I go into individual apps to manage each of them.\n\n5. Widgets are terrible and the lack of customisations is such a pain in the arse (I know this might be a developer issue)\n\n6. Every useful app that used to be free on android is now a pay only feature. \n\n7. Can I just know how much longer I need to charge my phone?\n\n8. Home screen customisation feels so handicapped (I know some might thing it's a feature)\n\nIn summary - faceid and airpods seamless connection would have been sufficient for me to make a change based off productively alone. But the lack of certain basic features I was used to in the Android space made it so frustrating at times.\n\nWould love to hear any tips and tricks to improve my experience especially from converts!\n\nMy daily driver is no an iphone 16p and iPad mini for the occasional functional needs. Media still mostly via the Samsung tablet for me.\n",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n‚Äã\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "selftext": "I was just wondering how long most people actually keep their iPhones before upgrading. I‚Äôve seen folks still using the iPhone X or even older ones that work perfectly fine while others can‚Äôt resist upgrading every single year.\nHonestly, I feel like iPhones can easily last 4 to 6 years if you take good care of them. The hardware holds up and Apple keeps pushing updates for quite a while. But it also makes me think should Apple stop selling older Pro models sooner or is it better that they keep them around for people who don‚Äôt want to spend a fortune on the latest one?\n\nSo, how old is your iPhone, and how is it holding up these days?",

The hard drive arrived today, but when I tried to restore from my backup, it said \"no backups available.\" It has over 400GB of photos. 3u Tools encrypts the backup, so I can't open the files manually.

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point üòÖ, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol üòÖ)",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course). I would LOVE if google would implement Android XR in Android. I dont mind my phone getting hot but I wouldn't have to sync my photos and all of that.",

You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

I‚Äôve been working on something I‚Äôm really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It‚Äôs a great feature, but it‚Äôs locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built¬†**MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to¬†**any Android phone running Android 9 or above**¬†‚Äî including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt‚Äôs still in early access and I‚Äôd love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper)¬†\n\nThis is just the beginning - I‚Äôm actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you‚Äôre into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I‚Äôd really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre‚Äôs report clearly mentioned ‚ÄúDisplay ‚Äì step mark on display.‚Äù\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called ‚Äúflagship quality‚Äù completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care ‚Äî never dropped, always in Samsung‚Äôs original case and protector ‚Äî yet the display failed twice. It‚Äôs shocking how a premium device costing nearly ‚Çπ1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite ‚Äî big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you‚Äôre left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand‚Äôs promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "selftext": "It's too much of a coincidence that ONEPLUS has not only downgraded the camera specs but also ditched Hassleblad partnership while OPPO is going all out with strong focus on camera and overall specs/features with the Find X9 series. Oneplus could have just as easily kept the same camera hardware in OP15 as OP13 which would have been good enough for 2026 with proper tuning but they didn't.\n\nAlso, from the display specs the focus is mostly on performance and high refresh rates now.\n\nOneplus flagships are known for VFM with balanced specs but from now on I think the focus is shifting towards to performance/gaming so basically it's minus -1 point from the camera department and +1 point in the performance department.\n\nI strongly believe, from now on ONEPLUS is likely to become a gaming orientated brand and OPPO will be the main balanced brand like IQOO and VIVO, POCO/REDMI and XIAOMI.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEdit: Appending the camera downgrade info below\n\nMain camera: LYT 808 ‚Üí LYT 700 (same as Nord5)\n\nTelephoto: OV64B ‚Üí JN5",

I‚Äôve been working on something I‚Äôm really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It‚Äôs a great feature, but it‚Äôs locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built¬†**MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to¬†**any Android phone running Android 9 or above**¬†‚Äî including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt‚Äôs still in early access and I‚Äôd love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper)¬†\n\nThis is just the beginning - I‚Äôm actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you‚Äôre into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I‚Äôd really appreciate your input.",

This was the closest applicable sub I could find. \n\nThe nearest physical Google store is 6 hours away, and over 700 miles round trip.  I was in that town this weekend, bought a Fold 10 and a Zagg clear case. I wanted the Google branded case, but the in store rep sold me on the Zagg.   \nAfter a day of using it (we were home by then) It's clear that the Zagg case is so very thick that I can't reliably swipe up or \"in\" (back) on the front screen.   \nI started a return with Google, and it got \"hung up\" in the \"waiting for shipping information\" stage.\n\nI reached out to Google's support today as I don't want to push this past my 15 day return window. \n\nThe response from Google?   \"The most effective way for you to handle this is to return to the store.\" This is AFTER I explain how far away it is.  I tell them that's not acceptable, and SORRY, CHARLIE!  That's all I'm getting. \n\nI can stomach (barely) paying $70 for $1.70 worth of Urethane because I know what design and tooling costs on plastics.  What I can't stomach is buying it from Google to then have Google tell me that they can't help me on a purchase from Google. \n\nThey sell the exact same case on the online store. My receipt from in-store appears on said website. What on EARTH are they thinking?  If this is a sign of the support I'll receive on the phone itself, I WILL drive back to the store and return the whole thing, Phone included!\n\nAnyone have ANY success stories on how to solve this?",

The shoe was \\~5 inches from the phone camera and her face(\\~5 feet away) was completely blurred out due to the bokeh. This was intentional and exactly the effect I wanted. I took the pic and it looked fine so I moved on. 2 days later I went back to look at it, and it has horrifyingly sharpened her face and her features look reminiscent of the old DALL-E mini ai generated images and the picture now has the \"Face Unblur\" tag in google photos. \n\nHow can I remove this or revert it back to what it was? It looks awful and is not at all what I wanted. Additionally, can I turn this feature off? If it's not going to work (I have 100s of blurry photos) then I don't think I want it on.\n\nThank you in advance!",

In any case, I presume the handset price wouldn't drop down beyond the RRP of the current free gift the Pixel Buds - ¬£219?\nIf it did drop down by around ¬£200 for Black Friday I would rather go for that than the current free Buds offer, if it was only like ¬£100 then I would rather just take the Buds now instead.\n\nI don't have anything to trade in, so enhanced trade in offers would make no difference to me, so if that's all they end up doing for Black Friday I would have been better off with the current deal. \n\nI guess what I need from you all is reassurance that Google/other reputable retailers have a consistent history of dropping the Pixel handset price by at least ¬£200 every Black Friday, is there a consistent track record of this? \n\nMany many thanks!",

I then turn off microphone access cause I was thinking maybe my audio book was triggering some weird \"turn off\" microphone command. Well then my phone acts even stranger. Reboots again and this time whenever I press the sleep button, it opens up the camera and then proceeds to prompt me to unblock the microphone, then it pulls up Gemini again. This literally repeats 4 or 5 times before I get freaked out and put it in airplane mode as a precaution. I get to work and turn off airplane mode and it hasn't occured since. \n\nI don't think it's hacking but it really felt like my phone was not listening to my commands and someone else was taking over the screen and trying to run Gemini. Anyone else see this behavior before? ",

    "selftext": "Before someone comes here to explain me about the miracles/horrors of Gemini Nano, please hear me out first.\n\nGoogle been talking a lot about AI when you look around Pixel Phones, if you read anything on internet about the Tensor G3, G4, G5... etc, AI is one of their main topics, including at Google Website.\n\nHowever, in the real world scenario, Google provides zero content to use this feature. If you want to use AI, it is Gemini or CPU rendering.\n\nQualcomm in other hand, does not advertise it much but you can take any high-end Qualcomm chipset and run local AI models in 1/100 the time due NPU acceleration (QNN)\n\nI have a 2022 old Sony phone, and I can produce AI images in 5 seconds while my Pixel 9 Pro takes almost almost 2 minutes due CPU processing.\n\n\\--\n\nBefore someone comes to talk to me about the miracles/horrors of Google AI Gallery or LiteRT, I think this is still bare-bones. You can see at their github page, they promote Google Tensor as \"Coming soon\".\n\nEdge Torch - The tool doing LLM model conversion - refers itself as \"broad CPU coverage, with **initial** GPU and NPU support\". This project started a year ago.\n\nThis to me is surprising, again, considering Google broadly talking about AI into Pixel phones but having nothing (except own made solutions), and Qualcomm talking very little about own phone chipsets but supporting most of their high-end devices for a while.",

I can't login to my google account on the new phone, it wants to use two-factor authentication. It tries to text a code, which obviously I don't have access to my texts. So I try to use an alternate method, which is a code via email. My laptop is logged into my account so I'm able to retrieve the code, but when I put it in I get a message that I'll get an email in 24 hours with a link to access my account.\n\nIn theory, that email will show up on my laptop, but how will that help me log in on the new phone? Any ideas here? My carrier is Google Fi. And if there's a better sub to post this on please let me know.",

It is specifically designed to connect to the Charging Speaker Dock and uses a unique pin configuration and internal circuitry known only to the tablet and the official dock.\nGeneric Specification: The cable you are considering is a generic 7.62mm 4-pin adapter designed for a wide range of small, low-power devices like smart watches, children's bracelets, and specific trackers (as mentioned in the reviews). The fact that the pins may look like they align does not mean the electrical connections (the pinout) will match the tablet's requirements.\nRisk of Damage: Attempting to charge a device with a non-compatible connector, even if it physically aligns, can potentially lead to no charge, slow charge, or in a worst-case scenario, damage to the device's internal charging circuitry.\nFor charging your Google Pixel Tablet, you should rely on the standard USB-C port or the official Google Charging Speaker Dock.\nthe end, your question was: Could this connector be used to charge my Google pixel 11-in tablet from the rear? The pins look like they will work and align",

That‚Äôs clearly wrong and against EU consumer law.\n\nSo I contacted Google support to get it corrected. That‚Äôs when the nightmare started.\n\nThey told me O2 isn‚Äôt an authorized reseller, even though it‚Äôs literally listed on Google‚Äôs official site.\n\nO2 confirmed they have no access or ability to change anything in Google‚Äôs warranty system.\n\nWhen I went back to Google with that, they just repeated the same false info and closed the case.\n\nAt one point, Google support even offered to remotely check the phone‚Äôs internal system logs to verify that it hadn‚Äôt been used before I purchased it. I agreed, and they confirmed exactly that ‚Äî the phone was first activated after my purchase date.\nAnd even after confirming it themselves, they still refused to fix the warranty.\n\nEvery agent I spoke to gave copy-pasted or contradictory replies. \nUnder both EU law and Google‚Äôs own warranty policy, Google is responsible for honoring the full 24-month warranty for products sold by authorized resellers. Passing the blame is not just lazy ‚Äî it‚Äôs unacceptable.\n\nThis whole experience has been absurd.\n\nTL;DR:\nBought a new Google phone from O2 (authorized reseller).\nGoogle‚Äôs system says it was bought 5 months earlier ‚Üí shortened warranty.\nGoogle checked the phone logs remotely and confirmed it hadn‚Äôt been used before purchase ‚Üí still refused to fix the warranty.\nSupport keeps giving false info and closing the case.\n\nHas anyone else in the EU had a wrong purchase date or shortened warranty on a new Google phone?

I used to have bedtime mode set up that it would then on when I plugged my phone in at night (which is when I was going to sleep) and then it would start in bedtime mode until a) my alarm went off or b) I unplugged my phone. This meant on weekends my phone would stay silent until I woke up and unplugged it myself.\nSince I updated my phone this week, bedtime mode will now turn itself off after the alarm time as that is when it says my \"night time\" ends, even if my phone is still plugged in and has not been touched. This means as soon as I get a notification on a weekend morning, I wake up and my precious lie in is ruined.\nAny one else having the same issue and any idea how to fix this? Thanks!",

This was the closest applicable sub I could find. \n\nThe nearest physical Google store is 6 hours away, and over 700 miles round trip.  I was in that town this weekend, bought a Fold 10 and a Zagg clear case. I wanted the Google branded case, but the in store rep sold me on the Zagg.   \nAfter a day of using it (we were home by then) It's clear that the Zagg case is so very thick that I can't reliably swipe up or \"in\" (back) on the front screen.   \nI started a return with Google, and it got \"hung up\" in the \"waiting for shipping information\" stage.\n\nI reached out to Google's support today as I don't want to push this past my 15 day return window. \n\nThe response from Google?   \"The most effective way for you to handle this is to return to the store.\" This is AFTER I explain how far away it is.  I tell them that's not acceptable, and SORRY, CHARLIE!  That's all I'm getting. \n\nI can stomach (barely) paying $70 for $1.70 worth of Urethane because I know what design and tooling costs on plastics.  What I can't stomach is buying it from Google to then have Google tell me that they can't help me on a purchase from Google. \n\nThey sell the exact same case on the online store. My receipt from in-store appears on said website. What on EARTH are they thinking?  If this is a sign of the support I'll receive on the phone itself, I WILL drive back to the store and return the whole thing, Phone included!\n\nAnyone have ANY success stories on how to solve this?",

The phone is detected via Bluetooth by the car, but the Android Auto interface doesn‚Äôt activate on the car‚Äôs display. Wired Android Auto works without any issues.\n* **Troubleshooting attempted**:\n   * Connected and disconnected the phone from the car‚Äôs Bluetooth.\n   * Removed the phone from the car‚Äôs device list and vice versa.\n   * Uninstalled and reinstalled the Android Auto app on my Pixel 9.\n   * Cleared the app‚Äôs cache and data.\n   * Updated my phone‚Äôs software and the Android Auto app to the latest versions.\n* I can provide screenshots or photos of the issue if needed.\n\nI‚Äôm completely out of ideas on how to resolve this. Has anyone encountered a similar problem or have any suggestions on what else I could try? Thanks in advance for your help!",

    "selftext": "I bought a brand new Google Pixel 9 Pro XL from O2 in Slovakia, which is officially listed on Google‚Äôs website as an authorized reseller since Google does not have any official physical store here in Europe. \nThe phone was sealed and never used, purchased in June 2025.\n\nWhen I checked the warranty on Google‚Äôs support page, it showed the phone as purchased in January ‚Äî five months before I actually bought it.\nThe warranty was already shortened to less than 24 months, even though EU law guarantees a full 24-month warranty for new products.\n\nAfter some digging, it seems Google started the warranty countdown from the day the phone arrived in O2‚Äôs stock, not from the day it was sold to me. That‚Äôs clearly wrong and against EU consumer law.\n\nSo I contacted Google support to get it corrected. That‚Äôs when the nightmare started.\n\nThey told me O2 isn‚Äôt an authorized reseller, even though it‚Äôs literally listed on Google‚Äôs official site.\n\nO2 confirmed they have no access or ability to change anything in Google‚Äôs warranty system.\n\nWhen I went back to Google with that, they just repeated the same false info and closed the case.\n\nAt one point, Google support even offered to remotely check the phone‚Äôs internal system logs to verify that it hadn‚Äôt been used before I purchased it. I agreed, and they confirmed exactly that ‚Äî the phone was first activated after my purchase date.\nAnd even after confirming it themselves, they still refused to fix the warranty.\n\nEvery agent I spoke to gave copy-pasted or contradictory replies. \nUnder both EU law and Google‚Äôs own warranty policy, Google is responsible for honoring the full 24-month warranty for products sold by authorized resellers. Passing the blame is not just lazy ‚Äî it‚Äôs unacceptable.\n\nThis whole experience has been absurd.\n\nTL;DR:\nBought a new Google phone from O2 (authorized reseller).\nGoogle‚Äôs system says it was bought 5 months earlier ‚Üí shortened warranty.\nGoogle checked the phone logs remotely and confirmed it hadn‚Äôt been used before purchase ‚Üí still refused to fix the warranty.\nSupport keeps giving false info and closing the case.\n\nHas anyone else in the EU had a wrong purchase date or shortened warranty on a new Google phone? Did you ever get Google to fix it?",

Either way, I noticed it wasn't due to a bad connection, the phone had rebooted? Weird, a couple minutes goes by and it happens again.\n\nThis time I keep my eyes on the phone to see what's going on, and it looked like Gemini was being pulled up. I then turn off microphone access cause I was thinking maybe my audio book was triggering some weird \"turn off\" microphone command. Well then my phone acts even stranger. Reboots again and this time whenever I press the sleep button, it opens up the camera and then proceeds to prompt me to unblock the microphone, then it pulls up Gemini again. This literally repeats 4 or 5 times before I get freaked out and put it in airplane mode as a precaution. I get to work and turn off airplane mode and it hasn't occured since. \n\nI don't think it's hacking but it really felt like my phone was not listening to my commands and someone else was taking over the screen and trying to run Gemini. Anyone else see this behavior before? ",

    "selftext": "There was a post on this topic from a year ago but it's locked and doesn't have any good responses.\n\nI was taking a photo of a shoe with my pixel 7 and one of my friends was in the background. The shoe was \\~5 inches from the phone camera and her face(\\~5 feet away) was completely blurred out due to the bokeh. This was intentional and exactly the effect I wanted. I took the pic and it looked fine so I moved on. 2 days later I went back to look at it, and it has horrifyingly sharpened her face and her features look reminiscent of the old DALL-E mini ai generated images and the picture now has the \"Face Unblur\" tag in google photos. \n\nHow can I remove this or revert it back to what it was? It looks awful and is not at all what I wanted. Additionally, can I turn this feature off? If it's not going to work (I have 100s of blurry photos) then I don't think I want it on.\n\nThank you in advance!",

This was the closest applicable sub I could find. \n\nThe nearest physical Google store is 6 hours away, and over 700 miles round trip.  I was in that town this weekend, bought a Fold 10 and a Zagg clear case. I wanted the Google branded case, but the in store rep sold me on the Zagg.   \nAfter a day of using it (we were home by then) It's clear that the Zagg case is so very thick that I can't reliably swipe up or \"in\" (back) on the front screen.   \nI started a return with Google, and it got \"hung up\" in the \"waiting for shipping information\" stage.\n\nI reached out to Google's support today as I don't want to push this past my 15 day return window. \n\nThe response from Google?   \"The most effective way for you to handle this is to return to the store.\" This is AFTER I explain how far away it is.  I tell them that's not acceptable, and SORRY, CHARLIE!  That's all I'm getting. \n\nI can stomach (barely) paying $70 for $1.70 worth of Urethane because I know what design and tooling costs on plastics.  What I can't stomach is buying it from Google to then have Google tell me that they can't help me on a purchase from Google. \n\nThey sell the exact same case on the online store. My receipt from in-store appears on said website. What on EARTH are they thinking?  If this is a sign of the support I'll receive on the phone itself, I WILL drive back to the store and return the whole thing, Phone included!\n\nAnyone have ANY success stories on how to solve this?",

I absolutely love it, i put it on the wall and its nicely up there.\n\nMy only concern is, the 2 top screws only screwed in a few turns before becoming tight. No cross thread as I pulled it out and did it again on both 2 or 3 times to be certain.\n\nHas anyone else found that the thread depth isn't very deep on the top 2 screws for mounting?\n\nConsidering taking it down and quadruple checking but wanting to leave it.\n\nIts been 24 hours now, no movement so want to leave it on the wall but the anxiety in the back of my mind tells me otherwise. I fear ill keep going in circles and eventually ruin it myself.\n\nMake me feel better please haha.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

My main complaints were the short battery life and longer time to charge, camera quality, and phone temperature during regular use/charging (it gets really warm on the outter screen). Maybe sometime in the future Samsung will bring the Z series closer to the ultra given their higher pricing. ",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I‚Äôve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

But that was my fault to not have backup.\n\n\n\nAnyway, i gotten a cheap Xiaomi phone to use until i was back to my country since i acquired Samsung care+.\n\nOnce returned and submitted it to the Samsung costumer center they mentioned few times, it will be a free repair unless water damage is detected.\n\nOf course, i kept the phone relatively well, but it received its shares of water splashes, and knowing very well what waterproof mean in the phone world i was ready to pay the 93\\~USD of screen change out of warranty. (The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra?

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion.

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally.

Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this sound bar isn‚Äôt quite on the same level as my old system was, but it‚Äôs probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Many nations throughout the world accept Samsung Pay, however consumers in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are still awaiting official acceptance. It's intriguing that Samsung Pay hasn't appeared yet given how technologically advanced these nations are.\n\nWhat do you believe is the reason for the hold up? Is it market size, regulations, or banking partnerships? What steps may Samsung take to expedite adoption in smaller European markets, in your opinion?",

They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "Hey y'all! I'm thinking of buying my first Galaxy Watch, and I need some help deciding. \n\nFor background: \n\n- I use a Galaxy S23 phone and Galaxy Buds 2. My current watch is a simple FitBit Versa 3 (so any Galaxy watch will be an upgrade lol).\n\n- I mainly wish to use the watch as an extension of my phone (texting, calling, music control, etc) with my phone nearby, so the LTE function won't be a necessity.\n\n- The main secondary purpose I need my watch for is fitness tracking: Tracking heart rate, steps, calories, distance, etc.\n\nI am on the fence right now. I have found a 47mm Galaxy 6 Classic for quite a good deal ($109 for the bluetooth OR LTE model), and that is the model I'm leaning towards. But before I buy, I want to know if paying an extra $100-$150 for the Galaxy 7 would be worth it for any newer specs or features that it has. \n\nI won't be using my watch as much for temperature tracking and GPS purposes (beyond tracking running/biking distance which I can also have my phone on me for). \n\nI also dont plan to download a ton of apps (mainly the defaults, a few interchangable watch faces, timer, calorie tracking, metronome, Spotify control, and possibly 1 or 2 games) so I'm unsure of how much of an impact the 16GB to 32GB difference would make on my satisfaction with either one. \n\nPlease, any insight, advice, and experience would be greatly appreciated!

    "selftext": "Hello all, im just wondering if anyone has had this experience since the OneUI 8 update. Now, i will clarify a few things:\n\n1. I use the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024)\n2. I've had the update for about 2-3 months\n\nI recently started running again, I started taking it seriously back in June (pre-update). When I was running then, I would do as I still do today; start the 'Running' exercise on Samsung Health (on the watch) and crack on. The activity face would report my live pace and report the split every km - if I ran at a  6:00/km then the split readout wouldn't report a 6:00/km pace.\n\nHowever, since the last major update (OneUI 8) on the watch, the live pace has been way off. This is my current experience: I start the 'Running' activity I crack on and check the live pace its reading 6:30. When I hit the first split and the readout occurs, its reading ~30s faster such as 'lap pace, 5:57/km' - and this is the split that is recorded after I finish the activity. So what has happened to the live readings? It's been like this for months, at this point, i am just used to it and just use the incorrect live pace, knowing what it is roughly and just read the split readout for the correct information. Has anyone else experienced this, from OneUI 7 > OneUI 8? I don't know if this is Watch Ultra specific issue or across the product range.\n\nTLDR: Live running pace used to be relatively accurate, since One UI 8 update, the live pace is reported as a much slower pace than what the actual pace is.",

    "selftext": "I have been a long time smartwatch user and have tried a lot of brands. I have mostly settled on Samsung and Amazfit but each is missing something. This is short wish list of changes for Galaxy watches:\n\n  \n1) **let me swipe away individual notifications**. Right now, I have to clear all of them at once, or tap on each one and clear it. I would rather just swipe from the list to do some quick triaging;\n\n2) **improve the step count deduping** between watch and phone. Right now it really seems to overcount, so I just turn off step counting on my phone, which is a shame because it would be nice to track some steps while my watch is charging\n\n3) **add Energy Score to the Galaxy Fit 3.** that would make it a great companion to the Galaxy watch. I could wear it at night for seemless tracking. I also prefer it for some sports where I want a smaller, lighter device and I dont need GPS\n\n  \n4) **Make message replies via voice faster**. On Amazfit, I can tap the notification, then hold down a button to active the voice assistant and can directly dictate. On WearOS, it takes a lot of taps to do that (tap the notification, open on watch, reply, keyboard, swipe up to select different keyboards, tap the microphone icon)\n\n  \n5) **consider swiping up for notifications and using both left and right swipes to access tiles**. That lets me get at my 2 most important tiles with a single swipe.\n\n  \n5a) *bonus* \\- **consider a shortcut tile**. Amazfit does this well and has it as a list you can scroll through. Galaxy watches have this a bit with the new tile designs but it still caps at 4.\n\n\n\nThese are just my thoughts. Maybe it's just me :)",

If not, can you use it alone? If so, should I use it already or should I wait over a month and use it when I get the phone? \n\nThanks a lot, really??",

    "selftext": "Ever since I updated my Watch7 to One UI 8, I‚Äôve had issues twice with the auto-pause feature during workouts (something that never happened before on the previous version).\n\nYesterday I went for a bike ride and stopped midway to chat with a friend. The watch correctly paused the workout, but when we started moving again, I noticed later that it never resumed tracking. Result: I lost a big chunk of my ride data.\n\nToday, I went cycling again and took a short break. The watch paused as expected. When I started riding back home, I remembered the issue from yesterday and checked: it was still paused, even though I was already moving. I manually resumed it and finished the ride, but when I got home, I saw that it tracked the time of my return but didn‚Äôt record the route on the map. So the saved activity shows double the duration and only half the distance, ending exactly where it paused during my break.\n\nNot sure if a factory reset would fix this. For now, I‚Äôll try disabling auto-pause and rely on manual pausing/unpausing, hoping it doesn‚Äôt bug out again. Otherwise, I might have to ditch Samsung Health and just record directly on Strava.\n\nAnyone else running into this issue?",

The official samsung support is currently unavailable since it's Sunday, but judging by how hard it was to find the phone number or live chat link and fight with AI assistant to conn3ect me with human I can only hope they will help. \n\nI can post the full video of the steps I take if my internet-taught english isn't that good. \n\nAlso if my post dosen't fit the subreddit, I would really appreciate if you could point me to a right page, and I will immidietly delete this post.

It's not like the watch is hung, but on the activity screen it will keep showing only which HR Zones you are on right now. Pressing the button would let you pause or resume activity but the HR screen just remains and won't let you see the other vital information. The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time. Later I found a work around, you need to open Samsung Health app on your phone then select the activity again which kinda resets the screen, but this is such a hassle to do mid ride when you can't even see the time. I used a Galaxy Watch 4 for a short time and it never had this problem, only on my new watch I'm experiencing this bug. \n\nAnyone else experienceing this issue?",

And are there any other disadvantages compared to the 7?\n\nWhat Ill use the watch for:\n- Running\n- Sleep\n- Notifications\n- Heart rate \n- ECG\n- Track tasks\n- Alarms\n- ....\n\n\nThe price is similar if it matters.\n\nThe 8 classic is nearly 3X as expensive, so it is not an option.",

So I turned of Bluetooth, then put airplane mode so lte dosent turn on nd then tucked in for the night.\n\nThis morning I wake up, lo nd behold the battery has gone down just 3%! Usually it consumes almost 12 to 15% everynight. Not just that, I reconnected it to my phone and it had tracked my sleep(along with hr and breathing) properly like it does everyday.\n\nThe thing is, in the battery section of settings it just shows what apps are using the battery which all combined isn't even 20%. \n\nSo, while being connected to the phone while your awake is non negotiable, ig it works if u want to just make it last a little longer in case u don't want to turn health features off \n\nEdit: what a weird coincidence, that someone asked a question on batter drain during night as I was writing this post, lol\n\nEdit2: corrected first line from hrs to days, sry",

    "selftext": "Hey y'all! I'm thinking of buying my first Galaxy Watch, and I need some help deciding. \n\nFor background: \n\n- I use a Galaxy S23 phone and Galaxy Buds 2. My current watch is a simple FitBit Versa 3 (so any Galaxy watch will be an upgrade lol).\n\n- I mainly wish to use the watch as an extension of my phone (texting, calling, music control, etc) with my phone nearby, so the LTE function won't be a necessity.\n\n- The main secondary purpose I need my watch for is fitness tracking: Tracking heart rate, steps, calories, distance, etc.\n\nI am on the fence right now. I have found a 47mm Galaxy 6 Classic for quite a good deal ($109 for the bluetooth OR LTE model), and that is the model I'm leaning towards. But before I buy, I want to know if paying an extra $100-$150 for the Galaxy 7 would be worth it for any newer specs or features that it has. \n\nI won't be using my watch as much for temperature tracking and GPS purposes (beyond tracking running/biking distance which I can also have my phone on me for). \n\nI also dont plan to download a ton of apps (mainly the defaults, a few interchangable watch faces, timer, calorie tracking, metronome, Spotify control, and possibly 1 or 2 games) so I'm unsure of how much of an impact the 16GB to 32GB difference would make on my satisfaction with either one. \n\nPlease, any insight, advice, and experience would be greatly appreciated!

    "title": "Live running split times incorrect since OneUI 8 update",
    "selftext": "Hello all, im just wondering if anyone has had this experience since the OneUI 8 update. Now, i will clarify a few things:\n\n1. I use the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024)\n2. I've had the update for about 2-3 months\n\nI recently started running again, I started taking it seriously back in June (pre-update). When I was running then, I would do as I still do today; start the 'Running' exercise on Samsung Health (on the watch) and crack on. The activity face would report my live pace and report the split every km - if I ran at a  6:00/km then the split readout wouldn't report a 6:00/km pace.\n\nHowever, since the last major update (OneUI 8) on the watch, the live pace has been way off. This is my current experience: I start the 'Running' activity I crack on and check the live pace its reading 6:30. When I hit the first split and the readout occurs, its reading ~30s faster such as 'lap pace, 5:57/km' - and this is the split that is recorded after I finish the activity. So what has happened to the live readings? It's been like this for months, at this point, i am just used to it and just use the incorrect live pace, knowing what it is roughly and just read the split readout for the correct information. Has anyone else experienced this, from OneUI 7 > OneUI 8? I don't know if this is Watch Ultra specific issue or across the product range.\n\nTLDR: Live running pace used to be relatively accurate, since One UI 8 update, the live pace is reported as a much slower pace than what the actual pace is.",

    "selftext": "I have been a long time smartwatch user and have tried a lot of brands. I have mostly settled on Samsung and Amazfit but each is missing something. This is short wish list of changes for Galaxy watches:\n\n  \n1) **let me swipe away individual notifications**. Right now, I have to clear all of them at once, or tap on each one and clear it. I would rather just swipe from the list to do some quick triaging;\n\n2) **improve the step count deduping** between watch and phone. Right now it really seems to overcount, so I just turn off step counting on my phone, which is a shame because it would be nice to track some steps while my watch is charging\n\n3) **add Energy Score to the Galaxy Fit 3.** that would make it a great companion to the Galaxy watch. I could wear it at night for seemless tracking. I also prefer it for some sports where I want a smaller, lighter device and I dont need GPS\n\n  \n4) **Make message replies via voice faster**. On Amazfit, I can tap the notification, then hold down a button to active the voice assistant and can directly dictate. On WearOS, it takes a lot of taps to do that (tap the notification, open on watch, reply, keyboard, swipe up to select different keyboards, tap the microphone icon)\n\n  \n5) **consider swiping up for notifications and using both left and right swipes to access tiles**. That lets me get at my 2 most important tiles with a single swipe.\n\n  \n5a) *bonus* \\- **consider a shortcut tile**. Amazfit does this well and has it as a list you can scroll through. Galaxy watches have this a bit with the new tile designs but it still caps at 4.\n\n\n\nThese are just my thoughts. Maybe it's just me :)",

I also noticed that activity screen shows 0 calories throughout the exercise, and these 50-60 kcal only get added after I finish exercise. \n\nJust to add that walking activity seems to be unaffected by the update and counts calories the same as before the update.\n\nAnyone else dealing with the same issue or has any idea what to do?

My current watch is a simple FitBit Versa 3 (so any Galaxy watch will be an upgrade lol).\n\n- I mainly wish to use the watch as an extension of my phone (texting, calling, music control, etc) with my phone nearby, so the LTE function won't be a necessity.\n\n- The main secondary purpose I need my watch for is fitness tracking: Tracking heart rate, steps, calories, distance, etc.\n\nI am on the fence right now. I have found a 47mm Galaxy 6 Classic for quite a good deal ($109 for the bluetooth OR LTE model), and that is the model I'm leaning towards. But before I buy, I want to know if paying an extra $100-$150 for the Galaxy 7 would be worth it for any newer specs or features that it has. \n\nI won't be using my watch as much for temperature tracking and GPS purposes (beyond tracking running/biking distance which I can also have my phone on me for). \n\nI also dont plan to download a ton of apps (mainly the defaults, a few interchangable watch faces, timer, calorie tracking, metronome, Spotify control, and possibly 1 or 2 games) so I'm unsure of how much of an impact the 16GB to 32GB difference would make on my satisfaction with either one. \n\nPlease, any insight, advice, and experience would be greatly appreciated!

    "selftext": "Hello all, im just wondering if anyone has had this experience since the OneUI 8 update. Now, i will clarify a few things:\n\n1. I use the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024)\n2. I've had the update for about 2-3 months\n\nI recently started running again, I started taking it seriously back in June (pre-update). When I was running then, I would do as I still do today; start the 'Running' exercise on Samsung Health (on the watch) and crack on. The activity face would report my live pace and report the split every km - if I ran at a  6:00/km then the split readout wouldn't report a 6:00/km pace.\n\nHowever, since the last major update (OneUI 8) on the watch, the live pace has been way off. This is my current experience: I start the 'Running' activity I crack on and check the live pace its reading 6:30. When I hit the first split and the readout occurs, its reading ~30s faster such as 'lap pace, 5:57/km' - and this is the split that is recorded after I finish the activity. So what has happened to the live readings? It's been like this for months, at this point, i am just used to it and just use the incorrect live pace, knowing what it is roughly and just read the split readout for the correct information. Has anyone else experienced this, from OneUI 7 > OneUI 8? I don't know if this is Watch Ultra specific issue or across the product range.\n\nTLDR: Live running pace used to be relatively accurate, since One UI 8 update, the live pace is reported as a much slower pace than what the actual pace is.",

    "selftext": "I have been a long time smartwatch user and have tried a lot of brands. I have mostly settled on Samsung and Amazfit but each is missing something. This is short wish list of changes for Galaxy watches:\n\n  \n1) **let me swipe away individual notifications**. Right now, I have to clear all of them at once, or tap on each one and clear it. I would rather just swipe from the list to do some quick triaging;\n\n2) **improve the step count deduping** between watch and phone. Right now it really seems to overcount, so I just turn off step counting on my phone, which is a shame because it would be nice to track some steps while my watch is charging\n\n3) **add Energy Score to the Galaxy Fit 3.** that would make it a great companion to the Galaxy watch. I could wear it at night for seemless tracking. I also prefer it for some sports where I want a smaller, lighter device and I dont need GPS\n\n  \n4) **Make message replies via voice faster**. On Amazfit, I can tap the notification, then hold down a button to active the voice assistant and can directly dictate. On WearOS, it takes a lot of taps to do that (tap the notification, open on watch, reply, keyboard, swipe up to select different keyboards, tap the microphone icon)\n\n  \n5) **consider swiping up for notifications and using both left and right swipes to access tiles**. That lets me get at my 2 most important tiles with a single swipe.\n\n  \n5a) *bonus* \\- **consider a shortcut tile**. Amazfit does this well and has it as a list you can scroll through. Galaxy watches have this a bit with the new tile designs but it still caps at 4.\n\n\n\nThese are just my thoughts. Maybe it's just me :)",

It worked great, but it‚Äôs kind of giving up, the trackpad and some keys have stopped working, so I figured it‚Äôs time to start looking for a replacement.\n\nThe problem is, I have no idea where to start, last time I just got the first one I found I could open word and netflix on, now I have a degree and actually need to work with my laptop. Here‚Äôs what I know so far:\n\n* I want something smaller than 15\", I‚Äôm studying and working, and I carry it around a lot,  my current one is way too heavy.\n* I‚Äôll probably buy refurbished, since it‚Äôs much cheaper and I don‚Äôt really see a downside.\n* I‚Äôve started doing more programming (and I recently got a job in bioinformatics), so I‚Äôll be dealing with large datasets and the current one takes hours for each command. Not sure how much that should affect my choice.\n* I usually have a lot of programs and windows open at the same time.\n* I don‚Äôt really care about graphics (no gaming or design work).\n* I really like ThinkPads but mostly because they look sturdy and reliable, and I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt risk breaking it every time I move it.\n* Also, I would like to have usb ports and possibly hdmi but that is not essential.\n* And no Macs.\n\nSo yeah, I‚Äôm just looking for advice on what to go for models, characteristics, or anything I should keep in mind.

    "selftext": "I have a ASUS - TUF 15.6\" Gaming Laptop, and I have been having some issues and wanted some advice/help on what to do. I'm not good with computers at all, so please bear with me. I got my laptop last year, around February. Had no issues for a long time and then issues slowly started ariving. \n\nI accidentally spilled some water on the keyboard at some point. I instantly cleaned it up and seemed fine after, but I think it is important to note. I also have it plugged in longer than I should due to playing games on it. In my current situation, I cannot have a computer setup, so I have to have a laptop. \n\nMore frequently than not, when I press the power button, it does not turn on. When plugging it in, it shows that it is charging, but there is no life outside of that. There are also some weeks where, for about a week, it turns on instantly, and then it goes back to doing this. If I spend long enough time pressing the power button when it doesn't want to turn on, at some point it will power on and then work fine until I turn it off, and I'm back in the same situation the next day. \n\nI'm just kind of confused about what could be going wrong. I'm not against taking it somewhere to get it fixed, but if it is just simply a new battery needed, I think I could do it if I followed a video.  If it is believed to be a bigger issue, what would it even be/how much money would it be to get fixed. Any help or advice would be appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Hello, just looking for some advice on what to do in my situation.\n\nEarlier this year, my 2020 MacBook Air just randomly stopped working overnight, I took it to the Apple Store and they quoted roughly ¬£400 to fix it (I believe it‚Äôs to replace the logic board, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure). I didn‚Äôt get Apple Care which I feel very stupid for now!\n\nAs a replacement, I bought a 15‚Äù iPad Air (the newest one). I had finished university at that point and so didn‚Äôt see the need for a laptop really as all I was using it for was watching YouTube and playing the Sims 4.\n\nNow I‚Äôve had the iPad for around 6 months, as much as I do like it and do use it a fair bit, it is absolutely not a replacement for a laptop and I feel like I‚Äôm missing having a laptop for things, e.g. I do volunteering which requires a lot of typing and quick research, as well as doing things like online courses or job searching, which are all more difficult on an iPad, and also playing the Sims which of course the iPad can‚Äôt do.\n\nBudget wise, I can afford to buy a new MacBook Air, I‚Äôm just not sure the price is worth how much I would use it, but having used a MacBook I don‚Äôt know if I would really like using any other operating system now because of how good Apple is/how much I like it personally.\n\nThe way I see it, I have a couple of options:\n- Buy a new laptop that isn‚Äôt a MacBook but is still good quality (e.g. Windows laptop with i5 for ¬£500 or less)\n- Buy a new MacBook Air (which is around ¬£1k)\n- Get my current MacBook repaired\n- Buy the Magic Keyboard for my iPad. That still doesn‚Äôt fix the Sims issue but is the cheapest option to make my iPad as laptop-like as possible.\n\nI would love to hear other people‚Äôs thoughts on this or if there are other options that I haven‚Äôt thought of!",

I have a great pc at home that I built myself so I will probably only need the laptop for that semester so I don't want to spend too much money on it unnecessarily but I do need to be able to run some stuff cause I'm an enginneering student. I don't necessarily need specific reccomendations, helping me figure out what i need to look for would also be helpful.\n\n**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** Not sure.\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes but new seems easier/safer\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Not sure. Performance is obviously important, I need to be able to run everything i need, but other than that idk. 2 in 1 sounds great because I also draw digitally but it might be too expensive and not worth it so idk\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** I need to be able to carry it around so nothing too heavy but it doesn't need to be the lightest thinnest one possible either.\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** N/A\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** I need to be able to do some CAD stuff for uni but I'm not entirely sure what programs we'll use since it is a new uni. But definitely some kind of 3d CAD. I do game sometimes but usually nothing too heavy and tbh this is not that big of a priority rn. I do also draw, rn I use Clip Studio Paint.\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** \\-\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Not sure. I assume I probably need a dedicated gpu but idk. \n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** As a general thing, I do really like the idea of something thats more easily repearable and upgradeable (that was the whole reason I built my own pc, lol) so I did look a little into framework laptops but idk if they would be worth it in this case so idk",

Dell has been otherwise solid but after googling i found out that hinges are a big problem so maube not dell anymore. Im not touching hp or apple. From what i know asus has a lot of bloatware but are there any other issues? Samsung is also a no go as there has been cracked screens. So my options right now are lenovo, asus and something like acer. Do any of them have some major flaws?",

I'll also be using it for online teaching. \n\nDoes anyone know of a laptop with good stylus support if yes, i can definitely just buy that. \nAny recommendations or advice and no gos will ne helpful\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Hello guys.   \nI have a big problem with my HP laptop (17-cp2451ng on Win 11)  \nEverything was working fine, yesterday I finished working on it and I set it to shut down and closed the laptop, perhaps a little before it had time to shut down completely.   \n  \nThen, a few hours later, I turned it back on and the screen backlight is not terning on, it felt like the brightness had dropped to 1% and couldn't be adjusted. If you shine a flashlight on the screen, you can see that the matrix is working, but there is no brightness at all.   \n  \nI tried restarting, including hard reset, went into the BIOS - reset to defaults ‚Äîthere, too, backlight is not working, 1% brightness.   \nThen I tried uninstalling the monitor and video adapter drivers and restarting, but that didn't help.   \nI tried pressing Win + Ctrl + Shift + B - the screen flashes for a second, but the brightness/backlight does not return.   \nIn the settings, the brightness is set to 100%.   \nFN+f3 (F with the sun on it) also does not change anything.   \nIn general, I have tried most of the advices from the ai. No help so far.  \n  \nLet's try the humans, maybe some of you knows how to fix it?  \nHow can I get the backlight working again?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "ive had this asus vivobook touchscreen for about a year now, and it has never been cooperative when it comes to gaming. generally speaking, when i try to play any games such as the games on roblox, the game is just overall laggy and almost impossible to play. it'll freeze, take ages to load, have my roblox timeout (happens like 90% of the time), and is just super super duper annoying. \n\neven when i try to do literally anything else such as classwork on it, it just takes a lot of time to load up the material and sometimes just straight up freezes for around 5 minutes. ive been wanting to install games such as cs2 and valorant so i can play, but with my laptops performance, i just don't think it can work out. \n\ndoes anyone have any tips on how to improve the quality of my laptop so it isn't laggy? i would like it to be usable and not whatever condition it's in right now.",

I didn‚Äôt get Apple Care which I feel very stupid for now!\n\nAs a replacement, I bought a 15‚Äù iPad Air (the newest one). I had finished university at that point and so didn‚Äôt see the need for a laptop really as all I was using it for was watching YouTube and playing the Sims 4.\n\nNow I‚Äôve had the iPad for around 6 months, as much as I do like it and do use it a fair bit, it is absolutely not a replacement for a laptop and I feel like I‚Äôm missing having a laptop for things, e.g. I do volunteering which requires a lot of typing and quick research, as well as doing things like online courses or job searching, which are all more difficult on an iPad, and also playing the Sims which of course the iPad can‚Äôt do.\n\nBudget wise, I can afford to buy a new MacBook Air, I‚Äôm just not sure the price is worth how much I would use it, but having used a MacBook I don‚Äôt know if I would really like using any other operating system now because of how good Apple is/how much I like it personally.\n\nThe way I see it, I have a couple of options:\n- Buy a new laptop that isn‚Äôt a MacBook but is still good quality (e.g. Windows laptop with i5 for ¬£500 or less)\n- Buy a new MacBook Air (which is around ¬£1k)\n- Get my current MacBook repaired\n- Buy the Magic Keyboard for my iPad.

The issue is that when re-opening the laptop, the screen does not turn on.

I currently have to restart the whole computer to fix the dimness.\n\nAs far as I know, nothing should have happened to the computer since this started happening. It sits on a computer mat plugged in in my room 24/7. No pets. Everything looks clean on the inside. I dont see or believe any damage has been done to it anytime recently. Computer is only a few years old.\n\nLooking for a fix! any help is appreciated since its a huge pain having to restart every time I want to use the computer.",

I mainly play shooters like Warzone or Valorant, but I also would like to be able to play GTA VI when it releases, so I'm thinking about upgrading. The problem I have is deciding between a full-on upgrade, basically a new PC (AM4 -> AM5), or just getting a new GPU (and maybe more RAM) for now and upgrading the rest later. What would be the most cost-efficient way? Is AM5 such a big improvement that it makes sense to switch now? I would really like to upgrade over time, but idk if that's smart in my case. I would appreciate it to hear some opinions on what's best. Thank you in advance.\n\nSpecs:  \nCPU - Ryzen 5 5500  \nGPU - MSI Radeon RX 5500 XT Gaming x 8GB  \nRAM - G.Skill TridentZ RGB 2x 8GB DDR4-3000 CL16-18-18-38  \nMB - Asus Prime x470 pro  \nPSU - Seasonic Focus Plus Platinum 550W 80+\n\nEverything is about 5-6 years old, except the CPU (\\~3 years).",

    "selftext": "So honestly, it seems no matter how much research I'm doing, I can't seem to figure out what ram actually works with my pc. When I got this pc a few years back, it was when DDR5 was still new so I thought that 16gb DDR5 = 32gb DDR4 so I would be fine with 16. It seems I was very wrong and as more games need more ram my pc is struggling. It has gotten to the point where playing a few games my entire pc freezes. My only guess is that it is a ram overload issue. I am looking to upgrade with the coming up Black Friday sales, but I can't tell what works with my pc. I looked at my motherboard and the speeds it can go up to, and which ones are supported. However, I've also learned that CPU also matters in terms of speed and the ram being compatible? Can anyone possibly help, I don't want to spend on something that won't actually work. My goal is 32gb by 2 16gb sticks. I'm assuming more speed is better so whatever ram is close to the max my CPU/motherboard can do is probably what I want (unless advised against). Any help is very much appreciated.\n\n[https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/PRO-Z690-A-WIFI/support#mem](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/PRO-Z690-A-WIFI/support#mem)  \n  \nMy build:  \n\n* Motherboard - PRO Z690-A WIFI (DDR5 version) \n* CPU - Intel i7-12700K \n* GPU - Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti \n* Power - 750W (don't know if this matters but ill list it anyway)",

After noticing that the case came with 3 x 120 mm fans pre-installed in the front of the case for intake, my initial thought was to just return the 3-pack of fans I bought. However, I did some research and found out that the fans that come pre-installed in the case are not iCUE compatible. In my scenario, should I replace the pre-installed fans with the 3-pack of fans I bought? The reason why I ask is because my AIO is the Corsair Titan 360 RX, my two intake fans at the bottom are LX120-R, and the single exhaust fans in the back of my case is a RX120, so I thought it would be nice to have everything iCUE compatible. What would you do in my scenario? I would save about 80 bucks by returning the 3-pack of Corsair RX 120 mm fans and using the pre-installed fans. This is my first pc build so I'm unsure how bad it is to have different fans in the same build.",

For this, is 8Gb enough? My current GPU has 6Gb, it's a 2060 Super, and from what I listed I can play every game I want some compromises (again, AAA stays on the console). I'm aware of the dogma that's been getting repeated over and over again for the past like 2-3 years, \"8Gb cards should go straight to the bin\" with examples of Stalker not even starting at 4k and such, so I want realistic answers, I already watched every big tech youtuber's video, and it almost seems like they're just parroting each other. \n\n\n\nThanks!

    "selftext": "Hi Everyone, \n\nIt has been about 5 years since I last upgraded my machine and instead of using the same case I had previously for 12 years (fractal define R4). I decided it's time for a ground up build. \n\nI like Racing and FPS and hope to have some racing simulator parts next year after bonus time. I did a lot of research on the parts of this build determining where the best price for performance was while still striving for the best. Say what you will about Nvidia the 5090 is the best card right now and I wanted 4K gaming for the next several years. I also work with LLMs and run things locally although my old PC will likely become the server where I run those workloads. Researching the AMD processors there were some really good youtube videos outlining the performance difference for 9950x3d vs. 9800 x3d and because they were within a few frames of each other I deciding to go with the 9800X3D. I don't do a ton of multithreaded work like content or code compilation. The rest of my choices stem from the fact the I love ASUS motherboards and the TUF style hardware and design. Obviously I am a big Noctua fan (haha) as well s the black and brown theme of the build was good to embrace their colors. \n\nI had seen the Fractal North years ago before it was available in the US and loved it bt I was actually going to get the Antec Flux mid tower case before it went out of stock. I picked up all these parts in person at microcenter an hour away from me (except the Noctua fans, they didn't have the G2 LS models). So I defaulted back to the North case and couldn't be happier, although I have to return some of the extra fans. \n\nThis build is absolutely silent and the temps are 45 C for the CPU and 49 C for the GPU at idle. Build Pics and parts list are below. I gave you a gander at my full desk where I have my work standing desk. Still a lot of cable cleanup to do here but it is functional and I like that. I have been in this place for less than a year so still need to paint and add some art. Cheers to you and your builds. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/9g4md31](https://imgur.com/a/9g4md31)\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/b/q4gbt6](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/q4gbt6)",

    "title": "Looking to build an editing/design PC",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone! So I'm looking to build a PC specifically dedicated for designing in programs like Photoshop and Blender, and I'm also learning how to edit in Davinci Resolve (I'm totally new to it) and desperately need a new PC as my current one can barely stay afloat anymore while even doing simple tasks in Photoshop. No RGB will be needed on this build as it'll be under my desk. \n\nMy budget is roughly around $3300 CAD ($2350 USD) but I'm willing to go over a bit by maybe $200-400 if it's really worth it. I've done some research via YouTube, here on Reddit, etc. and it seems like a CPU like the Ryzen 9 7950X is a very solid choice for all of the multitasking I'll be doing, but on the other hand I've heard great things about the Intel Core Ultra series and how favorable those CPUs are for video editing. I think I'll mostly be doing a lot of work designing (so a lot of Photoshop/Blender) but I'll be dabbling into editing here and there too, so I definitely need help with my CPU selection on this build. \n\nMy other concern is the GPU. I've chosen a 5070 Ti for this build as it seems like it's the best price/performance, but I could be wrong there. Would upgrading to a 5080 really be worth the extra money? I likely won't be video editing in anything higher than 4k (at least for now) but maybe future proofing to a 5080 could be worth it. Any other options would be great too.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to mention here is that I'd really love a case with good airflow. My current build has very poor airflow and gets hot very often, mostly because I chose a pretty mid-tier case as I built it 5 years ago and had a much lower budget back then. So if you know of any good cases with solid airflow, feel free to mention them/add them to the parts list. It doesn't need to be a huge case either. 50-55ish L is about perfect in terms of volume.\n\nMy last question here is that I'm thinking I should just wait for black Friday since I'm sure there will be tons of deals on these parts, but I'd honestly rather not wait that long, but if it's worth the wait for another month, let me know what you guys think.  \n  \nI'm going to link a few builds I've put together. Feel free to mess around with them as nothing is final, they're just ideas. Overall I think I have some solid choices, especially considering the budget. \n\nBuild 1 - [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/frwvJn](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/frwvJn)\n\nBuild 2 - [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/BkR7Lc](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/BkR7Lc) (Very similar to build 1, just not sure if PCIe 5.0 is better for what I'll be doing)  \n  \nBuild 3 - [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/HDwqFZ](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/HDwqFZ)  \n\n",

    "selftext": "I'm planning a major upgrade for my 6-year-old PC. My goal is to get a significant CPU performance boost for gaming and to set up a clean dual-boot system, all while moving to the modern AM5 platform.\n\n---\n\n**My Current Specs:**\n\n**CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 3600\n\n**GPU:** ASUS GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER DUAL EVO OC\n\n**Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Strix B450-F GAMING\n\n**RAM:** Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3600MHz CL18\n\n**SSD:** Kingston A2000 500GB NVMe M.2 (Gen 3)\n\n**PSU:** Corsair Vengeance 650M 650W 80+ Silver\n\n---\n\n**Why I'm Upgrading:**\n\n**CPU power:** The **Ryzen 5 3600** has been a champ, but I'm starting to feel its age in newer, more CPU-demanding games.\n\n**Dual-boot setup:** I want to run two separate M.2 NVMe SSDs, one for Windows, one for Linux. I could simply buy a bigger Gen 4 SSD, plop it in and partition it and go on with my life, but I wouldn't mind an upgrade. So, here we are with a bad excuse to upgrade.\n\n---\n\n**What I Think I Need:**\nI believe I need a new CPU, Motherboard, RAM, and two new SSDs. I'm planning to keep my RTX 2080 Super for now, as my monitor is 1080p/144Hz and it still holds up okay.\n\n---\n\n**My Planned Upgrade & Questions:**\n\n**CPU:** Leaning towards an **AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D** for its gaming performance, or possibly a **Ryzen 5 7600/X** to save some budget. I'm open to suggestions here.\n\n**Motherboard:** This is a key point. I need a board that allows me to use two M.2 NVMe SSDs without forcing the main PCIe x16 slot (for my GPU) to run at x8 mode. I've read that some boards share lanes and can cause this, and I want to avoid that performance hit. I do not know much about this stuff and I find reading manuals to be a difficult thing.\n\n**RAM:** 32GB (2x16GB) of DDR5. I do not really know what speeds and CL I should be going for, or if they even matter much for mostly casual gaming, and some game development/computer graphics projects. The GPU will predominantly carry the latter.\n\n**Storage:** Two 1TB M.2 NVMe SSDs. I don't know if Gen 5 is overkill and or worth the extra cost compared to gen 4?\n\n**Cooler:** I will need a new cooler as these CPUs don't come with one, I think. Again, I have no clue what good coolers are.\n\n---\n\n**My Main Questions for You:**\n\n**PSU Sufficiency:** Is my 6-year-old 650W Silver PSU enough for a new AM5 build (e.g., with a 7800X3D and my 2080 Super), or is this the time to upgrade that as well for safety and headroom?\n\n**Motherboard Confirmation:** Can you recommend specific motherboard models that definitively keep the main PCIe slot at x16 when two M.2 slots are populated?\n\n**CPU Choice:** For a primarily gaming-focused build at 1080p, with potentially going for 1440p in the future, is the 7800X3D the clear winner, or would the value of a 7600/X make more sense since I'm not upgrading my GPU yet?\n\n---\n\n**Budget & Location:**\n\n**Budget:** ~1000 EURO (somewhat flexible +- 200 EURO depending on the potential gains)\n\n**Country:** Sweden",

About the past month or so my usual gaming setup started giving me troubles, I couldn't play Dota 2 anymore with youtube in the background without my game crashing. Then 2 weeks ago my computer started giving me blue screens, increasingly frequent until it started crashing on startup, wouldn't make it to windows. \n\n  \nApparently thats a memory problem, so I tried taking out one of the RAM modules, then the other, and it would still crash. I bought a new pair (because it costs 40 dollars to send RMA to the US anyway) and it still gave me issues. So I tried going back to my 3600 and putting the new ram modules on a different DIMM slot. That worked perfectly; OCCT didn't give me any errors. I tried slotting the 5700x3d in again hoping it was the DIMM slot; I could boot to windows this time but it would still give blue screens after a few seconds.\n\n  \nI'm not sure if it was the DIMM slot on my mobo or the old RAM was faulty, but I think one of them damaged my 5700x3d. Anyone have any ideas if I can still salvage this thing? No RMA for it since it's from AE.\n\n\n\nSpec:\n\nASUS ROG STRIX B550-A GAMING\n\nCrucial 3200mhz 2x8gb -> Gigastone 3200mhz 2x8gb",

    "title": "Replacing My CPU So I Need A New Motherboard",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I've built 5 different PCs in my day but it's been over 4 years since I last built one. I am looking to upgrade my CPU to a [AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 4.3 GHz 16-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Pk62FT/amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d-43-ghz-16-core-processor-100-100000719wof) from a Intel i7-4790 3.6 GHz 4-Core Processor. I will also upgrade my Graphics Card later but want to do the two things separately. However, my motherboard can't take a more powerful CPU. And I have never replaced a Motherboard, and to be honest I usually just wing the Motherboard. It's the aspect of PC building that I know the least about. So I am planning on switching to an ASRock B650 PG LIGHTNING ATX AM5 Motherboard. And I want to hear your thoughts on this. Is that good? Is it overkill? Underkill? Just Right? Does it matter? What are your thoughts.  \nJust for information's sake my current GPU is a GTX 2070 Super. And I'll probably switch to a 5070 Ti but that's about $750 I don't want to spend right now. If anyone has advice on that transfer I'd also be interested in that.  \nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hi Everyone, \n\nIt has been about 5 years since I last upgraded my machine and instead of using the same case I had previously for 12 years (fractal define R4). I decided it's time for a ground up build. \n\nI like Racing and FPS and hope to have some racing simulator parts next year after bonus time. I did a lot of research on the parts of this build determining where the best price for performance was while still striving for the best. Say what you will about Nvidia the 5090 is the best card right now and I wanted 4K gaming for the next several years. I also work with LLMs and run things locally although my old PC will likely become the server where I run those workloads. Researching the AMD processors there were some really good youtube videos outlining the performance difference for 9950x3d vs. 9800 x3d and because they were within a few frames of each other I deciding to go with the 9800X3D. I don't do a ton of multithreaded work like content or code compilation. The rest of my choices stem from the fact the I love ASUS motherboards and the TUF style hardware and design. Obviously I am a big Noctua fan (haha) as well s the black and brown theme of the build was good to embrace their colors. \n\nI had seen the Fractal North years ago before it was available in the US and loved it bt I was actually going to get the Antec Flux mid tower case before it went out of stock. I picked up all these parts in person at microcenter an hour away from me (except the Noctua fans, they didn't have the G2 LS models). So I defaulted back to the North case and couldn't be happier, although I have to return some of the extra fans. \n\nThis build is absolutely silent and the temps are 45 C for the CPU and 49 C for the GPU at idle. Build Pics and parts list are below. I gave you a gander at my full desk where I have my work standing desk. Still a lot of cable cleanup to do here but it is functional and I like that. I have been in this place for less than a year so still need to paint and add some art. Cheers to you and your builds. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/9g4md31](https://imgur.com/a/9g4md31)\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/b/q4gbt6](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/q4gbt6)",

I've had it paired with a 3080 since and still now, and while it performed great, I thought it should be better. I've played all the biggest releases on it getting decent fps on a mix high/max settings as I preferred my games to look good on my 1440p 144h monitor especially in single player games than try to reach my refresh rate and I was satisfied with it because I thought that was my ceiling for me! But holy SHIT I never thought with this card I could run battlefield 6 at MAX settings, 1440p, stream it on discord, and hover 100+ fps all with my new 7800x3d!!! It was on sale for at a microcenter near me for $299 and thought wow I had to purchase this right away. I am so glad I did. My gaming and even just doing simple computer task has never been better. I feel like I can run any game with this duo and I'm just so happy. Maybe it's the upgrade to DDR5 ram as well but wow if you're thinking about upgrading to the 7800x3d right now it's so good!!!! Just wanted to share hehe thank you for reading",

    "title": "Looking to build an editing/design PC",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone! So I'm looking to build a PC specifically dedicated for designing in programs like Photoshop and Blender, and I'm also learning how to edit in Davinci Resolve (I'm totally new to it) and desperately need a new PC as my current one can barely stay afloat anymore while even doing simple tasks in Photoshop. No RGB will be needed on this build as it'll be under my desk. \n\nMy budget is roughly around $3300 CAD ($2350 USD) but I'm willing to go over a bit by maybe $200-400 if it's really worth it. I've done some research via YouTube, here on Reddit, etc. and it seems like a CPU like the Ryzen 9 7950X is a very solid choice for all of the multitasking I'll be doing, but on the other hand I've heard great things about the Intel Core Ultra series and how favorable those CPUs are for video editing. I think I'll mostly be doing a lot of work designing (so a lot of Photoshop/Blender) but I'll be dabbling into editing here and there too, so I definitely need help with my CPU selection on this build. \n\nMy other concern is the GPU. I've chosen a 5070 Ti for this build as it seems like it's the best price/performance, but I could be wrong there. Would upgrading to a 5080 really be worth the extra money? I likely won't be video editing in anything higher than 4k (at least for now) but maybe future proofing to a 5080 could be worth it. Any other options would be great too.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to mention here is that I'd really love a case with good airflow. My current build has very poor airflow and gets hot very often, mostly because I chose a pretty mid-tier case as I built it 5 years ago and had a much lower budget back then. So if you know of any good cases with solid airflow, feel free to mention them/add them to the parts list. It doesn't need to be a huge case either. 50-55ish L is about perfect in terms of volume.\n\nMy last question here is that I'm thinking I should just wait for black Friday since I'm sure there will be tons of deals on these parts, but I'd honestly rather not wait that long, but if it's worth the wait for another month, let me know what you guys think.  \n  \nI'm going to link a few builds I've put together. Feel free to mess around with them as nothing is final, they're just ideas. Overall I think I have some solid choices, especially considering the budget. \n\nBuild 1 - [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/frwvJn](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/frwvJn)\n\nBuild 2 - [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/BkR7Lc](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/BkR7Lc) (Very similar to build 1, just not sure if PCIe 5.0 is better for what I'll be doing)  \n  \nBuild 3 - [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/HDwqFZ](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/HDwqFZ)  \n\n",

After noticing that the case came with 3 x 120 mm fans pre-installed in the front of the case for intake, my initial thought was to just return the 3-pack of fans I bought. However, I did some research and found out that the fans that come pre-installed in the case are not iCUE compatible. In my scenario, should I replace the pre-installed fans with the 3-pack of fans I bought? The reason why I ask is because my AIO is the Corsair Titan 360 RX, my two intake fans at the bottom are LX120-R, and the single exhaust fans in the back of my case is a RX120, so I thought it would be nice to have everything iCUE compatible. What would you do in my scenario? I would save about 80 bucks by returning the 3-pack of Corsair RX 120 mm fans and using the pre-installed fans. This is my first pc build so I'm unsure how bad it is to have different fans in the same build.",

The problem I have is deciding between a full-on upgrade, basically a new PC (AM4 -> AM5), or just getting a new GPU (and maybe more RAM) for now and upgrading the rest later. What would be the most cost-efficient way? Is AM5 such a big improvement that it makes sense to switch now? I would really like to upgrade over time, but idk if that's smart in my case. I would appreciate it to hear some opinions on what's best.

When I got this pc a few years back, it was when DDR5 was still new so I thought that 16gb DDR5 = 32gb DDR4 so I would be fine with 16. It seems I was very wrong and as more games need more ram my pc is struggling. It has gotten to the point where playing a few games my entire pc freezes. My only guess is that it is a ram overload issue. I am looking to upgrade with the coming up Black Friday sales, but I can't tell what works with my pc. I looked at my motherboard and the speeds it can go up to, and which ones are supported. However, I've also learned that CPU also matters in terms of speed and the ram being compatible? Can anyone possibly help, I don't want to spend on something that won't actually work. My goal is 32gb by 2 16gb sticks. I'm assuming more speed is better so whatever ram is close to the max my CPU/motherboard can do is probably what I want (unless advised against). Any help is very much appreciated.\n\n[https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/PRO-Z690-A-WIFI/support#mem](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/PRO-Z690-A-WIFI/support#mem)  \n  \nMy build:  \n\n* Motherboard - PRO Z690-A WIFI (DDR5 version) \n* CPU - Intel i7-12700K \n* GPU - Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti \n* Power - 750W (don't know if this matters but ill list it anyway)",

    "selftext": "Hi Everyone, \n\nIt has been about 5 years since I last upgraded my machine and instead of using the same case I had previously for 12 years (fractal define R4). I decided it's time for a ground up build. \n\nI like Racing and FPS and hope to have some racing simulator parts next year after bonus time. I did a lot of research on the parts of this build determining where the best price for performance was while still striving for the best. Say what you will about Nvidia the 5090 is the best card right now and I wanted 4K gaming for the next several years. I also work with LLMs and run things locally although my old PC will likely become the server where I run those workloads. Researching the AMD processors there were some really good youtube videos outlining the performance difference for 9950x3d vs. 9800 x3d and because they were within a few frames of each other I deciding to go with the 9800X3D. I don't do a ton of multithreaded work like content or code compilation. The rest of my choices stem from the fact the I love ASUS motherboards and the TUF style hardware and design. Obviously I am a big Noctua fan (haha) as well s the black and brown theme of the build was good to embrace their colors. \n\nI had seen the Fractal North years ago before it was available in the US and loved it bt I was actually going to get the Antec Flux mid tower case before it went out of stock. I picked up all these parts in person at microcenter an hour away from me (except the Noctua fans, they didn't have the G2 LS models). So I defaulted back to the North case and couldn't be happier, although I have to return some of the extra fans. \n\nThis build is absolutely silent and the temps are 45 C for the CPU and 49 C for the GPU at idle. Build Pics and parts list are below. I gave you a gander at my full desk where I have my work standing desk. Still a lot of cable cleanup to do here but it is functional and I like that. I have been in this place for less than a year so still need to paint and add some art. Cheers to you and your builds. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/9g4md31](https://imgur.com/a/9g4md31)\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/b/q4gbt6](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/q4gbt6)",

    "selftext": "Hi guys I just wanted to share my experience! I've always been Intel for the longest and been chilling on my i9 9900k since maybe 2020/21 and it's performed great for me ever since. I've had it paired with a 3080 since and still now, and while it performed great, I thought it should be better. I've played all the biggest releases on it getting decent fps on a mix high/max settings as I preferred my games to look good on my 1440p 144h monitor especially in single player games than try to reach my refresh rate and I was satisfied with it because I thought that was my ceiling for me! But holy SHIT I never thought with this card I could run battlefield 6 at MAX settings, 1440p, stream it on discord, and hover 100+ fps all with my new 7800x3d!!! It was on sale for at a microcenter near me for $299 and thought wow I had to purchase this right away. I am so glad I did. My gaming and even just doing simple computer task has never been better. I feel like I can run any game with this duo and I'm just so happy. Maybe it's the upgrade to DDR5 ram as well but wow if you're thinking about upgrading to the 7800x3d right now it's so good!!!! Just wanted to share hehe thank you for reading",

    "title": "Looking to build an editing/design PC",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone! So I'm looking to build a PC specifically dedicated for designing in programs like Photoshop and Blender, and I'm also learning how to edit in Davinci Resolve (I'm totally new to it) and desperately need a new PC as my current one can barely stay afloat anymore while even doing simple tasks in Photoshop. No RGB will be needed on this build as it'll be under my desk. \n\nMy budget is roughly around $3300 CAD ($2350 USD) but I'm willing to go over a bit by maybe $200-400 if it's really worth it. I've done some research via YouTube, here on Reddit, etc. and it seems like a CPU like the Ryzen 9 7950X is a very solid choice for all of the multitasking I'll be doing, but on the other hand I've heard great things about the Intel Core Ultra series and how favorable those CPUs are for video editing. I think I'll mostly be doing a lot of work designing (so a lot of Photoshop/Blender) but I'll be dabbling into editing here and there too, so I definitely need help with my CPU selection on this build. \n\nMy other concern is the GPU. I've chosen a 5070 Ti for this build as it seems like it's the best price/performance, but I could be wrong there. Would upgrading to a 5080 really be worth the extra money? I likely won't be video editing in anything higher than 4k (at least for now) but maybe future proofing to a 5080 could be worth it. Any other options would be great too.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to mention here is that I'd really love a case with good airflow. My current build has very poor airflow and gets hot very often, mostly because I chose a pretty mid-tier case as I built it 5 years ago and had a much lower budget back then. So if you know of any good cases with solid airflow, feel free to mention them/add them to the parts list. It doesn't need to be a huge case either. 50-55ish L is about perfect in terms of volume.\n\nMy last question here is that I'm thinking I should just wait for black Friday since I'm sure there will be tons of deals on these parts, but I'd honestly rather not wait that long, but if it's worth the wait for another month, let me know what you guys think.  \n  \nI'm going to link a few builds I've put together. Feel free to mess around with them as nothing is final, they're just ideas. Overall I think I have some solid choices, especially considering the budget. \n\nBuild 1 - [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/frwvJn](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/frwvJn)\n\nBuild 2 - [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/BkR7Lc](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/BkR7Lc) (Very similar to build 1, just not sure if PCIe 5.0 is better for what I'll be doing)  \n  \nBuild 3 - [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/HDwqFZ](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/HDwqFZ)  \n\n",

    "selftext": "Just for a bit of context, I bought an additional 3-pack of Corsair RX 120 mm fans, as I was unsure if there were any fans that came with the case. After noticing that the case came with 3 x 120 mm fans pre-installed in the front of the case for intake, my initial thought was to just return the 3-pack of fans I bought. However, I did some research and found out that the fans that come pre-installed in the case are not iCUE compatible. In my scenario, should I replace the pre-installed fans with the 3-pack of fans I bought? The reason why I ask is because my AIO is the Corsair Titan 360 RX, my two intake fans at the bottom are LX120-R, and the single exhaust fans in the back of my case is a RX120, so I thought it would be nice to have everything iCUE compatible. What would you do in my scenario? I would save about 80 bucks by returning the 3-pack of Corsair RX 120 mm fans and using the pre-installed fans. This is my first pc build so I'm unsure how bad it is to have different fans in the same build.",

I will also upgrade my Graphics Card later but want to do the two things separately. However, my motherboard can't take a more powerful CPU.

What are your thoughts.  \nJust for information's sake my current GPU is a GTX 2070 Super. And I'll probably switch to a 5070 Ti but that's about $750 I don't want to spend right now.

I mainly play shooters like Warzone or Valorant, but I also would like to be able to play GTA VI when it releases, so I'm thinking about upgrading. The problem I have is deciding between a full-on upgrade, basically a new PC (AM4 -> AM5), or just getting a new GPU (and maybe more RAM) for now and upgrading the rest later. What would be the most cost-efficient way? Is AM5 such a big improvement that it makes sense to switch now? I would really like to upgrade over time, but idk if that's smart in my case. I would appreciate it to hear some opinions on what's best.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe‚Äôve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It‚Äôs a fast, chaotic beat ‚Äôem up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who‚Äôs Mexican, and it‚Äôs directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt‚Äôs basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It‚Äôs been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo‚Äôs now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We‚Äôve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that‚Äôs part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I‚Äôll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pok√©mon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today¬†announced a new partnership¬†with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by¬†Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership.

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game‚Äôs many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroƒülu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2¬†is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If¬†The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the sameÔªø experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original‚Äôs formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player‚Äôs ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however‚Äîparticularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn‚Äôt a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste ‚Äì it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio‚Äôs vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I‚Äôll admit, there‚Äôs a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [S√∂nke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw ‚Äì it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine ‚Äî sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices ‚Äî all wrapped in Obsidian‚Äôs signature corporate satire. It‚Äôs funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it‚Äôs a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galv√£o](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved‚Äîbitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting‚Äîbut without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Micha≈Ç Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom‚Äîthough a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian‚Äôs brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland‚Äîalmost forgettable‚Äîcompanions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It‚Äôs a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn‚Äôt lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you‚Äôll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran ≈Ωalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you‚Äôll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avil√©s](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it‚Äôs the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could‚Äôve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It‚Äôs packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that‚Äôll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie‚Äôs Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It‚Äôs pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn‚Äôt Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of¬†The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but¬†TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

You can prove me wrong üòÄ\n\nGameplay consists of simple first person point-and-click mechanics. Where it stands out is interactivity. Environment is carefully hand-crafted with attention to detail, from the architecture of the buildings all the way down to the flushing sounds in the toilet.\n\nThe estimated length of the game is roughly 2 hours i would say. The length of the game depends on how fast you solve the puzzles. Some of them might be slightly on the more difficult side of the spectrum since they are a little bit unconventional.\n\n**Main features**\n\n* **Atmospheric first-person** mystery with light point-and-click style interactions.  \n* **Highly interactive environments** \\- almost everything reacts: drawers, switches, computers, instruments, sauna, etc.  \n* **Environmental storytelling**: newspapers, phones, and tiny props that hide clues.  \n* **Puzzles** that skew a bit **unconventional** \\- some are simple, a few are ‚Äúhuh‚Ä¶ wait‚Äù moments by design.  \n\nBuilt to reward **curiosity** and **note-taking** rather than brute forcing.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe‚Äôve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It‚Äôs a fast, chaotic beat ‚Äôem up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who‚Äôs Mexican, and it‚Äôs directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt‚Äôs basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It‚Äôs been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo‚Äôs now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We‚Äôve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that‚Äôs part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I‚Äôll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pok√©mon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

Started playing stuff 2-3 years late instead.\n\nTurns out it's way better. Games are cheaper, bugs are fixed, I know which ones are actually worth my time. Just finished God of War (2018) and it hit harder than most \"new\" experiences I've chased.\n\nNo pressure to rush through for discourse. Just me and a complete, polished game.\n\nAnyone else embrace being late to everything? It's honestly freeing.",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today¬†announced a new partnership¬†with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by¬†Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also¬†just broke¬†that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners‚Äîa group of investors‚Äîwould be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt‚Äôs basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It‚Äôs been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo‚Äôs now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We‚Äôve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that‚Äôs part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I‚Äôll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pok√©mon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

    "selftext": "So when I play games like apex, warzone, overwatch, or battlefield 6 etc I can't hear footsteps unless they're pretty much on me. Even if I go to the firing range and run I can't hear footsteps barely hear my own despite everything else like me shooting my gun, being super loud. Like loud enough to make me wince at the sound and have to turn the game down. I've tried three different headphones, the corsair hs80 which were my main headphones for a while, the drop pc38x which I got as an nice upgrade for self because I thought they would let me hear better, and just got the Logitech g pro x se as a sort of test because I saw some people saying the cause was the drop headphones being too good compared to the games' sound engines. Each one I have the same problem and I've tried messing with just about every in game audio setting I could. I've tried using the apple usb c dongle that was recommended as a fix for the drop headphones. My friends constantly say they hear people around and when spectating say like \"someone's running up behind you\" but I can't hear what they hear. They only thing that I've found to work is the windows loudness equalizer which made footsteps nice and loud at least in the firing range. But that made everything the same loudness pretty much and was a bit too loud for me and also made music sound kinda weird and I'm worried that would also apply to voice chat though having tried that. I am completely out of ideas does anybody have a clue about what might be the problem or am I just SOL",

I installed a Fractal PCIE3.0 riser in my Fractal CASE Define 7 when I built it, but I'm looking to replace the riser with a PCIE4.0, and since Fractal don't make a PCIE4.0 riser for this case (they only make the retrofit ones for cases that weren't designed for vertical mounts), I will need to source a riser from another manufacturer.\n\nMy question is this: how likely is it that another manufacturer's riser will fit in my case (screw holes to mount the base)? Are they all to an industry standard, or are they all different? None of them specify and guage or distance for their fixing points.",

So I tested RoboCop and tried to optimize my settings based off of 4070 super GPU. I also \nhave Ryzen 7 5700X3D. So I know my PC can handle things because I‚Äôve played cyberpunk and recently silent Hill F with zero issues. But anyways, when I opened RoboCop and started playing for a bit, it was running smoothly and then my PC randomly shut off entirely. When I turned it back on now, I have this yellow light and nothing else is working. I looked it up and it looks like I have to plug everything back in, but I just wanna make sure if anyone has had a similar issue because of war frame. Or if any advice or tips in case making sure all the slots are plugged in properly doesn‚Äôt work",

    "selftext": "Video between my main monitor on the left using DisplayPort and my second monitor on the right using my old HDMI.\n\nFor starting, I‚Äôve been using a (main monitor) LG 27inch 1440p 144hz monitor for a few years now with a HDMI cord. I‚Äôve decided to get a second monitor which is a LG 27inch 1440p 100hz monitor and had to use my HDMI for the second monitor. I switch my main monitor to a DisplayPort Cable because I heard it‚Äôs better in general but after switching to DP I‚Äôve noice that there‚Äôs a weird lag when I scroll or move this around on my main monitor, it looks like there‚Äôs laggy white pixels after I move things around (kind of like a flashing white light following whatever I‚Äôm moving). I‚Äôve tried multiple different DP cable and still have this issue.\n\nMainly asking if there‚Äôs a way to fix this in settings or if I need a better Cable.\n\nI have a RTX 3070ti and I am using a 1.4 Display Cable that is supported up to 8k60hz, 4k144hz, 2k240hz.\n\nIf anyone can provide some insight that would be greatly appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Hello guys,\n\nThis is my first time asking a question on here, because this is the first problem I have been unable to solve by myself by looking online for an answer. I have been getting some really weird stutters ever since I built my new pc a few months ago.\n\nSo for some context, I have around 610 hours on Elden Ring and I never had any issues on my old rig, which was a Ryzen 2600x with a 3060ti and 16gb of Ram on a 1080p monitor. But now on my new pc, which is a Ryzen 7600x with a 5070ti and 32gb of Ram on 1440p, I have been getting some annoying stutters on Elden Ring. Weirdly this only happens on this game, every other game gets amazing performance as expected from this rig. The one clue I have been able to find is in the steam overlay, I can see the right cpu usage stat (highest single core) shoot up to 90%-120% around the time I freeze/stutter. The average cpu usage is usually around 40%-60% and sometimes around 70%-80% but not often. I have tried many of the generic fixes found online to Elden Ring stuttering and nothing seems to work. Does anybody know what could be causing this and maybe how to fix it? \n\nI am kind of tired today to try anything but will read all suggestions and try them tomorrow, thanks everyone! ",

Sometimes it‚Äôs floaty, inconsistent, or delayed.\n\nAfter endless reinstalls, BIOS tweaks, DPC tuning, driver testing, etc‚Ä¶ I noticed it only feels right when something about the display/EDID changes.\n\nThe EDID (the monitor‚Äôs info file telling your GPU about its specs) seems to break or get read wrong, causing:\n\t‚Ä¢\tFlat, stretched image\n\t‚Ä¢\tNo color depth / bad contrast\n\t‚Ä¢\tSubtle timing issues between GPU & display\n\t‚Ä¢\tVisual latency (even though FPS & latency tools look fine)\n\nthe big problem is that none of the above can be really measured, because your GPU is doing the right scaling at the right time in the right color format, Your screen just doesnt display it right. So no matter where you look your settings will tell you you did everything right. \nyour latency will look good your fps be as always.\n\nBut a really fcked up stretched no depth wrong colour unconsistent Image on your screen will tell you your player moves slow or your mouse moves fast or uncontrollable, while actually it just looks really wrong. The concept is the same as running in Minecraft with 115 FOV feeling way faster than with 80.  Now while its great that i feel like i know that this is the issue I still cannot get it to work consistently every time it works and i restart my pc or i change a setting on my Display or ingame or sometimes just after a bit of time the screen flickers and its back to reinstalling graphics drivers 300 times till i get lucky and get the right EDID. \n\nDoes anybody have an Idea how this problem can be fixed ? \n\nThanks <3",

    "selftext": "In AAA games  like Battlefield 6 I am around  80-100 fps with pretty much everything on low settings.  It drops to 60-70 sometimes when the chaotic action begins. When I turn DLSS on the frame rate counter shows 155 fps. Sweet. But it looks and feels like 40 fps. When DLSS is off I \"FEEL\" the 80 fps, and when it's on it says 155 but litteraly feels liek 40 fps. It feels like these frames are just wasted and not displayed. My monitor is 144Hz and I have no issue with other games. It only happens in BF6, Warzone, and other AAAs.\n\nI would really appreciate it if anyone has an explanation and solutions to this problem.  \nCheers\n\nSorry if i'm supposed to say Frame-gen instead of DLSS, i'm still noob\n\nSpecs\n\n* ASUS TUF F15 laptop\n* 15.6-inch, FHD (1920 x 1080) 16:9 144hz monitor\n* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU\n* 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700H\n* 16GB DDR5\n* TWindows x64",

What could be the cause or causes of it?\n\nFor context:\n\nMonitor 360Hz so capable of max 360fps. When not using v-sync, i can easily get 600fps in Hades (not sure if maintained though). I do use g-sync so it will stay at 360fps, however it will drop to 320 on occasion, or 340, then up to 360 most of the time.\n\nI am wondering why these drops when clearly the hardware has enough headroom.\n\nResolution: 1440p\n\nGPU: 4070 Super\n\nCPU: 7600x\n\nRAM: DDR5 6000 cl30\n\n  \nThanks for your comments.\n\n",

Swapped out the mobo, cpu, and ram and went team red. Have yet to regret it. +20-30 FPS on most games at 1440p, and even more of a boost on other cpu heavy games. I will admit intel has its upsides, such as 20 cores for $130 less than the AMD 8 core cpu, and less stability issues such as with monitoring softwares and stuff. But, the 3D cache on the AMD chip really enhances gaming on the PC. Super smooth, less stutters, and cooler temps. \nOn Marvel Rivals. GPU usage went from jumping between 70-85% sometimes reaching over 90% with the i7, to consistently using 95-99% with the Ryzen 7 at the same graphics settings. My FPS on average went up by around 30-60, and 1% lows went from around 110-120 to 140-160 FPS.\n \nTLDR; Swapped i7-14700k for R7 9800X3D. Pretty confident I made the right decision.",

    "selftext": "Tldr: pc keep crashing under high load for a week but suddenly stop crashing but turned to having a burnt plastic smell under high load, warranty ran the GPU for a week and no burnt smell.\n\nSo a bit of a long story here, it happened a while ago and all of a sudden one night my pc crashed in a weird way, display crashed but the pc is technically still on, the rgb is on but reverted to the default state(I set my rgb to whiteish closed but it went to the default rainbow color when crash)\n\nI didn't thought much of it and just forced stop my pc via the power button(cuz I can't click power off) but then the crashed just keep happening. I found out my pc crash under high load so I kept running furmark and go through event viewer to see what goes wrong. However I get multiple kinda of error, I remember it include something about ram and sometimes display driver. I was puzzled and scratched my head for a weak trying to fix it.\n\nThen the most bizzar thing happened. All of a sudden it stopped crashing. I left furmark running before I left home and it was still running 3 hours after I came back. I thought the problem was solved but then I smell the burnt plastic smell. I took it apart and smelled it myself and thought it came from the GPU but I sent it to warranty repair and the stressed test it for a week and it's not it?\n\nI don't know what is wrong now, usually when there is a burnt small I thought the pc won't even boot, let alone go high load. I'm scare to run it too much cuz it's ok for now but it may really be burnt beyond the way of return if I run it more. Does anyone know what could be wrong? My best guess is the power supply since maybe the GPU fan sucked up the burnt smell from the power supply below it? Any insight would be appreciated.",

The integration of the standby clock together with the mirrored view of the O11 Vision Chrome, gave a very good finish, where you can only observe the screen without the edges.\n\nThe only point of attention:\n\nIt was not possible to use the tapes that came with the screen. I used velcro so that there was space to keep the rubbers in place and be easy to remove for future cleaning routines. \n\nIf you have a CPU-STRIMER like me, it can be difficult to place due to the available space and the tension that the wires make pressing the screen. But once again, velcro solved this problem.\n\nFor those who want something new on their PC in addition to the hardware, it is a good aesthetic option.",

Swapped out the mobo, cpu, and ram and went team red. Have yet to regret it. +20-30 FPS on most games at 1440p, and even more of a boost on other cpu heavy games. I will admit intel has its upsides, such as 20 cores for $130 less than the AMD 8 core cpu, and less stability issues such as with monitoring softwares and stuff. But, the 3D cache on the AMD chip really enhances gaming on the PC. Super smooth, less stutters, and cooler temps. \nOn Marvel Rivals. GPU usage went from jumping between 70-85% sometimes reaching over 90% with the i7, to consistently using 95-99% with the Ryzen 7 at the same graphics settings. My FPS on average went up by around 30-60, and 1% lows went from around 110-120 to 140-160 FPS.\n \nTLDR; Swapped i7-14700k for R7 9800X3D. Pretty confident I made the right decision.",

    "selftext": "So I am currently searching for a new prebuilt PC as my current one is now. I think, more than 6 years old, and I need an upgrade. Now here is the thing I don't care at all about graphics. I am actively searching for something that works best at 1080p, but I want it to be perfect (based on my around 1k budget) in everything else. I want to be able to edit videos, play heavy games, do 10 different things at the same time across 2 monitors, etc. and most importantly, I want it to hold up to a decent level even 5 years later.  \n\n\nHere are my current specs as a reference:  \nCPU: Intel Core i7-7700 @ 3.60 GHz,  \nRAM: 16 GB DDR4,  \nMotherboard: ASUS H110M-A/M.2,  \nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB,  \nStorage: 240 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD,  \nPC Model: CSL  \n\n\nIf any more info is needed, ask away. I would really appreciate some help as a purchase, as I can only do it once every 5 years, so I want to do it right. Germany btw.\n\nPS: (At the same time, if there are any decent mic recommendations that don't cost multiple hundreds, throw them in.)",

I've made some upgrades based on suggestions + you can all see the full picture of my space I've been talking about (ie where the podcaster is now + mics etc and other side of the wall)\n\n**Check pictures here:** [**WIDE VIEW**](https://freeimage.host/i/pxl-20251025-011046826mp.Kr7j1zg) **|** [**CLOSE VIEW**](https://freeimage.host/i/pxl-20251025-011325535mp.Kr7kK9p)\n\n1. Added riser under monitor\n2. Added keybo/mouse pad (my old one, ordered new one to test)\n3. Added a power shelf under the table on the right\n4. FIXED the monitor tilt, more cable management, tucked computer away behind bar\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\n1. Waiting on new shelf and plants.\n2. Ordered a pegboard as well for charging station\n3. New larger grey scale mouse pad\n4. Headphones modern stand coming in Monday\n\nThank you all for the recommendations and trolling :P was fun!  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Original Post  \nFinally got around revamping my work station.\n\n* Used the [74\" IKEA Kitchen KIRBY Walnut Veneer Table Top](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/karlby-countertop-for-kitchen-island-walnut-veneer-30297641/#content)\n* Got a welder to custom build legs for me\n* Bought square leg risers to add some height + have padding on the bottom of the feet.\n* Added LED lights from Temu\n* Cable management under the monitor area via Amazon\n* Monitor arm from Amazon as well\n* Yamaha HS7 Monitor + Amazon Stands (I wish the stands were shorter but the smaller ones couldn't handle the weight)\n\nMy computer is tucked in the back under, it doesnt stick out...just an early picture ( I built without lights for the first time thinking I wouldn't care lol, wish I got a sick case, but oh well)\n\nWaiting for blackfriday to get a new chair as the current one is too old.\n\nI wanted to add shelving so I bought one but not sure where to add it lol. The left of the table is a window in the basement that throws off the whole look. I will upload an updated picture but thought I would post this to get some feedback in the meantime!",

    "selftext": "https://reddit.com/link/1ohqnll/video/3yg1upjhypxf1/player\n\nI made my first switch customization to my ZSA Moonlander Mark 1, and I love it. I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks ‚Äî band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast üôÇ.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me ‚Äî in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn‚Äôt make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they‚Äôll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly ‚Äî The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay‚Äôs voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away ‚Üí Roxette**  \nI‚Äôm still in love with Marie Fredriksson‚Äôs voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 ‚Üí Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele ‚Äî the man, the music, the attitude ‚Äî pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F ‚Üí Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The ‚Äú3‚Äù also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit ‚Äî Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 ‚Üí 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it‚Äôs probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive ‚Üí** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently‚Äôs Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt‚Äôs pure freedom, soul, happiness ‚Äî life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins‚Ä¶ and hopefully Bart‚Äôs story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy ‚Äî build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power ‚Üí N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote ‚Äútuurnn‚Äù next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in ‚Äî just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane ‚Üí** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane ‚Äî the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations ‚Üí** had to be here anyway, but this one‚Äôs a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song‚Äôs energy, Mark‚Äôs wild teenage years, his early work ‚Äî all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we‚Äôre at it‚Ä¶\n\n**P.I.J M.M ‚Üí Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite ‚Äî the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE ‚Üí Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come Through* would‚Äôve been too many ‚Äúdreams‚Äù ‚Äî and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire ‚Üí Scooter (HP Baxxter‚Äôs voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in P√©cs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously ‚Äî the best element!\n\n**Out of Space ‚Üí The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under ‚ÄúSpace‚Äù, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune‚Äôs ‚ÄúI was sent to outer space,‚Äù and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can‚Äôt Stop Raving* didn‚Äôt fit anymore üòÖ.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True ‚Üí** basically the slogan of the ‚Äô90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven‚Äôt outgrown it ‚Äî and honestly, ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù was never my strong suit üôÇ.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? ‚Üí** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I‚Äôve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here ‚Äî sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt need explaining, but I shouldn‚Äôt forget it either.\n* **NRG** ‚Äî same energy.\n* **Music** ‚Äî the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** ‚Äî clich√©, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** ‚Äî probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** ‚Äî took a while to find. Wanted something that says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fit in boxes,‚Äù kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** ‚Äî because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** ‚Äî as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** ‚Äî one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny ‚Äú-drive,‚Äù because if it‚Äôs worth doing, it‚Äôs worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn‚Äôt stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches‚Ä¶ the works.\n\nThat‚Äôs about all that fit ‚Äî for now.  \nI‚Äôve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer ‚Äî brush smears the paint, and I don‚Äôt want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the¬†***Logitech G915 TKL***¬†and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the¬†*G515*¬†with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the¬†***Keychron K1 Max***¬†with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using¬†[launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/)¬†but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use¬†[usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

Big win for us all!\n\nI'm a big fan of marbley sounds and the Hi75 is the perfect model for this. Even stock, this thing sounded great.\nI tried HMX Canglan switches on this board, which sounded great but had a more muted and thocky sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the MMD Princesses which had a slightly higher-pitched sound, which I think really helps with the marbley sound as opposed to a more deep and flat sound. I was inspired by sound tests like [this one with MMD Princesses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2iPPrgfkIo) and [this one with Epomaker Jade Blossoms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9EoDIbE9OU) which sound basically perfect to me. The former is more like what my build sounds like IRL so I'm over the moon with the sound, but I still have Jade Blossoms on the way to see what they sound like as well.\n\nI'm also pleasantly surprised by these Osume keycaps. Not only do I like the non-standard legends and gradient colors from top to bottom, the packaging itself was very thoughtful (all rows separated in different trays, and individual places in the trays labeled, as opposed to all keycaps in one enormous tray with no labeling to help). And of course as a Taiwanese guy, I loved these novelties and had to spring for those as well. :)\n\nOverall this is the most perfect build I've ever made and I'm so happy with what the market looks like in 2025.",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Found bigger silicone bumpons that dont sink into deskpads completely, fixing ‚Äúthudding‚Äù. input parts number 107091 into [Here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/), order a reasonable amount and should deliver it to you for free\n\n\nNowadays I‚Äôve been noticing that some keyboards like the Frog Mini and some if the newer Neo boards having issues with how it sounds. This is mostly due to those keyboards having pretty short feet leading to the bottom of the keyboard to touch your deskpad as it compresses due to the weight of the keyboard which causes it to ‚Äúthud‚Äù. \n\nI‚Äôve had issues with this in the past since I use a XSoft mousepad from LethalGamingGear. When i put my keyboard on my mousepad it at first sounds fine, but as the keyboard starts to sink down due to its weight, i start to hear vibrations and ‚Äúthudding‚Äù from the desk.\n\nWhile building a drawer from ikea, i noticed that it came with some silicone bumpons to reduce the noise from the contact of the wood. And now compared to the normal hemisphere silicone bumpons that keyboards usually come with, these are a bit bigger. So I thought to try them on a keyboard that is thudding, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, tall enough so that the bottom does not touch my mousepad. I did some searching to see where i can find more of these and lo and behold, ikea actually gives them for free. Simply go to the [IKEA spare parts](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/) website and input part number 107091 and it should show up. Each one comes in a pack of 2 so as long as you order a reasonable amount, they should give them to you for free delivered straight to you.\n\nEDIT: Size for comparison. Smaller original feet are from a JJW Moment https://imgur.com/a/T48CUmH",

All keys are working, only one caveat: the upper left LED is not blinking, but I am not a LED guy and its switched off any way (been using Das Keyboard Ultimate with unlabeled keys for years). Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "title": "Chilkey Slice68 HE Review",
    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or ‚Äúmovement‚Äù, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom ‚Äúclacky‚Äù WS Flux HE switches as well as the ‚Äúdeep clacky‚Äù WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

All are connected to my PC at the same time (don‚Äôt ask) and I just grab one depending on what I‚Äôm doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn‚Äôt want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator.

    "selftext": "\n\nA flat typing surface is not very comfortable. Most keyboards solve this problem by using profiled keycaps that form the general shape of a curve. However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws: ‚ÄÉ\n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks ‚Äî band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast üôÇ.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me ‚Äî in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn‚Äôt make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they‚Äôll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly ‚Äî The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay‚Äôs voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away ‚Üí Roxette**  \nI‚Äôm still in love with Marie Fredriksson‚Äôs voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 ‚Üí Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele ‚Äî the man, the music, the attitude ‚Äî pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F ‚Üí Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The ‚Äú3‚Äù also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit ‚Äî Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 ‚Üí 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it‚Äôs probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive ‚Üí** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently‚Äôs Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt‚Äôs pure freedom, soul, happiness ‚Äî life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins‚Ä¶ and hopefully Bart‚Äôs story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy ‚Äî build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power ‚Üí N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote ‚Äútuurnn‚Äù next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in ‚Äî just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane ‚Üí** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane ‚Äî the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations ‚Üí** had to be here anyway, but this one‚Äôs a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song‚Äôs energy, Mark‚Äôs wild teenage years, his early work ‚Äî all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we‚Äôre at it‚Ä¶\n\n**P.I.J M.M ‚Üí Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite ‚Äî the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE ‚Üí Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come Through* would‚Äôve been too many ‚Äúdreams‚Äù ‚Äî and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire ‚Üí Scooter (HP Baxxter‚Äôs voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in P√©cs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously ‚Äî the best element!\n\n**Out of Space ‚Üí The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under ‚ÄúSpace‚Äù, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune‚Äôs ‚ÄúI was sent to outer space,‚Äù and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can‚Äôt Stop Raving* didn‚Äôt fit anymore üòÖ.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True ‚Üí** basically the slogan of the ‚Äô90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven‚Äôt outgrown it ‚Äî and honestly, ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù was never my strong suit üôÇ.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? ‚Üí** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I‚Äôve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here ‚Äî sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt need explaining, but I shouldn‚Äôt forget it either.\n* **NRG** ‚Äî same energy.\n* **Music** ‚Äî the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** ‚Äî clich√©, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** ‚Äî probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** ‚Äî took a while to find. Wanted something that says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fit in boxes,‚Äù kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** ‚Äî because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** ‚Äî as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** ‚Äî one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny ‚Äú-drive,‚Äù because if it‚Äôs worth doing, it‚Äôs worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn‚Äôt stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches‚Ä¶ the works.\n\nThat‚Äôs about all that fit ‚Äî for now.  \nI‚Äôve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer ‚Äî brush smears the paint, and I don‚Äôt want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

I've paired the build with a purple and green Owlab Voice Mini, and MW Fright Night deskmat. \n\nThere's nothing better than combining multiple multiple purchases into one solid theme.

I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

At work, I use a 24+24 setup with my work laptop. \n\nWhile I like the simplicity of a single monitor, I like the dual monitor setup better for multi-tasking.

I have seen lots of good reviews on the **AOC G3 Q27G3XMN.** Also open for other advice on why I should get something else.",

The one or two reviews that I've read have been positive. The biggest issue with the monitor is that there is no audio jack or speakers.\n2. Soundbar: [**LG S70TY**](https://www.lg.com/in/audio/soundbars/s70ty/?srsltid=AfmBOopg5fa8Xxf7ZpRkg5WpMWBGpGGmDqAzjiQx0yf0jguy2I8imCFC) \\- It is 3.1.1. It has atmos but is useless for me but I like that it has HDMI In and HDMI Out and VRR at 60hz.\n3. Standing desk: Jinoffice 3 stage dual motor desk\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n* Personal laptop + work laptop + PS5 ‚Üí **HDMI 2.0 hub**\n* Hub output ‚Üí **HDMI In (Soundbar)**\n* Soundbar HDMI Out ‚Üí **Monitor HDMI 1**\n\nWhen I eventually get a PC:\n\n* PC DisplayPort **‚Üí Monitor** (for full refresh, VRR / G-Sync / FreeSync)\n* PC HDMI **‚Üí same HDMI Hub** (for audio to the soundbar)\n\nThen I‚Äôll just switch between **HDMI** or **DP** on the monitor. DP for the PC, HDMI for the other devices.\n\n**My only complaint:**\n\nI‚Äôm limited to **VRR @ 60 Hz** through the soundbar, or **fixed 120 Hz**. I was hoping I could get full VRR at 120hz. But given my budget this is the best I can do. \n\n**Alternative:**\n\nI can sacrifice the soundbar and add the money saved to buy a better monitor (with in-built speakers, yes they are terrible), but at that new budget I am lost as to which one to buy.\n\n**PS:** \n\n1. Overall even though it is frustrating, honestly I actually learnt quite a lot things.  \n2. In case I missed something or got somethings wrong, I am not an expert so please don't bash me. \n\n",

To fit a monitor vertically, it would have to have a width of less than 18.5\", which I've discovered virtually does not exist. To keep it from being huge, I have searched for any slightly higher quality square/4:3 monitors, but I have discovered that those, too, simply do not exist.\n\n(For reference, [this ](https://www.amazon.com/SKitphrati-Inch-Monitor-Color-Correction/dp/B09KZP5J3S?crid=1195BAY9HNYJA&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kzeFVrja8FuGmR_heQoYfU6b3pF6FLdqsySrsnU64-CbWrREzhzBIDevyNoT6zOQwDgkhjuN2sKd_rqwHN-GZCnmeJ8Qry2wJZZfMCJN1dr5L40An8-Zm30YbEjPvs2XvPxjpv0YigIzDduvRAQHXDzGCuDOr6oOZVPKWjFHvfoLRiG7ePvLlaWncLi0G6LpGXnk16-iqQzE1ZYjU3wmDuof0VbTtbEjo13p79cU6D4.SGFZbOIp2vQr2vh_Uzg4gyuunoiFBZC8uUpx17HTn10&dib_tag=se&keywords=square%2Bmonitor&qid=1761575338&sprefix=square%2Bmonito%2Caps%2C251&sr=8-4&th=1)is what I have right now. it works about as well as you'd think)\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations, or am I doomed to suffer eternally at the hands of my no-space desk?",

    "selftext": "After exhausting every troubleshooting step to get VRR/FreeSync working on a G-Sync Compatible monitor, it's reasonable to stop when the issue persists despite correctly applying all recommended settings\n. In many cases, especially with non-certified \"G-Sync Compatible\" setups, minor stutters can be inherent due to imperfect hardware or software implementations. \nWhen to give up\nYou should consider stopping when you've done all the following and still see no improvement:\n\n    Verified all basic setup requirements, including using a DisplayPort cable and ensuring VRR is enabled in your monitor's OSD, NVIDIA Control Panel, and in-game settings.\n    Applied advanced optimization techniques, such as capping your in-game frame rate a few frames below your monitor's maximum refresh rate and setting V-Sync to \"On\" in the NVIDIA Control Panel but \"Off\" in-game.\n    Investigated other software issues, like disabling overlays (such as NVIDIA's or the Xbox Game Bar), checking for background applications, and ensuring you have the latest drivers installed.\n    Performed a clean re-installation of drivers using a tool like DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller).\n    Accepted that the problem might be hardware-related. For instance, some users on OLED monitors report persistent VRR flicker that is unfixable, as it may be tied to the display technology itself. \n\nWhat to do instead\nIf you've given up on getting a flawless VRR experience, here are some alternatives to improve your gameplay:\n1. Cap your frame rate\nThis is often the most effective and simplest solution for avoiding stuttering and screen tearing.\n\n    Disable all adaptive sync in your monitor settings and the NVIDIA Control Panel.\n    Cap your frame rate in-game or using a tool like RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS) to your monitor's refresh rate (e.g., cap at 144 FPS for a 144 Hz monitor).\n    Turn V-Sync on in the NVIDIA Control Panel and in-game. This will eliminate screen tearing and keep frame times stable, though it may introduce some input lag. \n\n2. Use Fast Sync or Enhanced Sync\nThese are GPU driver features designed to reduce tearing and input lag without forcing a fixed refresh rate.\n\n    Enable Fast Sync (NVIDIA) or Enhanced Sync (AMD) in your GPU control panel instead of standard V-Sync.\n    Ensure adaptive sync is off. This can be a good compromise for competitive games where low input lag is a priority. \n\n3. Accept screen tearing\nFor competitive gamers who prioritize the absolute lowest input lag above all else, the standard practice is to:\n\n    Disable adaptive sync and V-Sync entirely.\n    This will allow your GPU to render frames as fast as possible, but you will experience screen tearing when your frame rate is out of sync with your monitor. \n\nThe bottom line\nYou've likely done all you can. The \"G-Sync Compatible\" label on some FreeSync monitors is an imperfect standard, and it's not uncommon for users to experience issues that a certified G-Sync module would prevent. The time and effort spent troubleshooting can reach a point of diminishing returns. The best path forward is to find a configuration that provides the best balance of smoothness and low input lag for your specific use case, even if that means abandoning VRR altogether. ",

If it's exactly $300 or a few dollars over I am okay with that, just not at or past $350  preferably. I'm not very knowledgable in monitors but I would like it to have nice vibrant colors and come from well known brands like LG, Alienware, ASUS, Acer, etc. Doesn't have to be those specifically, just any kind of monitor brand that is well known and reliable. My main game is Overwatch 2 if that helps at all in giving me suggestions. I am NOT looking for OLED suggestions as they are far out of my budget. The refresh rate cannot be under 240 but I'm all for anything higher than that if it would still fit in my budget (which I doubt lol). I also ONLY want it to be 1440p. Nothing lower or higher than that resolution. If you have any more questions about my preferences feel free to ask. Thank you in advance for any help given!",

I had to do a lot of stuff for university including coding and all of that. I'm currently using a MacBook Air (15\"). I bought the 15 inch because I heard it's better if you have a larger screen it's not as bad for your eyes compared to a smaller 13\" screen. But I somehow feel like it's still bad for my eyes.\n\nAs far as I know, my laptop has a LCD screen. Would an OLED be better? I also use a lamp behind my laptop because I've heard (and read) that also helps against eye strain. If I got something like a 28 or 30 inch OLED screen, would that be a lot better? If that is the case, can someone recommend me a good external display that I can connect via USB C?\n\nI don't know if it's the stress (bc of exams and all the studying) or working on my laptop for 4-6 hours daily.

I hope y'all are well.\n\nI don't really have a lot of knowledge regarding monitors, but I would like to start to look for a new one.\n\nRight now I have the Odyssey G6 (since almost 2 years) for my PS5 Pro.\nIt is not bad but I got it because of the integrated OS and a good sale at that time. It definitely has some flaws.\n\nNow I really want to focus more on the performance, so I guess 4k, HDMI 2.1 and 120 hz should be a must have. The question now is should I go with a normal IPS, a Mini LED or OLED. First problem is, OLED is too expensive.\n\nI looked a little bit into RTINGS and when I compared their ratings for OLED and Mini LED, the OLED monitors had *much* higher ratings which surprised me, because I always see good feedback to Mini LEDs here in this subreddit.\nThen again OLED is too expensive. The only affordable monitor they recommended is the ASUS ROG Strix OLED XG27ACDNG for 689‚Ç¨. It got also a really nice review but it is not 4k, unfortunately.\n\nBecause of the price I was tending more to Mini LED, but after seeing the ratings on RTINGS and that big difference in comparison to OLED I am really not sure anymore.\n\nIs there anything I need to know? Anything specific I should look at?\n\nYour help will be much appreciated ü•≤",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI‚Äôm stuck deciding between the Gigabyte MO27Q28G (matte finish) and the ASUS ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG (glossy finish).\n\nI really like the Gigabyte but I‚Äôm worried that the matte coating might take away from that sharp, vibrant OLED look. I‚Äôve been using a matte 1080p VA monitor for years, so I‚Äôm used to matte panels, but I keep hearing that glossy OLEDs just *look* so much better.\n\nFor context, I have a window on the left side of my monitor, about 2.5‚Äì3.5 meters away, and the sunlight hits directly through it during the day, so glare could definitely be an issue.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs seen or owned both:\n\n* How noticeable is the matte coating on the Gigabyte‚Äôs 4th-gen OLED?\n* Does it really dull the image or reduce that ‚ÄúOLED pop‚Äù?\n* Is the glossy ASUS worth dealing with possible reflections?\n\nWould love to hear real-world impressions or side-by-side comparisons ‚Äî I‚Äôm honestly torn between them.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, just bought a LG 27MR400-B, it's a cheap IPS monitor that I could buy with my budget. Now it doesn't have any dead pixels, but in a completely black screen I noticed this. Now they say every IPS panel has some backlight bleed, but is this enough to refund my monitor? Or it's not that much and I should live with it.\nPersonally, I don't notice it in normal usage, but in a completely black screen I can notice it a little, mostly when I look at my monitor far from it. \nThe picture I took is my monitor at 95 percent brightness and in reality it looks less obvious because my phone's camera makes it more obvious. \nThanks in advance guys, it's my first time buying a monitor and sorry if I sound very rookie.\nedit: I'm not an enthusiast and also I'm not a gamer, I just want my laptop for light video editing and programming, so don't consider me an enthusiast and consider me an average usage, so guys, please tell me if it's bearable for an average user. \n\nEdit: Thank you guys for all of the good and heartwarming comments, I mean it. But can you check it twice with your brightness high, I think it would appear more obvious when you look at the picture with high brightness.",

Monitor: [**Alienware AW2725DM**](https://www.dell.com/en-in/shop/alienware-27-qhd-gaming-monitor-aw2725dm/apd/210-bqqg/monitors-monitor-accessories) \\- I like the specs. There aren't many reviews. The one or two reviews that I've read have been positive. The biggest issue with the monitor is that there is no audio jack or speakers.\n2. Soundbar: [**LG S70TY**](https://www.lg.com/in/audio/soundbars/s70ty/?srsltid=AfmBOopg5fa8Xxf7ZpRkg5WpMWBGpGGmDqAzjiQx0yf0jguy2I8imCFC) \\- It is 3.1.1. It has atmos but is useless for me but I like that it has HDMI In and HDMI Out and VRR at 60hz.\n3. Standing desk: Jinoffice 3 stage dual motor desk\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n* Personal laptop + work laptop + PS5 ‚Üí **HDMI 2.0 hub**\n* Hub output ‚Üí **HDMI In (Soundbar)**\n* Soundbar HDMI Out ‚Üí **Monitor HDMI 1**\n\nWhen I eventually get a PC:\n\n* PC DisplayPort **‚Üí Monitor** (for full refresh, VRR / G-Sync / FreeSync)\n* PC HDMI **‚Üí same HDMI Hub** (for audio to the soundbar)\n\nThen I‚Äôll just switch between **HDMI** or **DP** on the monitor. DP for the PC, HDMI for the other devices.\n\n**My only complaint:**\n\nI‚Äôm limited to **VRR @ 60 Hz** through the soundbar, or **fixed 120 Hz**. I was hoping I could get full VRR at 120hz. But given my budget this is the best I can do. \n\n**Alternative:**\n\nI can sacrifice the soundbar and add the money saved to buy a better monitor (with in-built speakers, yes they are terrible), but at that new budget I am lost as to which one to buy.\n\n**PS:** \n\n1. Overall even though it is frustrating, honestly I actually learnt quite a lot things.  \n2. In case I missed something or got somethings wrong, I am not an expert so please don't bash me. \n\n",

I'm planning on upgrading to a nicer main monitor.\n\nFor my second monitor, I've wanted to keep it small--I only really use it for youtube or having wikis pulled up.

To fit a monitor vertically, it would have to have a width of less than 18.5\", which I've discovered virtually does not exist. To keep it from being huge, I have searched for any slightly higher quality square/4:3 monitors, but I have discovered that those, too, simply do not exist.\n\n(For reference, [this ](https://www.amazon.com/SKitphrati-Inch-Monitor-Color-Correction/dp/B09KZP5J3S?crid=1195BAY9HNYJA&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kzeFVrja8FuGmR_heQoYfU6b3pF6FLdqsySrsnU64-CbWrREzhzBIDevyNoT6zOQwDgkhjuN2sKd_rqwHN-GZCnmeJ8Qry2wJZZfMCJN1dr5L40An8-Zm30YbEjPvs2XvPxjpv0YigIzDduvRAQHXDzGCuDOr6oOZVPKWjFHvfoLRiG7ePvLlaWncLi0G6LpGXnk16-iqQzE1ZYjU3wmDuof0VbTtbEjo13p79cU6D4.SGFZbOIp2vQr2vh_Uzg4gyuunoiFBZC8uUpx17HTn10&dib_tag=se&keywords=square%2Bmonitor&qid=1761575338&sprefix=square%2Bmonito%2Caps%2C251&sr=8-4&th=1)is what I have right now. it works about as well as you'd think)\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations, or am I doomed to suffer eternally at the hands of my no-space desk?",

The **1500R curve** adds immersive depth, while **FreeSync support** ensures tear-free performance. Its **VA panel** provides excellent contrast, though viewing angles and dark-scene motion aren‚Äôt quite at IPS or OLED levels. The HDR performance is decent but not exceptional, and the stand lacks some ergonomic flexibility. Still, for its price, this monitor delivers remarkable value‚Äîperfect for gamers seeking **high refresh QHD performance** without overspending.

    "selftext": "I'm looking at buying a new budget monitor after living my whole life at 60Hz. These two options (MSI G244F E2 and AOC 24G4XE) caught my eye, as they are similar in price in my area. MSI is just a tiny bit cheaper. I mostly use my pc for gaming and coding. \n\n  \nThe reviews I saw online said that the AOC had some color problems but they could be fixed with a drivers update. As for the MSI one, most of the specs were great, the colors were described \"amazing\", but I saw some reviews complaining about pixel density, which I find pretty important since I spend most of my time coding.\n\nIf I have the option, I'll check out both of these monitors in person. I am open to other suggestions as well, within the pricing range **¬±**‚Ç¨50. Once I buy a monitor, I'll create a detailed guide on it as well. ",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone:\n\nI'm planning to build a multi-purpose desktop in the future and trying to determine an optimal monitor combination.\n\n**Resolution**: 1440P\n\n**Monitor Sizes**: 24 to 31.5 Inches\n\n**Non-Professional Uses**: Mostly gaming, mild video editing/content creation, casual AutoCAD, and general content consumption.\n\n**Professional Uses**: MS Excel/Office, financial modelling, data analysis, VBA and Python coding,\n\n**Possible Combinations**: 31.5+24, 31.5+27, 27+27, or single 31.5.\n\nAt home, I'm currently using a 15.6\" laptop. At work, I use a 24+24 setup with my work laptop. \n\nWhile I like the simplicity of a single monitor, I like the dual monitor setup better for multi-tasking. I'm leaning toward a 31.5 as the primary and having the 24 or 27 as the secondary for coding, file management, etc. For aesthetic purposes, I like the 27+27 for matching monitors.\n\nFor those of you that do the same things I plan to do, what monitor combinations do you find work better than others? Why?\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "**Hello community!**\n\nHere I am again, writing another review, with my music playing and my extra long black coffee nice and hot, and, although I already had all my ideas organized in my head, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to give another listen to the model I present today: **Kefine Delci AE**, released in 2024.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present **my sources:**\n\n\\-FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.  \n\\-FiiO KA13 while working.  \n\\-FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.  \n\\-FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.  \n\\-FiiO KA11.  \n\\-FiiO JA11.  \n\\-Macbook Air M4 3.5mm output.  \n\\-Shanling M0 Pro. **NEW!!**  \n\\-Amazon Music Ultimate.  \n\\-Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons:**\n\n\\-Pros  \n\\>The most comfortable set I‚Äôve ever tried.  \n\\>Works very well with any source.  \n\\>Very wide soundstage in all three axes.  \n\\>Solid, fun, precise sub-bass and bass.  \n\\>Clear, present, and layered mids.\n\n\\-Cons:  \n\\>Cable connections are not interchangeable.  \n\\>The gold filter makes the high frequencies aggressive.  \n\\>Treble a little compressed.  \n\\>The cable slider doesn‚Äôt stay fixed.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis set of monitors was provided by the brand **Kefine** and **Mr. Yang**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.\n\nThe price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65‚Ç¨**.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn‚Äôt have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.\n\nMy surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle‚Ä¶ but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.\n\n\n\n**Will they meet my tastes?**\n\nFirst, let‚Äôs look at the **package contents:**\n\n\\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  \n\\-User **manual**.  \n\\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  \n\\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  \n\\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  \n\\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  \n\\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.\n\n\n\n**They look comfortable, right?**\n\nThis is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.\n\nThe answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn‚Äôt have started better.\n\nThe capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone‚Äôs auricle and ear canal.\n\nFor this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.\n\nThe cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn‚Äôt tangle, and doesn‚Äôt pull by catching on your clothing.\n\nI don‚Äôt know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.\n\nWhat I didn‚Äôt find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn‚Äôt fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.\n\n\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n\\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  \n\\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  \n\\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  \n\\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz\n\nThe **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.\n\nI would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.\n\n\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nThese **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.\n\nMy experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.\n\nI could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone‚Äôs intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.\n\nHowever, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.\n\n*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn‚Äôt the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.\n\n*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn‚Äôt interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.\n\n*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.\n\n*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don‚Äôt feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.\n\n*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.\n\n*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don‚Äôt need more, nor do I want it.\n\n*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors‚Äô tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.\n\n*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.\n\n*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.\n\n**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.\n\nRegarding **layering**: I don‚Äôt know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can‚Äôt believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.\n\n\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.\n\nI encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\nThe source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.\n\nIn the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.\n\nIn *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.\n\nRegarding Kratos‚Äô very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.\n\nIn the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn‚Äôt the highest resolution experience I‚Äôve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.\n\nThe child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.\n\nContinuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it‚Äôs the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*\n\nWell, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.\n\nNevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn‚Äôt the best for purists since listening wasn‚Äôt fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.\n\n\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI don‚Äôt want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I‚Äôve tested. At least up to the **100‚Ç¨/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what‚Äôs the point of spending more money?\n\nI acknowledge it isn‚Äôt perfect. In fact, technically, it‚Äôs inferior to two other competitors in its price range I‚Äôve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I‚Äôm not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.\n\nThey have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn‚Äôt hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.\n\nMy sincerest congratulations to the brand.\n\nThank you for reading if you‚Äôve made it this far.\n\n**See you in the next review.**\n\n**Greetings!**",

    "title": "Myer Audio SLIIVO SL224 Earphones Review",
    "selftext": "I didn't expect much from Myer Audio, and I didn't really follow their work. The CKLVX D62 model is still popular, although it gets a lot more attention than it really deserves, I think; the SL41 MK2 one was excellent, but the next few models didn't seem to stand out in the stream of endless Chinese specialties.\n\nTherefore, I approached the next model, SLIIVO SL224, with minimum expectations. My loss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij95o9whopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2c35707a8bb0ad7bea5154dacf5740c96e62d49\n\nToday, we'll talk about SLIIVO SL224, in-ear headphones priced at $285 (as of October 2025).\n\n# All but the sound\n\nThe earphones are delivered in a cardboard box, normal-sized for the earphones of this price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46te32ckopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaf049b747a3e2612525251c1f342557f1e6e261\n\nIn the box, we can find the earphones themselves, a round leather case, 7 pairs of eartips, and a cable with replaceable connectors. No surprises.\n\nThe cable is beautiful, nice, with a resistance of 0.3 Ohms. The connectors are inserted and fixed to the cable with coarse-threaded nuts. This approach feels reliable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yq7y8nlopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e39369d65e608cae16450636cf618925bd366a2c\n\nIn addition to the 3.5 and 4.4 mm connectors, a Type-C connector was also included, which, of course, is not a connector at all, but a DAC. The DAC works exclusively in 16-bit/48 kHz mode, in Plug'n'play mode, with standard drivers in Windows 11, if nothing else. There are no special drivers on the [manufacturer's website](https://myeraudio.com/) (however, the website looks like it's being barely maintained, to put it mildly). The Walk Play app doesn't see it. But thanks for including it anyway.\n\nThere are 3 pairs of slightly tighter silicone eartips of a standard shape, sizes S, M and L...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xtkizhnopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1d969d57be38137156ba8de6bb85674f71f3ff\n\n...3 more pairs of slightly softer silicone eartips...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w63t0snoopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20fc14caa0167803e16403be6c068333bf719521\n\n...as well as 1 pair of foam ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy6v1cxpopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cca6a13136ec2ef430ce9374cb05ea4469a0a812\n\nThe earphones themselves are technically made on the basis of a menagerie of 2 dynamic (6 and 10 mm), 2 armature and 4 microplanar drivers, or a total of 8 drivers in each earphone. Each of the driver types plays back lower, middle, and upper frequencies, respectively.\n\nThe earphones' enclosures are made of polymer resin and have a pronounced relief, that is, ergonomic depressions and projections.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfydif6ropxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0e22a05e4a02671e7249bbe0040085de8fcb5d1\n\nThe earphones are designed for an average depth of the fit and have standard diameters of sound ducts by modern standards, so you can experiment with eartips at great length and with abandon: SpinFit CP100+, Pentaconn COREIR, Roseselsa SoundCocoon, Divinus Prism Wide Bore ‚Äì [they all](https://boizoff.com/eartips_part_4/) fit and let you comfortably place the earphones in your ears. I never managed to settle on anything specific, as they all are fine.\n\nI can't say anything bad about SL224 in terms of user experience and ergonomics ‚Äì they're just well-made modern in-ear headphones without any pitfalls. Of course, their black polished plastic surface scratches quickly and collects fingerprints, but that's how 99% of all headphones are made now, so there's nothing we can do. I can also complain about the case: for the earphones of this size and the cable of this length and thickness, this case is frankly small. Give me a bigger one now!\n\nAs for the electrical characteristics, the manufacturer claims a resistance of 36 Œ© and a sensitivity of 108 dB. I can't comment on the second value, but I've recently become able to measure resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vktmk7topxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0087afee237e878d735e0bae6214e181dd579035\n\nIt varies from 34 to 14 Œ©.\n\n# The sound\n\n*Standard links:*\n\n1. *the description of my rig is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/renovation-of-my-measuring-rig-for-headphones/)*;*\n2. *the audiogram of my hearing is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/audiogram/)*;*\n3. *articles on measurement theory and the whole shebang are* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/category/audiophile/theory/)*.*\n\nFrequency response of SLIIVO SL224 earphones with original foam eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hfl2191ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cea47660d534a586276350a062dc957e1a569d4\n\nAnd, before analyzing the frequency response, let me remind you that this frequency response will strongly depend on the depth of the fit. Frequency response of SL224 for the second resonance at 7000, 7500, 8000 and 8500 Hz:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lbyhjm2ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb404456030ce4a4c3f442905acc9d1c7a41284\n\nNote that there is no simple displacement of the resonant peak. On the contrary, the entire range from 3 to 20 kHz changes significantly, and only the emphasis at 12 kHz remains more or less stable in terms of volume and 'width', so to speak. The key thing that can be seen from these graphs is that the deeper the earphones are placed in the auditory canals, the lower the area before the second resonance 'droops' and the higher the peak rises around 15 kHz.\n\nComparison of frequency response for original foam and silicone eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg8uwbu4ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c2be14aaa3c3c99ba0cf535c6d00c6b7b3175bc\n\nAnyway, we can see the following on the graphs:\n\n* it seems to be a more or less typical sound delivery a la Harman;\n* but with reduced subbass;\n* and with a 'muffled', but rather 'smooth' 4-10 kHz segment;\n* as well as with an expansion after 10 kHz, the nature of which depends on the eartips. The graph obtained when using silicone eartips is more valid for my ears.\n\nBesides, consider a slight rise in the bass, about 250 Hz, as well as the shape of the 600 Hz to 3 kHz segment ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost linear. We'll talk below how this affects the SL224 sound perception.\n\nNonlinear distortion at 94 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g2c9x48ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=031fd6a69ca193c02a48b3996e51ed689a3e213e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrc4ao19ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3afce27b77c8e94f80bfa77f522bdc0e82f1eec\n\nNonlinear distortion at 104 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_1.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_1.jpg)\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_2.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_2.jpg)\n\nThere's not much to comment on here: at 94 dB, the distortion is just over 0.5% at the maximum; at 104 dB volume, it's over 1%. That is, they have no audible effect on the sound.\n\nMinimum phase response, group delay, and spectrogram in the 'Burst decay' mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kxxdhfdppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbabddd9448e7feaa7bfba5bd9e255749fba11db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfq42o6eppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=258891b29d856b4a4102a1ee88176893e93ffc2b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jadpkhseppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e62b9f7e963ddeb411d1c3629b85179cc9f17a3\n\nIt's a common near-ideal pattern, typical for all modern in-ears of a similar price.\n\nMy subjective evaluation is that I'm blown away primarily by how full-fledged the SL224 sound delivery turned out to be. And I deliberately don't use the word 'balanced' because it refers to the concept of neutrality. Literally everything in the sound of these earphones is in place. All frequencies are exactly in the amount that my ear personally expects. There is a very, very weighty, but technical subbass, a 'close' articulated middle with a hearing-friendly range at about 6-8 kHz, and an airy lightness after 10 kHz. It's very difficult to describe this sound because it's 'correct' and 'tasty' at the same time. In other words, you definitely won't be able to complain about tonal inaccuracy as it's at a very high level, but you also have this feeling of a 'spectacular' sound. It's difficult for me to clearly connect this with measurement graphs, but I assume that it's the linear range of 600-3000 Hz (and here we can move on to an endless debate about how to correctly combine frequency response graphs for comparison), as well as some emphasis on ultra-high frequencies that speak for themselves.\n\nA standalone interesting quality of these earphones, which I really appreciate and which is relatively rare, is the instrument sound separation. It's just splendid. You can listen to each vocal line, percussion, each component of the track separately and distinguish its perception from the overall musical flow.\n\nMoreover, the width of the sound stage is clearly larger than average. SL224 play in a large-scale, airy manner, and the recording space noticeably lives and breathes. The music plays 'around your head' and even more or less from behind rather than between your ears.\n\nAs one would expect with such sound delivery, these earphones are very versatile in terms of suitable musical content. The only limitation, apart from your taste, is the quality of tracks. If a sound engineer has been careful about recording and processing of the high frequency area, everything will be fine. If they haven't, you will be hearing weird and unpleasant things.\n\n# Comparisons\n\nIf we compare within the price category, guided by the [best online rating of in-ear monitors](https://boizoff.com/language/en/the-best-iems/), then the following models will be next to SL224:\n\n* PULA ANVIL 114\n* Letshuoer Cadenza 4\n* Kiwi Ears Orchestra Lite.\n\nI have compared them, of course, up-close and personal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1p7xn3ippxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0934c4bb516dc35126dc0ced23e9d82aefefd3ec\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to ANVIL 114: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_ANVIL114.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_ANVIL114.png)\n\nWhen A/B-ing, ANVIL 114 fully justify their name, hitting the listener's ears with a steel hammer: this is a massive, 'fat' sound supported by a bone conduction driver against the rather neutral, 'elegant' SL224 sound delivery.\n\n\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Cadenza 4: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Cadenza\\_4.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Cadenza_4.png)\n\nCadenza 4 are an example of excellent 'light' headphones. Compared to SL224, they have more 'top' and less 'bottom' in almost identical proportions. The Cadenza 4's sound delivery is 'airier', lighter, 'sparklier', and they have a slightly smoother section after 10 kHz, while SL224, again, are more neutral and, therefore, more versatile in comparison.\n\n\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Orchestra Lite: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Orchestra\\_Lite.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Orchestra_Lite.png)\n\nWe love Orchestra Lite for their infinitely expressive 'middle'. It seems that Orchestra Lite deliver sound even 'closer' to the listener, and they're a little brighter if we evaluate the sound delivery by and large, but SL224 win in terms of reliability and 'punch'.\n\n\n\nIf we look at the SL224 tuning conceptually, so to speak, then we need to compare them with completely different earphones ‚Äì [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/) and [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o78vvvipppxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ca90c5ee84b8406929c106d0d5555ef26ddc5b\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Meteor: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Meteor.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Meteor.png)\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Mega5-EST: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Mega5-EST.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Mega5-EST.png)\n\nAll three graphs compared:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mna3exppxf1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65aac9b4a17b9c969bac7fa6de31bcb38d5dc526\n\nCompared to Meteor, SL224 have a weightier bass and subbass due to a less pronounced middle; the Meteor sound seems sterile and faded against SL224. And, compared to Mega5-EST SL224, on the contrary, they're slightly less bassy, and the midrange is more pronounced. By ear, the SL224's sound delivery is almost perfectly equidistant from the tunings of these two models. The only thing that SL224 don't have is a smooth (by ear) frequency response after 10 kHz, which competitors can boast of. SL224 deliver this segment clearer, but less accurate. But prices vary accordingly, too.\n\nThe only aspect where I can name the best option for less money is gaming: from a positioning point of view, [KBEAR Cepheus](https://boizoff.com/language/en/kbear-cepheus-earphones-review/) remain unattainable and subjectively the best headphones for competitive games. But SL224 are also quite good in this context, don't get me wrong.\n\n# Summary\n\nI believe that the SL224's entry into the market is a significant milestone in the modern headphone industry. The SL224 is as iconic a model as [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/), [EPZ K9](https://boizoff.com/language/en/epz-k9-earphones-review/) or [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/) in their categories.\n\nAs for the sound‚Ä¶ I'm willing to pay to see the first reaction to the SL224 sound of someone for whom these earphones will be the first or second under the sun, as the wow effect from their first listening is so intense, and they differ so much from 'just headphones' and any TWS. SL224 are tuned just superbly: their sound delivery is simultaneously engaging, especially if you turn up the volume, but also reliable and large-scale in the sense of a virtual sound stage.\n\nWho won't like them? 'Bassheads' and fans of listening to music in the conditions of high ambient noise, that is, on the streets of a big city (noise masking will reduce the sound of these headphones to medium and high frequencies only).\n\nTo buy or not to buy? To buy!  \n",

    "selftext": "So, in the \"I'm Exploring the World\" column, I decided to listen to something other than electrostatic there must be other headphones out there, right?\n\nI thought I should try a TOTL of dynamic and planar headphones.\n\nSo, I found the\n\n* Sennheiser HD800/HD800S\n* and Focal Utopia 2022\n* and Hifiman Susvara OG\n\nLet's start with the Hifiman Susvara. Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones. I'd certainly like to hear the top-end Sony R10s or something like the Spirit Torino Valkyria and there are plenty of planar headphones out there..",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I am having some problems with the sound on my Aune AR5000, and would like some advice.\n\nA lot of people say that the sound on the Aune AR5000 is great and they typically don't mention any problems with it. However, I am experiencing some extremely harsh, sharp and painful kind of sibilance to some vocals on some tracks. For example from 1:43-1:55 on Duckworth by Kendrick Lamar. This happens mostly on s-sounds.\n\nI found that I had to meticulously EQ around 9800 Hz (q factor of 3), reducing it by around 6-7 dB in order to get rid of this painful sound. However, I find that doing this makes the overall sound more dull, dark and less defined. I'm not sure what to do. Measurement of the AR5000's frequency response shows a big peak at around 9500 Hz, could this perhaps be why? I did not see Resolve mention this problem in his review of the headphones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/undw3zt1kpxf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c527c80ede8fe7708253b26ec1c84e2adf4e1f8\n\nI have a pair of airpods pro 2 that i have no problems with. No painful sharp vocals.\n\nIs this a common problem among people? And is having to perform such a big EQ change even acceptable?  \nAm i experiencing this because I have a weird HRTF?  \nPerhaps any owners of the AR5000 that can give their thoughts and experience with this?",

    "title": "In the market: DCA Noire XO or E3?",
    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI know the question is odd since it's a open vs closed back DCA, however I am in the market for a new set. For my listening tastes, my 6XX doesn't cut it. I then got a planar FT1 Pro and the widened soundstage is nice, but I hate certain aspects of the headphones (including the stock pads and putting on some Dekoni LCD-type pads certainly changed the headphones too much) and I find it really sounds bad when I drive them with EQ that brings it closer to Harman. The dips I can hear in 2K-5K is very annoying to try and EQ properly and I haven't been able to make it right with the new pads; they're either distant or very grating.\n\nConversly, I noticed that once I tuned my 6XX's close to Harman using ortary's EQ, I vastly enjoyed the sound more, but the technical aspects of the 6XX's were starting to bug me, like the lack of Impact of bass and the narrow soundstage,\n\nHence my look into DCA's more Harman tuned headphones. I have heard very good things about E3, namely that it has a vast sound-stage for a closed back, large drivers/earcups (I do have a big fuggin head), etc. etc. However, now that I see that the Noire XO is out for several hundred less, I am also looking at these, namely on DMS' recommendation and his bit about \"if you LPF after 10k, you effectively get E3\". Pair the Noire XO's promising looking bass response, I am at a bit of a decision paralysis between the two for an end-game desktop setup.\n\nSo, for people that have listened to one or the other, is the E3 worth it for the extra money vs the Noire XO in your own personal opinion? What about for someone like myself that wants a more Harman tuned, wider soundstage headphone? It's one thing to say \"has a wide soundstage for a closed back\", but then how does it compare to an actual open back in the Noire XO?\n\nThanks! :)\n\ne; I also don't live anywhere near a place to test each.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

The headband started peeling off not that long ago and then it started to quickly deteriorate after that. I stopped using the Virtuoso and started using my Raycons instead, then I got my Nothing Ear. They have been ok, but at the same time, the Virtuoso is there in a corner, forgotten and neglected, but it is an amazing headset and I'd really like to get back to using it.\n\n  \nThey still work!

These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite.

I just like music and love a good deal.\n\nThe Edifier WH950NB likely need no introduction; they launched for ‚Ç¨150 in Europe two years ago, have been around ‚Ç¨110 for a long time, and the white model has dipped to ‚Ç¨71 for a week a few months ago. I bought them on launch, and waited for a long time to form my opinion.\n\nI commute a few hours with them daily, and charge them once a week. I'm coming from a Hifiman Deva Pro, Sennheiser HD58X, and HD560S. I cannot overstate it: these headphones are phenomenal. Not \"good enough for Bluetooth headphones\", no, I often use them as my preferred listening experience over the others.\n\nHere's the secret: you get a (somewhat restricted) parametric EQ in the Edifier app. However, I created a preset from data (and my ears) that sounds so, so much better than the default tuning (see attached image for graphs):\n\n39Hz -3dB 2.0 (Optional)\n\n3000Hz -8dB 2.0\n\n3300Hz 3dB 2.0\n\n9000Hz 3dB 0.5\n\nIf you use UAPP on Android you can do automatic sample rate switching so you bypass Android's resampler on LDAC, and with some extra parametric EQ bands in UAPP you can improve the sound signature slightly more (I can add my preset in a comment if anyone is interested).\n\nOther than sound signature, these do everything you'd expect from a modern pair of BT headphones. There's passive and active 3.5mm support, a massive two-week battery, multiple ANC modes, multi-point Bluetooth 5.3, 96/32 LDAC, safe volume limiter, low latency mode, theater surround sound mode, and most importantly, an amazing travel case with a bunch of accessoires included (airplane splitter, usb-c cable, 3.5mm L-shape cable, protection pad for the folded cup).\n\nGenuinely wondering how no one is talking about these. Some of my family members, friends and colleagues bought one on my recommendation and they all think it's an amazing product. I only hear about the ‚Ç¨300+ products from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser etc.\n\nIs there anyone else that has these?\n\nEdit: Formatting",

    "selftext": "Here's a trimmed down version of my full review over on head-fi. You can find it [here](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/aune-n7.28592/reviews).\n\n# Aune N7 Review ‚Äî Mojo 2 Finds Its Match\n\nAfter upgrading to the Hifiman Arya Stealth, I wanted a proper Class A amp to bring out their full potential. I‚Äôve long used the Chord Mojo 2 as my main DAC/amp ‚Äî a brilliant device ‚Äî but I suspected pairing it with a pure Class A amp might unlock something new. Enter the **Aune N7**.\n\n# Build & Design\n\nCompact, solid, and purposeful ‚Äî the **N7**‚Äôs machined aluminum chassis with side heat fins looks serious and feels premium. The **volume knob** clicks smoothly but can skip if turned too fast. The **aluminum remote** feels fantastic, though its **volume buttons** could be better placed.  \nThe **display** is functional but small; no brightness control. As expected from a Class A amp, it runs warm ‚Äî hand-warmer warm, not egg-frying hot. The internal temperature stays around 45¬∞C even after long sessions.\n\n# Listening Setup\n\n**Chain:** Spotify Lossless ‚Üí WiiM Mini ‚Üí Mojo 2 ‚Üí Aune N7 ‚Üí Hifiman Arya Stealth (balanced out, high gain/high current).\n\n# Sound Impressions\n\n* **Steely Dan ‚Äì ‚ÄúAja‚Äù**: The N7 adds depth and weight, expanding the soundstage front-to-back. Bass gains texture; cymbals smooth out; the sax solo feels more alive. Some upper-mid sparkle is softened, but the trade-off is cohesion.\n* **Bill Evans Trio ‚Äì ‚ÄúSunday at the Village Vanguard‚Äù**: The sense of space and realism jumps. You don‚Äôt just hear LaFaro‚Äôs bass ‚Äî you feel it resonate. Evans‚Äô piano takes on body and warmth, and brushwork on the snare is wonderfully tactile.\n* **Snarky Puppy ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe Like It Here‚Äù**: A perfect showcase for the N7‚Äôs Class A dynamics. Everything stays tight and layered even in dense sections. You lose a touch of bite on transients, but gain richness and flow.\n* **Martha Argerich ‚Äì Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3**: The Mojo alone is precise but dry. Add the N7 and the sound breathes ‚Äî the piano has weight and the hall ambience comes alive.\n* **Entheogenic ‚Äì ‚ÄúDreamtime Physics‚Äù**: Electronica gains dimension and slam. Sub-bass digs deeper, highs shimmer smoothly, and the sound feels enveloping. The N7‚Äôs black background lets microdetails emerge effortlessly.\n\n# Tonal Character\n\nThe **N7** sits between **neutral and warm**, adding body without syrup. It turns the Mojo 2‚Äôs clinical precision into a more natural, organic presentation ‚Äî like switching from a microscope to a beautifully developed photo. Mids are dense, bass tight, highs extended yet smooth.\n\n# Noise & Power\n\nAbsolutely silent, even at high gain. The Arya Stealth reaches satisfying levels around 10‚Äì15/30 volume steps, leaving plenty of headroom. Rated at **6.5W @ 32Œ© balanced**, the N7 drives demanding planars effortlessly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe **Aune N7** is a **$399 Class A gem** ‚Äî compact, powerful, and genuinely musical. It transforms the Mojo 2 from analytical to alive, and makes the Arya Stealth sound more organic and fatigue-free.  \nIf you want long, engaging sessions and real Class A smoothness without spending big or cluttering your desk, this is the one. Mine‚Äôs staying put ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the best endorsement I can give.",

HE1000 Stealth (does not require EQ): still the best allrounder\n2. HE6se V2: very natural and smooth, great 3D sound with slightly less stage size than Arya Sealth, more weight and slam, excellent midrange, amazing separation\n3. Arya Stealth: fuller and richer but less emphasis than HE6 in many ways, slightly more balanced and smoother, good overall sound for a number of different use cases\n\nBoth the HE6se V2 (EQ'd) and HE1000 Stealth trade blows. It's definitely no slouch and ever so slightly prefer it over the HE1000 Stealth with certain genres such as rock and metal. For everything else including classical music, and videogame/movie OST's such as LOTR, Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 etc. the HE1000 Stealth is the overall winner, including Rap and Hip-Hop.\n\nThe most noticeable factors of the HE1000 Stealth over the Arya Stealth is note weight and staging. Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be ¬£3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

However, I do listen to lots of metal, and in some tracks, especially more chaotic with lots going on or just old and badly mixed - Aryas get a little bit harsh. Equalizer works great but it also kinda kills the beautiful detail on other songs, so it feels like a compromise. I can get used to switching equalizer settings but I can also afford another pair of headphones, that would be used for more casual listening or metal in general. \n\nBudget is flexible if it's worth it. I've been thinking about HD490Pro or HD660S2 (listened to both in a shop nearby, sounded nice and relaxed, but plastic build felt a bit cheap), maybe audeze LCD-2c (didn't get to listen to). It has to be different to be worth it, probably warmer, more forgiving, less harsh, but still a good hi-fi headphones. Any opinions are welcome!",

    "selftext": "That's what I want to know. Regardless of what experts, reviews or anyone what is saying: what is your perfect pair of headphones? \n\nI used to have a pair of first generation Sennheiser Momentum but then due to working from home and getting a Jabra Evolve 75 SE from my company for calls I stopped using them and somehow lost them. \n\nRecently there came a point, though, where I got sick and tired from listening to music on them. I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring. At that moment I realised that they are perfect for me.",

    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it‚Äôs tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For ‚Äúheavier‚Äù music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that‚Äôs clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It‚Äôs an excellent headphone and if you don‚Äôt AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

    "title": "CCA CRA+: pure fun at a ridiculous price.",
    "selftext": "Hello Community!\n\nThis time it's the review of a low-cost product, but just because it costs little money doesn't mean we should forget about this range. In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO JA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**‚Ç¨13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 ‚Ç¨/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of ‚Ç¨30 than one of ‚Ç¨100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶let's start with the **package content:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† User manual\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the ‚Ç¨13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but‚Ä¶ the highs got easily out of control‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶ I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is‚Ä¶ somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child‚Äôs voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors‚Äô behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies‚Äô guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **‚Ç¨13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n¬†",

I‚Äôm About to make a job change to wfh and decided last week I‚Äôd get myself a Christmas present of noise cancellation, over the ear headphone to reduce those outside distractions while I‚Äôm trying to concentrate and focus. \n\n4 or 7 years or so ago the wife and I were goofing in a mall and visiting a crowded Apple Store for some reason. We live in a rural area and it‚Äôs two hours to the nearest so it‚Äôs a novel event and we wandered around checking out everything . Outside of some Bose about 15+ years ago, I‚Äôve never had occasion to be near NC Headphones. \n\nAnyway, I popped these on and EVERYTHING went dead silent. Best of all, my wife‚Äôs voice, right in front of my face trying to talk to me. Reminded me of that scene in, I think, Face Off with travolta and cage where someone drops headphones of soothing music on the little 4 yr old kid and then a huge gun battle breaks out. In that crazy, crowded, noisy store I heard nothing but soft cool jazz. I could see my wife‚Äôs lips moving but could hear a word and it was pure bliss. Not sure which model I had but they were like $500+ at the time. \n\nQ: Anything BETTER, or cheaper yet still super isolating and effective these days? How would I go about trying other models out? \n\nAlso appreciate advice on replacing ear pads, battery life, overall longevity of devices. ",

Especially the high-quality bass. But one thing that made me really happy as a customer is the accessories you get. When I bought much more expensive headphones, they don't treat you as good as FiiO. You get the regular 3.5mm cable with 6.35mm adapter but also a premium looking case and A BALANCED 4.4MM CABLE! Amazing headphones with amazing accessories. all for an amazing price. It's super convenient because I always wanted a balanced cable for my HD 600 and Edition XS but they are quite expensive. The fact that FiiO included them is just really nice. Now I can use them for my Edition XS without having to go out and look and spend money on them.\n\nThis really reminds me of how cheap smartphones gives you more than $1000 smartphones. You get a screen protector already applied, a free phone case included in the box and of course a should-be-mandatory charging brick. But for $1000 you don't even get a charger, like how is a dude gonna charge the damn phone???",

However, when running the tone generator on squig.link I notice there is a tone within the tone at various frequencies. Not sure what that's about.\n\n300hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n1700hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n4000hz - left channel there are two seperate freqs coming through\n\n4900hz - right channel tone issue\n\nWould I have ever noticed just listening to music and watching videos?

Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better.

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630, Bowers & Wilkins PX8 S2, and PX7 S3 shootout",
    "selftext": "**source:** tidal or personal flac files through bluetooth aptx\n\n**FIT:**\n\nHDB 630 - very comfortable but loosest of the bunch. felt a bit insecure. if l looked up or shook my head I had that feeling they may fall off. smaller ear cups too if you're concern about that and I could feel contact with my ears but nothing uncomfortable for me.\n\nPX7 S3 - slightly more clamping force which got a little uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. best seal out of the bunch so pick your poison.\n\nPx8 S2 - most comfortable. not too tight, not too loose. just right on my head. doesn't feel insecure.\n\n**BUILD QUALITY:**\n\nHDB 630 - decent. I would expect more at this price. honestly feels a bit plasticky and cheap. style also is very bland. doesn't look premium. Also, I personally don't like the swipe touch controls and I found them finicky.\n\nPX7 S3 - excellent. no leather. great styling and premium look. I enjoy the button controls better than the Sennheiser.\n\nPx8 S2 - excellent. has leather if you're concern about that. great styling and premium look even more than the px7. same button controls as the px7.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nHDB 630 - good but not great. with airplane noise it's about the same as the Px7. 630's were better with distinct noises like voices or background noise in a cafe or on a bus.\n\nPX7 S3 - good. not great. pretty good with airplane noise but distinct noises leak through quite a bit.\n\nPx8 S2 - just okay. worst of the bunch surprisingly. let in more airplane noise than the other two and distinct sounds leaked through quite a bit like the Px7\n\n**SQ:**\n\n**HDB 630:**\n\ntuning: pretty neutral\n\nspace and technicalities: space and staging is good. not great but all three are closed back so that's a natural limitation. Sennheiser is more relaxed and less \"fun\" but some audiophiles prefer that. both the Px7 and Px8 everything sounds closer and more \"fun\". good technicalities though. everything feels snappy and controlled. instrument separation is great.\n\nbass: well extended into sub bass and well controlled but is definitely not the star of the show. a bit thin sounding if you're not used to audiophile tuning. they can rumble though if you boost the bass with the EQ\n\nmids: maybe it's the audiophile tuning but it sounds a bit shouty to me. definitely not warm. lower mids seems thin while upper mids sound too forward. vocals sound a bit thin and snares sound a little sharp. actually a bit annoying to my ears but I tend to be treble sensitive.\n\ntreble: great as you would suspect from audiophile tuning. well extended and controlled but do weirdly get harsh for me. again, I'm a bit sensitive to treble so YMMV with that.\n\n**PX7 S3:**\n\ntuning: very bloated bass. maybe you'll like it if you're a basshead. good extension into sub bass but a bit less controlled than the px8 and 630 but still pretty good.\n\nspace and technicalities: worst of the bunch but still pretty good and pleasant to the ears. I only really notice they're worse after listening to the other headphones. both the px8 and 630 extract more detail and sound more spacious and 3D.\n\nbass: way bloated. strong and good extension into sub bass\n\nmids: my favorite here actually. sounds intimate and full. smooth and fun tuning. not shouty.\n\ntreble: my favorite also. sounds well extended and airy but not overly so. doesn't get sharp or shouty. maybe a tad rolled off and recessed compared to true audiophile tuning but to my ear they are close to just right. very pleasant sounding. the treble adds a bit of nice air and sparkle without getting annoying.\n\n**Px8 S2:**\n\ntuning: I would still consider these bass bloated but less so than the px7. mids feel a tiny bit more recessed than the px7 but more present and forward than the 630. more treble presence than the px7. maybe about the same as the 630 but sounds less shouty.\n\nspace and technicalities: very good here. better 3D space and detail than the px7. bass is tighter and transients feels slightly snappier than the px7. similar to the 630 in terms of space and detail but again, the B&Ws feel closer and more \"fun\".\n\nbass: my favorite bass of the three. still sounds bloated to me but less so than the px7. more balanced and controlled than the px7. definitely way more power here than the 630 without EQing.\n\nmids: very good. tiny bit recessed compared to the px7. sounds smooth and balanced.\n\ntreble: very good here. well controlled and extended but still sounds smooth. about the same presence as the 630 but sounds more balanced to me.\n\n**what I'm keeping?**\n\nto my surprise, I think I'm keeping the Px7 S3. I'm hoping the band loosens a bit. the ANC is pretty good especially with airplane noise. the B&W styling is very attractive. mids and highs are great and tuned to my liking. sense of space and technicalities are still very good and pleasant to listen to. and for now, I have the low bass down 3.5 and mid bass down 2.0 and they sound less bloated.",

    "title": "3 year Review of the Audeze LCD-X (Post 2021 Version)",
    "selftext": "To start off, these are such incredible cans. It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

While I think the ATs beat them in imaging, it isn‚Äôt that big of a difference. They are less comfortable, don‚Äôt have any bass, build quality feels cheap. \n\nI tried them with BF6 and while it was immersive, the moment I put on the 490s after these the difference was apparent. The velour pads work well with my glasses and are way more comfortable than the audio technicas. \n\nI also tried listening to some music, namely BRAT because I love the production on that album and these lacked any sort of punch. I have SONY MDR MV1s coming in tomorrow, will see how they hold up against what I already have. Looking for something more V shaped and lush compared to the 560s sound signature and I‚Äôve heard that the mv1s fit that description well. If they don‚Äôt I might return the 490s, R70xas and MV1s and skipping mid fi completely and move to some Hi Fi offerings like Clears/Meze 109 pro/FT7 (because I want to try planars). Any other suggestions are welcome, looking for open backs with a big soundstage as well as a bass boost. Not too concerned with neutrality. ",

After days of generic emails, they offered a 25% discount on another purchase. Why would I buy a faulty product again?

The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else. I would be perfectly happy with these as my open back and Aeon Closed RT as my closed back for the forseeable future.",

    "selftext": "So, in the \"I'm Exploring the World\" column, I decided to listen to something other than electrostatic there must be other headphones out there, right?\n\nI thought I should try a TOTL of dynamic and planar headphones.\n\nSo, I found the\n\n* Sennheiser HD800/HD800S\n* and Focal Utopia 2022\n* and Hifiman Susvara OG\n\nLet's start with the Hifiman Susvara. Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones. I'd certainly like to hear the top-end Sony R10s or something like the Spirit Torino Valkyria and there are plenty of planar headphones out there..",

    "title": "Aune N7 Class A Headphone Amp - Stunning Power and Value",
    "selftext": "Here's a trimmed down version of my full review over on head-fi. You can find it [here](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/aune-n7.28592/reviews).\n\n# Aune N7 Review ‚Äî Mojo 2 Finds Its Match\n\nAfter upgrading to the Hifiman Arya Stealth, I wanted a proper Class A amp to bring out their full potential. I‚Äôve long used the Chord Mojo 2 as my main DAC/amp ‚Äî a brilliant device ‚Äî but I suspected pairing it with a pure Class A amp might unlock something new. Enter the **Aune N7**.\n\n# Build & Design\n\nCompact, solid, and purposeful ‚Äî the **N7**‚Äôs machined aluminum chassis with side heat fins looks serious and feels premium. The **volume knob** clicks smoothly but can skip if turned too fast. The **aluminum remote** feels fantastic, though its **volume buttons** could be better placed.  \nThe **display** is functional but small; no brightness control. As expected from a Class A amp, it runs warm ‚Äî hand-warmer warm, not egg-frying hot. The internal temperature stays around 45¬∞C even after long sessions.\n\n# Listening Setup\n\n**Chain:** Spotify Lossless ‚Üí WiiM Mini ‚Üí Mojo 2 ‚Üí Aune N7 ‚Üí Hifiman Arya Stealth (balanced out, high gain/high current).\n\n# Sound Impressions\n\n* **Steely Dan ‚Äì ‚ÄúAja‚Äù**: The N7 adds depth and weight, expanding the soundstage front-to-back. Bass gains texture; cymbals smooth out; the sax solo feels more alive. Some upper-mid sparkle is softened, but the trade-off is cohesion.\n* **Bill Evans Trio ‚Äì ‚ÄúSunday at the Village Vanguard‚Äù**: The sense of space and realism jumps. You don‚Äôt just hear LaFaro‚Äôs bass ‚Äî you feel it resonate. Evans‚Äô piano takes on body and warmth, and brushwork on the snare is wonderfully tactile.\n* **Snarky Puppy ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe Like It Here‚Äù**: A perfect showcase for the N7‚Äôs Class A dynamics. Everything stays tight and layered even in dense sections. You lose a touch of bite on transients, but gain richness and flow.\n* **Martha Argerich ‚Äì Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3**: The Mojo alone is precise but dry. Add the N7 and the sound breathes ‚Äî the piano has weight and the hall ambience comes alive.\n* **Entheogenic ‚Äì ‚ÄúDreamtime Physics‚Äù**: Electronica gains dimension and slam. Sub-bass digs deeper, highs shimmer smoothly, and the sound feels enveloping. The N7‚Äôs black background lets microdetails emerge effortlessly.\n\n# Tonal Character\n\nThe **N7** sits between **neutral and warm**, adding body without syrup. It turns the Mojo 2‚Äôs clinical precision into a more natural, organic presentation ‚Äî like switching from a microscope to a beautifully developed photo. Mids are dense, bass tight, highs extended yet smooth.\n\n# Noise & Power\n\nAbsolutely silent, even at high gain. The Arya Stealth reaches satisfying levels around 10‚Äì15/30 volume steps, leaving plenty of headroom. Rated at **6.5W @ 32Œ© balanced**, the N7 drives demanding planars effortlessly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe **Aune N7** is a **$399 Class A gem** ‚Äî compact, powerful, and genuinely musical. It transforms the Mojo 2 from analytical to alive, and makes the Arya Stealth sound more organic and fatigue-free.  \nIf you want long, engaging sessions and real Class A smoothness without spending big or cluttering your desk, this is the one. Mine‚Äôs staying put ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the best endorsement I can give.",

    "title": "In the market: DCA Noire XO or E3?",
    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI know the question is odd since it's a open vs closed back DCA, however I am in the market for a new set. For my listening tastes, my 6XX doesn't cut it. I then got a planar FT1 Pro and the widened soundstage is nice, but I hate certain aspects of the headphones (including the stock pads and putting on some Dekoni LCD-type pads certainly changed the headphones too much) and I find it really sounds bad when I drive them with EQ that brings it closer to Harman. The dips I can hear in 2K-5K is very annoying to try and EQ properly and I haven't been able to make it right with the new pads; they're either distant or very grating.\n\nConversly, I noticed that once I tuned my 6XX's close to Harman using ortary's EQ, I vastly enjoyed the sound more, but the technical aspects of the 6XX's were starting to bug me, like the lack of Impact of bass and the narrow soundstage,\n\nHence my look into DCA's more Harman tuned headphones. I have heard very good things about E3, namely that it has a vast sound-stage for a closed back, large drivers/earcups (I do have a big fuggin head), etc. etc. However, now that I see that the Noire XO is out for several hundred less, I am also looking at these, namely on DMS' recommendation and his bit about \"if you LPF after 10k, you effectively get E3\". Pair the Noire XO's promising looking bass response, I am at a bit of a decision paralysis between the two for an end-game desktop setup.\n\nSo, for people that have listened to one or the other, is the E3 worth it for the extra money vs the Noire XO in your own personal opinion? What about for someone like myself that wants a more Harman tuned, wider soundstage headphone? It's one thing to say \"has a wide soundstage for a closed back\", but then how does it compare to an actual open back in the Noire XO?\n\nThanks! :)\n\ne; I also don't live anywhere near a place to test each.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

    "selftext": "**Hello community!**\n\nHere I am again, writing another review, with my music playing and my extra long black coffee nice and hot, and, although I already had all my ideas organized in my head, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to give another listen to the model I present today: **Kefine Delci AE**, released in 2024.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present **my sources:**\n\n\\-FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.  \n\\-FiiO KA13 while working.  \n\\-FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.  \n\\-FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.  \n\\-FiiO KA11.  \n\\-FiiO JA11.  \n\\-Macbook Air M4 3.5mm output.  \n\\-Shanling M0 Pro. **NEW!!**  \n\\-Amazon Music Ultimate.  \n\\-Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons:**\n\n\\-Pros  \n\\>The most comfortable set I‚Äôve ever tried.  \n\\>Works very well with any source.  \n\\>Very wide soundstage in all three axes.  \n\\>Solid, fun, precise sub-bass and bass.  \n\\>Clear, present, and layered mids.\n\n\\-Cons:  \n\\>Cable connections are not interchangeable.  \n\\>The gold filter makes the high frequencies aggressive.  \n\\>Treble a little compressed.  \n\\>The cable slider doesn‚Äôt stay fixed.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis set of monitors was provided by the brand **Kefine** and **Mr. Yang**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.\n\nThe price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65‚Ç¨**.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn‚Äôt have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.\n\nMy surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle‚Ä¶ but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.\n\n\n\n**Will they meet my tastes?**\n\nFirst, let‚Äôs look at the **package contents:**\n\n\\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  \n\\-User **manual**.  \n\\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  \n\\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  \n\\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  \n\\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  \n\\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.\n\n\n\n**They look comfortable, right?**\n\nThis is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.\n\nThe answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn‚Äôt have started better.\n\nThe capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone‚Äôs auricle and ear canal.\n\nFor this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.\n\nThe cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn‚Äôt tangle, and doesn‚Äôt pull by catching on your clothing.\n\nI don‚Äôt know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.\n\nWhat I didn‚Äôt find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn‚Äôt fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.\n\n\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n\\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  \n\\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  \n\\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  \n\\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz\n\nThe **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.\n\nI would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.\n\n\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nThese **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.\n\nMy experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.\n\nI could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone‚Äôs intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.\n\nHowever, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.\n\n*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn‚Äôt the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.\n\n*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn‚Äôt interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.\n\n*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.\n\n*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don‚Äôt feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.\n\n*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.\n\n*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don‚Äôt need more, nor do I want it.\n\n*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors‚Äô tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.\n\n*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.\n\n*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.\n\n**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.\n\nRegarding **layering**: I don‚Äôt know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can‚Äôt believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.\n\n\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.\n\nI encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\nThe source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.\n\nIn the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.\n\nIn *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.\n\nRegarding Kratos‚Äô very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.\n\nIn the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn‚Äôt the highest resolution experience I‚Äôve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.\n\nThe child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.\n\nContinuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it‚Äôs the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*\n\nWell, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.\n\nNevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn‚Äôt the best for purists since listening wasn‚Äôt fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.\n\n\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI don‚Äôt want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I‚Äôve tested. At least up to the **100‚Ç¨/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what‚Äôs the point of spending more money?\n\nI acknowledge it isn‚Äôt perfect. In fact, technically, it‚Äôs inferior to two other competitors in its price range I‚Äôve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I‚Äôm not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.\n\nThey have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn‚Äôt hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.\n\nMy sincerest congratulations to the brand.\n\nThank you for reading if you‚Äôve made it this far.\n\n**See you in the next review.**\n\n**Greetings!**",

I stopped using these headphones about a year ago. The ear cups I've changed multiple times in the past, that's not that much of an issue. The yellowing of the white plastic is also expected (these are from literally the first batch of Virtuosos when they were just released in 2019). BUT THE HEADBAND! The headband started peeling off not that long ago and then it started to quickly deteriorate after that. I stopped using the Virtuoso and started using my Raycons instead, then I got my Nothing Ear. They have been ok, but at the same time, the Virtuoso is there in a corner, forgotten and neglected, but it is an amazing headset and I'd really like to get back to using it.\n\n  \nThey still work! I haven't put them on for obvious reasons (they have of course gotten much worse after not being touched for a while in a humid environment), but they still work.  \nI do not need headphones. I don't even game anymore. But sometimes I just want to use them and I can't in their current state.\n\nI also want to note I'm neither an audiophile nor a consumerist, and that's why I wouldn't even consider replacing them instead of just fixing them up a little bit if they still work just fine.",

    "title": "Myer Audio SLIIVO SL224 Earphones Review",
    "selftext": "I didn't expect much from Myer Audio, and I didn't really follow their work. The CKLVX D62 model is still popular, although it gets a lot more attention than it really deserves, I think; the SL41 MK2 one was excellent, but the next few models didn't seem to stand out in the stream of endless Chinese specialties.\n\nTherefore, I approached the next model, SLIIVO SL224, with minimum expectations. My loss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij95o9whopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2c35707a8bb0ad7bea5154dacf5740c96e62d49\n\nToday, we'll talk about SLIIVO SL224, in-ear headphones priced at $285 (as of October 2025).\n\n# All but the sound\n\nThe earphones are delivered in a cardboard box, normal-sized for the earphones of this price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46te32ckopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaf049b747a3e2612525251c1f342557f1e6e261\n\nIn the box, we can find the earphones themselves, a round leather case, 7 pairs of eartips, and a cable with replaceable connectors. No surprises.\n\nThe cable is beautiful, nice, with a resistance of 0.3 Ohms. The connectors are inserted and fixed to the cable with coarse-threaded nuts. This approach feels reliable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yq7y8nlopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e39369d65e608cae16450636cf618925bd366a2c\n\nIn addition to the 3.5 and 4.4 mm connectors, a Type-C connector was also included, which, of course, is not a connector at all, but a DAC. The DAC works exclusively in 16-bit/48 kHz mode, in Plug'n'play mode, with standard drivers in Windows 11, if nothing else. There are no special drivers on the [manufacturer's website](https://myeraudio.com/) (however, the website looks like it's being barely maintained, to put it mildly). The Walk Play app doesn't see it. But thanks for including it anyway.\n\nThere are 3 pairs of slightly tighter silicone eartips of a standard shape, sizes S, M and L...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xtkizhnopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1d969d57be38137156ba8de6bb85674f71f3ff\n\n...3 more pairs of slightly softer silicone eartips...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w63t0snoopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20fc14caa0167803e16403be6c068333bf719521\n\n...as well as 1 pair of foam ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy6v1cxpopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cca6a13136ec2ef430ce9374cb05ea4469a0a812\n\nThe earphones themselves are technically made on the basis of a menagerie of 2 dynamic (6 and 10 mm), 2 armature and 4 microplanar drivers, or a total of 8 drivers in each earphone. Each of the driver types plays back lower, middle, and upper frequencies, respectively.\n\nThe earphones' enclosures are made of polymer resin and have a pronounced relief, that is, ergonomic depressions and projections.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfydif6ropxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0e22a05e4a02671e7249bbe0040085de8fcb5d1\n\nThe earphones are designed for an average depth of the fit and have standard diameters of sound ducts by modern standards, so you can experiment with eartips at great length and with abandon: SpinFit CP100+, Pentaconn COREIR, Roseselsa SoundCocoon, Divinus Prism Wide Bore ‚Äì [they all](https://boizoff.com/eartips_part_4/) fit and let you comfortably place the earphones in your ears. I never managed to settle on anything specific, as they all are fine.\n\nI can't say anything bad about SL224 in terms of user experience and ergonomics ‚Äì they're just well-made modern in-ear headphones without any pitfalls. Of course, their black polished plastic surface scratches quickly and collects fingerprints, but that's how 99% of all headphones are made now, so there's nothing we can do. I can also complain about the case: for the earphones of this size and the cable of this length and thickness, this case is frankly small. Give me a bigger one now!\n\nAs for the electrical characteristics, the manufacturer claims a resistance of 36 Œ© and a sensitivity of 108 dB. I can't comment on the second value, but I've recently become able to measure resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vktmk7topxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0087afee237e878d735e0bae6214e181dd579035\n\nIt varies from 34 to 14 Œ©.\n\n# The sound\n\n*Standard links:*\n\n1. *the description of my rig is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/renovation-of-my-measuring-rig-for-headphones/)*;*\n2. *the audiogram of my hearing is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/audiogram/)*;*\n3. *articles on measurement theory and the whole shebang are* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/category/audiophile/theory/)*.*\n\nFrequency response of SLIIVO SL224 earphones with original foam eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hfl2191ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cea47660d534a586276350a062dc957e1a569d4\n\nAnd, before analyzing the frequency response, let me remind you that this frequency response will strongly depend on the depth of the fit. Frequency response of SL224 for the second resonance at 7000, 7500, 8000 and 8500 Hz:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lbyhjm2ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb404456030ce4a4c3f442905acc9d1c7a41284\n\nNote that there is no simple displacement of the resonant peak. On the contrary, the entire range from 3 to 20 kHz changes significantly, and only the emphasis at 12 kHz remains more or less stable in terms of volume and 'width', so to speak. The key thing that can be seen from these graphs is that the deeper the earphones are placed in the auditory canals, the lower the area before the second resonance 'droops' and the higher the peak rises around 15 kHz.\n\nComparison of frequency response for original foam and silicone eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg8uwbu4ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c2be14aaa3c3c99ba0cf535c6d00c6b7b3175bc\n\nAnyway, we can see the following on the graphs:\n\n* it seems to be a more or less typical sound delivery a la Harman;\n* but with reduced subbass;\n* and with a 'muffled', but rather 'smooth' 4-10 kHz segment;\n* as well as with an expansion after 10 kHz, the nature of which depends on the eartips. The graph obtained when using silicone eartips is more valid for my ears.\n\nBesides, consider a slight rise in the bass, about 250 Hz, as well as the shape of the 600 Hz to 3 kHz segment ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost linear. We'll talk below how this affects the SL224 sound perception.\n\nNonlinear distortion at 94 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g2c9x48ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=031fd6a69ca193c02a48b3996e51ed689a3e213e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrc4ao19ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3afce27b77c8e94f80bfa77f522bdc0e82f1eec\n\nNonlinear distortion at 104 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_1.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_1.jpg)\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_2.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_2.jpg)\n\nThere's not much to comment on here: at 94 dB, the distortion is just over 0.5% at the maximum; at 104 dB volume, it's over 1%. That is, they have no audible effect on the sound.\n\nMinimum phase response, group delay, and spectrogram in the 'Burst decay' mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kxxdhfdppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbabddd9448e7feaa7bfba5bd9e255749fba11db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfq42o6eppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=258891b29d856b4a4102a1ee88176893e93ffc2b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jadpkhseppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e62b9f7e963ddeb411d1c3629b85179cc9f17a3\n\nIt's a common near-ideal pattern, typical for all modern in-ears of a similar price.\n\nMy subjective evaluation is that I'm blown away primarily by how full-fledged the SL224 sound delivery turned out to be. And I deliberately don't use the word 'balanced' because it refers to the concept of neutrality. Literally everything in the sound of these earphones is in place. All frequencies are exactly in the amount that my ear personally expects. There is a very, very weighty, but technical subbass, a 'close' articulated middle with a hearing-friendly range at about 6-8 kHz, and an airy lightness after 10 kHz. It's very difficult to describe this sound because it's 'correct' and 'tasty' at the same time. In other words, you definitely won't be able to complain about tonal inaccuracy as it's at a very high level, but you also have this feeling of a 'spectacular' sound. It's difficult for me to clearly connect this with measurement graphs, but I assume that it's the linear range of 600-3000 Hz (and here we can move on to an endless debate about how to correctly combine frequency response graphs for comparison), as well as some emphasis on ultra-high frequencies that speak for themselves.\n\nA standalone interesting quality of these earphones, which I really appreciate and which is relatively rare, is the instrument sound separation. It's just splendid. You can listen to each vocal line, percussion, each component of the track separately and distinguish its perception from the overall musical flow.\n\nMoreover, the width of the sound stage is clearly larger than average. SL224 play in a large-scale, airy manner, and the recording space noticeably lives and breathes. The music plays 'around your head' and even more or less from behind rather than between your ears.\n\nAs one would expect with such sound delivery, these earphones are very versatile in terms of suitable musical content. The only limitation, apart from your taste, is the quality of tracks. If a sound engineer has been careful about recording and processing of the high frequency area, everything will be fine. If they haven't, you will be hearing weird and unpleasant things.\n\n# Comparisons\n\nIf we compare within the price category, guided by the [best online rating of in-ear monitors](https://boizoff.com/language/en/the-best-iems/), then the following models will be next to SL224:\n\n* PULA ANVIL 114\n* Letshuoer Cadenza 4\n* Kiwi Ears Orchestra Lite.\n\nI have compared them, of course, up-close and personal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1p7xn3ippxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0934c4bb516dc35126dc0ced23e9d82aefefd3ec\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to ANVIL 114: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_ANVIL114.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_ANVIL114.png)\n\nWhen A/B-ing, ANVIL 114 fully justify their name, hitting the listener's ears with a steel hammer: this is a massive, 'fat' sound supported by a bone conduction driver against the rather neutral, 'elegant' SL224 sound delivery.\n\n\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Cadenza 4: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Cadenza\\_4.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Cadenza_4.png)\n\nCadenza 4 are an example of excellent 'light' headphones. Compared to SL224, they have more 'top' and less 'bottom' in almost identical proportions. The Cadenza 4's sound delivery is 'airier', lighter, 'sparklier', and they have a slightly smoother section after 10 kHz, while SL224, again, are more neutral and, therefore, more versatile in comparison.\n\n\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Orchestra Lite: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Orchestra\\_Lite.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Orchestra_Lite.png)\n\nWe love Orchestra Lite for their infinitely expressive 'middle'. It seems that Orchestra Lite deliver sound even 'closer' to the listener, and they're a little brighter if we evaluate the sound delivery by and large, but SL224 win in terms of reliability and 'punch'.\n\n\n\nIf we look at the SL224 tuning conceptually, so to speak, then we need to compare them with completely different earphones ‚Äì [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/) and [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o78vvvipppxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ca90c5ee84b8406929c106d0d5555ef26ddc5b\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Meteor: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Meteor.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Meteor.png)\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Mega5-EST: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Mega5-EST.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Mega5-EST.png)\n\nAll three graphs compared:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mna3exppxf1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65aac9b4a17b9c969bac7fa6de31bcb38d5dc526\n\nCompared to Meteor, SL224 have a weightier bass and subbass due to a less pronounced middle; the Meteor sound seems sterile and faded against SL224. And, compared to Mega5-EST SL224, on the contrary, they're slightly less bassy, and the midrange is more pronounced. By ear, the SL224's sound delivery is almost perfectly equidistant from the tunings of these two models. The only thing that SL224 don't have is a smooth (by ear) frequency response after 10 kHz, which competitors can boast of. SL224 deliver this segment clearer, but less accurate. But prices vary accordingly, too.\n\nThe only aspect where I can name the best option for less money is gaming: from a positioning point of view, [KBEAR Cepheus](https://boizoff.com/language/en/kbear-cepheus-earphones-review/) remain unattainable and subjectively the best headphones for competitive games. But SL224 are also quite good in this context, don't get me wrong.\n\n# Summary\n\nI believe that the SL224's entry into the market is a significant milestone in the modern headphone industry. The SL224 is as iconic a model as [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/), [EPZ K9](https://boizoff.com/language/en/epz-k9-earphones-review/) or [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/) in their categories.\n\nAs for the sound‚Ä¶ I'm willing to pay to see the first reaction to the SL224 sound of someone for whom these earphones will be the first or second under the sun, as the wow effect from their first listening is so intense, and they differ so much from 'just headphones' and any TWS. SL224 are tuned just superbly: their sound delivery is simultaneously engaging, especially if you turn up the volume, but also reliable and large-scale in the sense of a virtual sound stage.\n\nWho won't like them? 'Bassheads' and fans of listening to music in the conditions of high ambient noise, that is, on the streets of a big city (noise masking will reduce the sound of these headphones to medium and high frequencies only).\n\nTo buy or not to buy? To buy!  \n",

However, I am experiencing some extremely harsh, sharp and painful kind of sibilance to some vocals on some tracks. For example from 1:43-1:55 on Duckworth by Kendrick Lamar. This happens mostly on s-sounds.\n\nI found that I had to meticulously EQ around 9800 Hz (q factor of 3), reducing it by around 6-7 dB in order to get rid of this painful sound. However, I find that doing this makes the overall sound more dull, dark and less defined. I'm not sure what to do. Measurement of the AR5000's frequency response shows a big peak at around 9500 Hz, could this perhaps be why? I did not see Resolve mention this problem in his review of the headphones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/undw3zt1kpxf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c527c80ede8fe7708253b26ec1c84e2adf4e1f8\n\nI have a pair of airpods pro 2 that i have no problems with. No painful sharp vocals.\n\nIs this a common problem among people? And is having to perform such a big EQ change even acceptable?  \nAm i experiencing this because I have a weird HRTF?  \nPerhaps any owners of the AR5000 that can give their thoughts and experience with this?",

    "selftext": "**Without EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth: best all rounder, widest soundstage, great imaging, superior separation, hefty bass\n2. Arya Stealth: sterile, thin sounding, decent bass\n3. HE6se V2: less refined than Arya Stealth, very neutral and clinical, honky and boxy telephone-like sound (some may prefer this), very fast and dynamic.\n\n**With EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth (does not require EQ): still the best allrounder\n2. HE6se V2: very natural and smooth, great 3D sound with slightly less stage size than Arya Sealth, more weight and slam, excellent midrange, amazing separation\n3. Arya Stealth: fuller and richer but less emphasis than HE6 in many ways, slightly more balanced and smoother, good overall sound for a number of different use cases\n\nBoth the HE6se V2 (EQ'd) and HE1000 Stealth trade blows. It's definitely no slouch and ever so slightly prefer it over the HE1000 Stealth with certain genres such as rock and metal. For everything else including classical music, and videogame/movie OST's such as LOTR, Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 etc. the HE1000 Stealth is the overall winner, including Rap and Hip-Hop.\n\nThe most noticeable factors of the HE1000 Stealth over the Arya Stealth is note weight and staging. Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be ¬£3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by Edifier or have any commercial interests in selling headphones. I just like music and love a good deal.\n\nThe Edifier WH950NB likely need no introduction; they launched for ‚Ç¨150 in Europe two years ago, have been around ‚Ç¨110 for a long time, and the white model has dipped to ‚Ç¨71 for a week a few months ago. I bought them on launch, and waited for a long time to form my opinion.\n\nI commute a few hours with them daily, and charge them once a week. I'm coming from a Hifiman Deva Pro, Sennheiser HD58X, and HD560S. I cannot overstate it: these headphones are phenomenal. Not \"good enough for Bluetooth headphones\", no, I often use them as my preferred listening experience over the others.\n\nHere's the secret: you get a (somewhat restricted) parametric EQ in the Edifier app. However, I created a preset from data (and my ears) that sounds so, so much better than the default tuning (see attached image for graphs):\n\n39Hz -3dB 2.0 (Optional)\n\n3000Hz -8dB 2.0\n\n3300Hz 3dB 2.0\n\n9000Hz 3dB 0.5\n\nIf you use UAPP on Android you can do automatic sample rate switching so you bypass Android's resampler on LDAC, and with some extra parametric EQ bands in UAPP you can improve the sound signature slightly more (I can add my preset in a comment if anyone is interested).\n\nOther than sound signature, these do everything you'd expect from a modern pair of BT headphones. There's passive and active 3.5mm support, a massive two-week battery, multiple ANC modes, multi-point Bluetooth 5.3, 96/32 LDAC, safe volume limiter, low latency mode, theater surround sound mode, and most importantly, an amazing travel case with a bunch of accessoires included (airplane splitter, usb-c cable, 3.5mm L-shape cable, protection pad for the folded cup).\n\nGenuinely wondering how no one is talking about these. Some of my family members, friends and colleagues bought one on my recommendation and they all think it's an amazing product. I only hear about the ‚Ç¨300+ products from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser etc.\n\nIs there anyone else that has these?\n\nEdit: Formatting",

    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it‚Äôs tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For ‚Äúheavier‚Äù music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that‚Äôs clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It‚Äôs an excellent headphone and if you don‚Äôt AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man...

It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring.

So going from there, how would you EQ if you wanted these close to Harman? My hearing isn't particularly precise and I am really not good with EQ'ing by feel so instead I usually just AutoEQ my headphones either towards an established target curve or the signature of other headphones.\n\nBest regards",

    "title": "CCA CRA+: pure fun at a ridiculous price.",
    "selftext": "Hello Community!\n\nThis time it's the review of a low-cost product, but just because it costs little money doesn't mean we should forget about this range. In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO JA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**‚Ç¨13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 ‚Ç¨/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of ‚Ç¨30 than one of ‚Ç¨100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶let's start with the **package content:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† User manual\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the ‚Ç¨13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but‚Ä¶ the highs got easily out of control‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶ I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is‚Ä¶ somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child‚Äôs voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors‚Äô behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies‚Äô guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **‚Ç¨13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n¬†",

Very pretty.\n\nAroma audio jewel: slight driver flex, treble is good, insanely overpriced, the fei want is nicer.\n\nVitrum mirph 1: relaxing tuning, very pleasant, really well made, the owner is a very cool dude, we had a very long conversation that was really insightful on how headphones are made.\n\nVitrum Mirph 2: more intense tuning, very nice sparkle in the treble, quite wide, more to my personal tastes than the mirph 1, I'm hype for its release, hopefully more people can get their hands on it.\n\nAful explorer: very smooth but way too dark for me, not as good as either the hexa or the pure\n\nAful cantor: insanely tinny, treble is extremely metallic, I like my treble but this is way too much, couldn't make it 2 minutes \n\nAwful dawn x: completely murders the cantor in every aspect, better treble, better mids, better bass, better fit, a pretty good iem but at the price wouldn't be my pick.\n\nFinal audio a10000: incredibly smooth, very relaxing tuning, sacrifices a bit of technicalities for it.\n\nGold planar gl600: the definition of a nothing planar, I will forget everything about it as soon as I take it off my head, at least they look cool.\n\nArpegear hane: bit sharp on the treble, probably can be adjusted with the switches but I don't have the time to do so, still inferior to the hexa and the pure.\n\nNoble audio knight: very musical, smooth, not the most exciting but quite nice, very well built.\n\nNoble audio van Gogh: tiny shell, it's got a world of slamming subwoofer bass, not my style of tuning but still very fun\n\nNoble audio agis 2: exciting without being overwhelming, expensive but I think worth the price.\n\nNoble audio shogun: really impressive detail and technicalities, more on the colored side, the cable is the best I've ever handled and the touch of the aux being a sword is really fun.\n\nNoble audio Kronos: my beloved chronicle, reincarnated, as good as I remembered, still the best audio product I've ever heard. \n",

    "selftext": "These have supplanted the Sennheiser HD6xx as my favorite open back and the one I use daily. The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else. I would be perfectly happy with these as my open back and Aeon Closed RT as my closed back for the forseeable future.",

    "selftext": "So, in the \"I'm Exploring the World\" column, I decided to listen to something other than electrostatic there must be other headphones out there, right?\n\nI thought I should try a TOTL of dynamic and planar headphones.\n\nSo, I found the\n\n* Sennheiser HD800/HD800S\n* and Focal Utopia 2022\n* and Hifiman Susvara OG\n\nLet's start with the Hifiman Susvara. Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones. I'd certainly like to hear the top-end Sony R10s or something like the Spirit Torino Valkyria and there are plenty of planar headphones out there..",

    "title": "Aune N7 Class A Headphone Amp - Stunning Power and Value",
    "selftext": "Here's a trimmed down version of my full review over on head-fi. You can find it [here](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/aune-n7.28592/reviews).\n\n# Aune N7 Review ‚Äî Mojo 2 Finds Its Match\n\nAfter upgrading to the Hifiman Arya Stealth, I wanted a proper Class A amp to bring out their full potential. I‚Äôve long used the Chord Mojo 2 as my main DAC/amp ‚Äî a brilliant device ‚Äî but I suspected pairing it with a pure Class A amp might unlock something new. Enter the **Aune N7**.\n\n# Build & Design\n\nCompact, solid, and purposeful ‚Äî the **N7**‚Äôs machined aluminum chassis with side heat fins looks serious and feels premium. The **volume knob** clicks smoothly but can skip if turned too fast. The **aluminum remote** feels fantastic, though its **volume buttons** could be better placed.  \nThe **display** is functional but small; no brightness control. As expected from a Class A amp, it runs warm ‚Äî hand-warmer warm, not egg-frying hot. The internal temperature stays around 45¬∞C even after long sessions.\n\n# Listening Setup\n\n**Chain:** Spotify Lossless ‚Üí WiiM Mini ‚Üí Mojo 2 ‚Üí Aune N7 ‚Üí Hifiman Arya Stealth (balanced out, high gain/high current).\n\n# Sound Impressions\n\n* **Steely Dan ‚Äì ‚ÄúAja‚Äù**: The N7 adds depth and weight, expanding the soundstage front-to-back. Bass gains texture; cymbals smooth out; the sax solo feels more alive. Some upper-mid sparkle is softened, but the trade-off is cohesion.\n* **Bill Evans Trio ‚Äì ‚ÄúSunday at the Village Vanguard‚Äù**: The sense of space and realism jumps. You don‚Äôt just hear LaFaro‚Äôs bass ‚Äî you feel it resonate. Evans‚Äô piano takes on body and warmth, and brushwork on the snare is wonderfully tactile.\n* **Snarky Puppy ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe Like It Here‚Äù**: A perfect showcase for the N7‚Äôs Class A dynamics. Everything stays tight and layered even in dense sections. You lose a touch of bite on transients, but gain richness and flow.\n* **Martha Argerich ‚Äì Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3**: The Mojo alone is precise but dry. Add the N7 and the sound breathes ‚Äî the piano has weight and the hall ambience comes alive.\n* **Entheogenic ‚Äì ‚ÄúDreamtime Physics‚Äù**: Electronica gains dimension and slam. Sub-bass digs deeper, highs shimmer smoothly, and the sound feels enveloping. The N7‚Äôs black background lets microdetails emerge effortlessly.\n\n# Tonal Character\n\nThe **N7** sits between **neutral and warm**, adding body without syrup. It turns the Mojo 2‚Äôs clinical precision into a more natural, organic presentation ‚Äî like switching from a microscope to a beautifully developed photo. Mids are dense, bass tight, highs extended yet smooth.\n\n# Noise & Power\n\nAbsolutely silent, even at high gain. The Arya Stealth reaches satisfying levels around 10‚Äì15/30 volume steps, leaving plenty of headroom. Rated at **6.5W @ 32Œ© balanced**, the N7 drives demanding planars effortlessly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe **Aune N7** is a **$399 Class A gem** ‚Äî compact, powerful, and genuinely musical. It transforms the Mojo 2 from analytical to alive, and makes the Arya Stealth sound more organic and fatigue-free.  \nIf you want long, engaging sessions and real Class A smoothness without spending big or cluttering your desk, this is the one. Mine‚Äôs staying put ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the best endorsement I can give.",

    "title": "In the market: DCA Noire XO or E3?",
    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI know the question is odd since it's a open vs closed back DCA, however I am in the market for a new set. For my listening tastes, my 6XX doesn't cut it. I then got a planar FT1 Pro and the widened soundstage is nice, but I hate certain aspects of the headphones (including the stock pads and putting on some Dekoni LCD-type pads certainly changed the headphones too much) and I find it really sounds bad when I drive them with EQ that brings it closer to Harman. The dips I can hear in 2K-5K is very annoying to try and EQ properly and I haven't been able to make it right with the new pads; they're either distant or very grating.\n\nConversly, I noticed that once I tuned my 6XX's close to Harman using ortary's EQ, I vastly enjoyed the sound more, but the technical aspects of the 6XX's were starting to bug me, like the lack of Impact of bass and the narrow soundstage,\n\nHence my look into DCA's more Harman tuned headphones. I have heard very good things about E3, namely that it has a vast sound-stage for a closed back, large drivers/earcups (I do have a big fuggin head), etc. etc. However, now that I see that the Noire XO is out for several hundred less, I am also looking at these, namely on DMS' recommendation and his bit about \"if you LPF after 10k, you effectively get E3\". Pair the Noire XO's promising looking bass response, I am at a bit of a decision paralysis between the two for an end-game desktop setup.\n\nSo, for people that have listened to one or the other, is the E3 worth it for the extra money vs the Noire XO in your own personal opinion? What about for someone like myself that wants a more Harman tuned, wider soundstage headphone? It's one thing to say \"has a wide soundstage for a closed back\", but then how does it compare to an actual open back in the Noire XO?\n\nThanks! :)\n\ne; I also don't live anywhere near a place to test each.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

    "selftext": "**Hello community!**\n\nHere I am again, writing another review, with my music playing and my extra long black coffee nice and hot, and, although I already had all my ideas organized in my head, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to give another listen to the model I present today: **Kefine Delci AE**, released in 2024.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present **my sources:**\n\n\\-FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.  \n\\-FiiO KA13 while working.  \n\\-FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.  \n\\-FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.  \n\\-FiiO KA11.  \n\\-FiiO JA11.  \n\\-Macbook Air M4 3.5mm output.  \n\\-Shanling M0 Pro. **NEW!!**  \n\\-Amazon Music Ultimate.  \n\\-Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons:**\n\n\\-Pros  \n\\>The most comfortable set I‚Äôve ever tried.  \n\\>Works very well with any source.  \n\\>Very wide soundstage in all three axes.  \n\\>Solid, fun, precise sub-bass and bass.  \n\\>Clear, present, and layered mids.\n\n\\-Cons:  \n\\>Cable connections are not interchangeable.  \n\\>The gold filter makes the high frequencies aggressive.  \n\\>Treble a little compressed.  \n\\>The cable slider doesn‚Äôt stay fixed.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis set of monitors was provided by the brand **Kefine** and **Mr. Yang**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.\n\nThe price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65‚Ç¨**.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn‚Äôt have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.\n\nMy surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle‚Ä¶ but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.\n\n\n\n**Will they meet my tastes?**\n\nFirst, let‚Äôs look at the **package contents:**\n\n\\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  \n\\-User **manual**.  \n\\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  \n\\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  \n\\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  \n\\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  \n\\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.\n\n\n\n**They look comfortable, right?**\n\nThis is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.\n\nThe answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn‚Äôt have started better.\n\nThe capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone‚Äôs auricle and ear canal.\n\nFor this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.\n\nThe cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn‚Äôt tangle, and doesn‚Äôt pull by catching on your clothing.\n\nI don‚Äôt know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.\n\nWhat I didn‚Äôt find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn‚Äôt fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.\n\n\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n\\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  \n\\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  \n\\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  \n\\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz\n\nThe **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.\n\nI would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.\n\n\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nThese **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.\n\nMy experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.\n\nI could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone‚Äôs intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.\n\nHowever, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.\n\n*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn‚Äôt the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.\n\n*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn‚Äôt interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.\n\n*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.\n\n*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don‚Äôt feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.\n\n*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.\n\n*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don‚Äôt need more, nor do I want it.\n\n*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors‚Äô tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.\n\n*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.\n\n*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.\n\n**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.\n\nRegarding **layering**: I don‚Äôt know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can‚Äôt believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.\n\n\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.\n\nI encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\nThe source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.\n\nIn the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.\n\nIn *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.\n\nRegarding Kratos‚Äô very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.\n\nIn the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn‚Äôt the highest resolution experience I‚Äôve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.\n\nThe child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.\n\nContinuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it‚Äôs the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*\n\nWell, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.\n\nNevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn‚Äôt the best for purists since listening wasn‚Äôt fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.\n\n\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI don‚Äôt want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I‚Äôve tested. At least up to the **100‚Ç¨/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what‚Äôs the point of spending more money?\n\nI acknowledge it isn‚Äôt perfect. In fact, technically, it‚Äôs inferior to two other competitors in its price range I‚Äôve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I‚Äôm not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.\n\nThey have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn‚Äôt hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.\n\nMy sincerest congratulations to the brand.\n\nThank you for reading if you‚Äôve made it this far.\n\n**See you in the next review.**\n\n**Greetings!**",

    "selftext": "I didn't expect much from Myer Audio, and I didn't really follow their work. The CKLVX D62 model is still popular, although it gets a lot more attention than it really deserves, I think; the SL41 MK2 one was excellent, but the next few models didn't seem to stand out in the stream of endless Chinese specialties.\n\nTherefore, I approached the next model, SLIIVO SL224, with minimum expectations. My loss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij95o9whopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2c35707a8bb0ad7bea5154dacf5740c96e62d49\n\nToday, we'll talk about SLIIVO SL224, in-ear headphones priced at $285 (as of October 2025).\n\n# All but the sound\n\nThe earphones are delivered in a cardboard box, normal-sized for the earphones of this price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46te32ckopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaf049b747a3e2612525251c1f342557f1e6e261\n\nIn the box, we can find the earphones themselves, a round leather case, 7 pairs of eartips, and a cable with replaceable connectors. No surprises.\n\nThe cable is beautiful, nice, with a resistance of 0.3 Ohms. The connectors are inserted and fixed to the cable with coarse-threaded nuts. This approach feels reliable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yq7y8nlopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e39369d65e608cae16450636cf618925bd366a2c\n\nIn addition to the 3.5 and 4.4 mm connectors, a Type-C connector was also included, which, of course, is not a connector at all, but a DAC. The DAC works exclusively in 16-bit/48 kHz mode, in Plug'n'play mode, with standard drivers in Windows 11, if nothing else. There are no special drivers on the [manufacturer's website](https://myeraudio.com/) (however, the website looks like it's being barely maintained, to put it mildly). The Walk Play app doesn't see it. But thanks for including it anyway.\n\nThere are 3 pairs of slightly tighter silicone eartips of a standard shape, sizes S, M and L...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xtkizhnopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1d969d57be38137156ba8de6bb85674f71f3ff\n\n...3 more pairs of slightly softer silicone eartips...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w63t0snoopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20fc14caa0167803e16403be6c068333bf719521\n\n...as well as 1 pair of foam ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy6v1cxpopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cca6a13136ec2ef430ce9374cb05ea4469a0a812\n\nThe earphones themselves are technically made on the basis of a menagerie of 2 dynamic (6 and 10 mm), 2 armature and 4 microplanar drivers, or a total of 8 drivers in each earphone. Each of the driver types plays back lower, middle, and upper frequencies, respectively.\n\nThe earphones' enclosures are made of polymer resin and have a pronounced relief, that is, ergonomic depressions and projections.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfydif6ropxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0e22a05e4a02671e7249bbe0040085de8fcb5d1\n\nThe earphones are designed for an average depth of the fit and have standard diameters of sound ducts by modern standards, so you can experiment with eartips at great length and with abandon: SpinFit CP100+, Pentaconn COREIR, Roseselsa SoundCocoon, Divinus Prism Wide Bore ‚Äì [they all](https://boizoff.com/eartips_part_4/) fit and let you comfortably place the earphones in your ears. I never managed to settle on anything specific, as they all are fine.\n\nI can't say anything bad about SL224 in terms of user experience and ergonomics ‚Äì they're just well-made modern in-ear headphones without any pitfalls. Of course, their black polished plastic surface scratches quickly and collects fingerprints, but that's how 99% of all headphones are made now, so there's nothing we can do. I can also complain about the case: for the earphones of this size and the cable of this length and thickness, this case is frankly small. Give me a bigger one now!\n\nAs for the electrical characteristics, the manufacturer claims a resistance of 36 Œ© and a sensitivity of 108 dB. I can't comment on the second value, but I've recently become able to measure resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vktmk7topxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0087afee237e878d735e0bae6214e181dd579035\n\nIt varies from 34 to 14 Œ©.\n\n# The sound\n\n*Standard links:*\n\n1. *the description of my rig is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/renovation-of-my-measuring-rig-for-headphones/)*;*\n2. *the audiogram of my hearing is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/audiogram/)*;*\n3. *articles on measurement theory and the whole shebang are* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/category/audiophile/theory/)*.*\n\nFrequency response of SLIIVO SL224 earphones with original foam eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hfl2191ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cea47660d534a586276350a062dc957e1a569d4\n\nAnd, before analyzing the frequency response, let me remind you that this frequency response will strongly depend on the depth of the fit. Frequency response of SL224 for the second resonance at 7000, 7500, 8000 and 8500 Hz:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lbyhjm2ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb404456030ce4a4c3f442905acc9d1c7a41284\n\nNote that there is no simple displacement of the resonant peak. On the contrary, the entire range from 3 to 20 kHz changes significantly, and only the emphasis at 12 kHz remains more or less stable in terms of volume and 'width', so to speak. The key thing that can be seen from these graphs is that the deeper the earphones are placed in the auditory canals, the lower the area before the second resonance 'droops' and the higher the peak rises around 15 kHz.\n\nComparison of frequency response for original foam and silicone eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg8uwbu4ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c2be14aaa3c3c99ba0cf535c6d00c6b7b3175bc\n\nAnyway, we can see the following on the graphs:\n\n* it seems to be a more or less typical sound delivery a la Harman;\n* but with reduced subbass;\n* and with a 'muffled', but rather 'smooth' 4-10 kHz segment;\n* as well as with an expansion after 10 kHz, the nature of which depends on the eartips. The graph obtained when using silicone eartips is more valid for my ears.\n\nBesides, consider a slight rise in the bass, about 250 Hz, as well as the shape of the 600 Hz to 3 kHz segment ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost linear. We'll talk below how this affects the SL224 sound perception.\n\nNonlinear distortion at 94 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g2c9x48ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=031fd6a69ca193c02a48b3996e51ed689a3e213e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrc4ao19ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3afce27b77c8e94f80bfa77f522bdc0e82f1eec\n\nNonlinear distortion at 104 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_1.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_1.jpg)\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_2.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_2.jpg)\n\nThere's not much to comment on here: at 94 dB, the distortion is just over 0.5% at the maximum; at 104 dB volume, it's over 1%. That is, they have no audible effect on the sound.\n\nMinimum phase response, group delay, and spectrogram in the 'Burst decay' mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kxxdhfdppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbabddd9448e7feaa7bfba5bd9e255749fba11db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfq42o6eppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=258891b29d856b4a4102a1ee88176893e93ffc2b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jadpkhseppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e62b9f7e963ddeb411d1c3629b85179cc9f17a3\n\nIt's a common near-ideal pattern, typical for all modern in-ears of a similar price.\n\nMy subjective evaluation is that I'm blown away primarily by how full-fledged the SL224 sound delivery turned out to be. And I deliberately don't use the word 'balanced' because it refers to the concept of neutrality. Literally everything in the sound of these earphones is in place. All frequencies are exactly in the amount that my ear personally expects. There is a very, very weighty, but technical subbass, a 'close' articulated middle with a hearing-friendly range at about 6-8 kHz, and an airy lightness after 10 kHz. It's very difficult to describe this sound because it's 'correct' and 'tasty' at the same time. In other words, you definitely won't be able to complain about tonal inaccuracy as it's at a very high level, but you also have this feeling of a 'spectacular' sound. It's difficult for me to clearly connect this with measurement graphs, but I assume that it's the linear range of 600-3000 Hz (and here we can move on to an endless debate about how to correctly combine frequency response graphs for comparison), as well as some emphasis on ultra-high frequencies that speak for themselves.\n\nA standalone interesting quality of these earphones, which I really appreciate and which is relatively rare, is the instrument sound separation. It's just splendid. You can listen to each vocal line, percussion, each component of the track separately and distinguish its perception from the overall musical flow.\n\nMoreover, the width of the sound stage is clearly larger than average. SL224 play in a large-scale, airy manner, and the recording space noticeably lives and breathes. The music plays 'around your head' and even more or less from behind rather than between your ears.\n\nAs one would expect with such sound delivery, these earphones are very versatile in terms of suitable musical content. The only limitation, apart from your taste, is the quality of tracks. If a sound engineer has been careful about recording and processing of the high frequency area, everything will be fine. If they haven't, you will be hearing weird and unpleasant things.\n\n# Comparisons\n\nIf we compare within the price category, guided by the [best online rating of in-ear monitors](https://boizoff.com/language/en/the-best-iems/), then the following models will be next to SL224:\n\n* PULA ANVIL 114\n* Letshuoer Cadenza 4\n* Kiwi Ears Orchestra Lite.\n\nI have compared them, of course, up-close and personal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1p7xn3ippxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0934c4bb516dc35126dc0ced23e9d82aefefd3ec\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to ANVIL 114: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_ANVIL114.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_ANVIL114.png)\n\nWhen A/B-ing, ANVIL 114 fully justify their name, hitting the listener's ears with a steel hammer: this is a massive, 'fat' sound supported by a bone conduction driver against the rather neutral, 'elegant' SL224 sound delivery.\n\n\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Cadenza 4: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Cadenza\\_4.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Cadenza_4.png)\n\nCadenza 4 are an example of excellent 'light' headphones. Compared to SL224, they have more 'top' and less 'bottom' in almost identical proportions. The Cadenza 4's sound delivery is 'airier', lighter, 'sparklier', and they have a slightly smoother section after 10 kHz, while SL224, again, are more neutral and, therefore, more versatile in comparison.\n\n\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Orchestra Lite: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Orchestra\\_Lite.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Orchestra_Lite.png)\n\nWe love Orchestra Lite for their infinitely expressive 'middle'. It seems that Orchestra Lite deliver sound even 'closer' to the listener, and they're a little brighter if we evaluate the sound delivery by and large, but SL224 win in terms of reliability and 'punch'.\n\n\n\nIf we look at the SL224 tuning conceptually, so to speak, then we need to compare them with completely different earphones ‚Äì [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/) and [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o78vvvipppxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ca90c5ee84b8406929c106d0d5555ef26ddc5b\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Meteor: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Meteor.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Meteor.png)\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Mega5-EST: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Mega5-EST.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Mega5-EST.png)\n\nAll three graphs compared:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mna3exppxf1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65aac9b4a17b9c969bac7fa6de31bcb38d5dc526\n\nCompared to Meteor, SL224 have a weightier bass and subbass due to a less pronounced middle; the Meteor sound seems sterile and faded against SL224. And, compared to Mega5-EST SL224, on the contrary, they're slightly less bassy, and the midrange is more pronounced. By ear, the SL224's sound delivery is almost perfectly equidistant from the tunings of these two models. The only thing that SL224 don't have is a smooth (by ear) frequency response after 10 kHz, which competitors can boast of. SL224 deliver this segment clearer, but less accurate. But prices vary accordingly, too.\n\nThe only aspect where I can name the best option for less money is gaming: from a positioning point of view, [KBEAR Cepheus](https://boizoff.com/language/en/kbear-cepheus-earphones-review/) remain unattainable and subjectively the best headphones for competitive games. But SL224 are also quite good in this context, don't get me wrong.\n\n# Summary\n\nI believe that the SL224's entry into the market is a significant milestone in the modern headphone industry. The SL224 is as iconic a model as [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/), [EPZ K9](https://boizoff.com/language/en/epz-k9-earphones-review/) or [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/) in their categories.\n\nAs for the sound‚Ä¶ I'm willing to pay to see the first reaction to the SL224 sound of someone for whom these earphones will be the first or second under the sun, as the wow effect from their first listening is so intense, and they differ so much from 'just headphones' and any TWS. SL224 are tuned just superbly: their sound delivery is simultaneously engaging, especially if you turn up the volume, but also reliable and large-scale in the sense of a virtual sound stage.\n\nWho won't like them? 'Bassheads' and fans of listening to music in the conditions of high ambient noise, that is, on the streets of a big city (noise masking will reduce the sound of these headphones to medium and high frequencies only).\n\nTo buy or not to buy? To buy!  \n",

However, I am experiencing some extremely harsh, sharp and painful kind of sibilance to some vocals on some tracks. For example from 1:43-1:55 on Duckworth by Kendrick Lamar. This happens mostly on s-sounds.\n\nI found that I had to meticulously EQ around 9800 Hz (q factor of 3), reducing it by around 6-7 dB in order to get rid of this painful sound. However, I find that doing this makes the overall sound more dull, dark and less defined. I'm not sure what to do. Measurement of the AR5000's frequency response shows a big peak at around 9500 Hz, could this perhaps be why? I did not see Resolve mention this problem in his review of the headphones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/undw3zt1kpxf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c527c80ede8fe7708253b26ec1c84e2adf4e1f8\n\nI have a pair of airpods pro 2 that i have no problems with. No painful sharp vocals.\n\nIs this a common problem among people? And is having to perform such a big EQ change even acceptable?  \nAm i experiencing this because I have a weird HRTF?  \nPerhaps any owners of the AR5000 that can give their thoughts and experience with this?",

    "selftext": "**Without EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth: best all rounder, widest soundstage, great imaging, superior separation, hefty bass\n2. Arya Stealth: sterile, thin sounding, decent bass\n3. HE6se V2: less refined than Arya Stealth, very neutral and clinical, honky and boxy telephone-like sound (some may prefer this), very fast and dynamic.\n\n**With EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth (does not require EQ): still the best allrounder\n2. HE6se V2: very natural and smooth, great 3D sound with slightly less stage size than Arya Sealth, more weight and slam, excellent midrange, amazing separation\n3. Arya Stealth: fuller and richer but less emphasis than HE6 in many ways, slightly more balanced and smoother, good overall sound for a number of different use cases\n\nBoth the HE6se V2 (EQ'd) and HE1000 Stealth trade blows. It's definitely no slouch and ever so slightly prefer it over the HE1000 Stealth with certain genres such as rock and metal. For everything else including classical music, and videogame/movie OST's such as LOTR, Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 etc. the HE1000 Stealth is the overall winner, including Rap and Hip-Hop.\n\nThe most noticeable factors of the HE1000 Stealth over the Arya Stealth is note weight and staging. Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be ¬£3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by Edifier or have any commercial interests in selling headphones. I just like music and love a good deal.\n\nThe Edifier WH950NB likely need no introduction; they launched for ‚Ç¨150 in Europe two years ago, have been around ‚Ç¨110 for a long time, and the white model has dipped to ‚Ç¨71 for a week a few months ago. I bought them on launch, and waited for a long time to form my opinion.\n\nI commute a few hours with them daily, and charge them once a week. I'm coming from a Hifiman Deva Pro, Sennheiser HD58X, and HD560S. I cannot overstate it: these headphones are phenomenal. Not \"good enough for Bluetooth headphones\", no, I often use them as my preferred listening experience over the others.\n\nHere's the secret: you get a (somewhat restricted) parametric EQ in the Edifier app. However, I created a preset from data (and my ears) that sounds so, so much better than the default tuning (see attached image for graphs):\n\n39Hz -3dB 2.0 (Optional)\n\n3000Hz -8dB 2.0\n\n3300Hz 3dB 2.0\n\n9000Hz 3dB 0.5\n\nIf you use UAPP on Android you can do automatic sample rate switching so you bypass Android's resampler on LDAC, and with some extra parametric EQ bands in UAPP you can improve the sound signature slightly more (I can add my preset in a comment if anyone is interested).\n\nOther than sound signature, these do everything you'd expect from a modern pair of BT headphones. There's passive and active 3.5mm support, a massive two-week battery, multiple ANC modes, multi-point Bluetooth 5.3, 96/32 LDAC, safe volume limiter, low latency mode, theater surround sound mode, and most importantly, an amazing travel case with a bunch of accessoires included (airplane splitter, usb-c cable, 3.5mm L-shape cable, protection pad for the folded cup).\n\nGenuinely wondering how no one is talking about these. Some of my family members, friends and colleagues bought one on my recommendation and they all think it's an amazing product. I only hear about the ‚Ç¨300+ products from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser etc.\n\nIs there anyone else that has these?\n\nEdit: Formatting",

It stays like that for like 1-2 minutes and then it comes back to normal. \n\nSo I can understand it does that because of the temperature, but it would make sense for the fan to keep going as normal, but it doesn't, it slows down.\n\nIs it normal behavior? Or could it be a malfunction?\n\nWhat I do nowadays is that I limit the TDP to all games, I tend to max it to 10 TDP on high end games, which is where the SD doesn't get that hot so I don't suffer this problem.",

I‚Äôve had my LCD 512GB Deck for about three years now (I upgraded the SSD to 2TB over a year ago, I don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with my issues)\n\nBasically, the Deck is constantly freezing and locking up mid-game lately. Sometimes the system will fully reboot itself when I‚Äôm in the middle of a game, sometimes it‚Äôll simply freeze with the game hanging and none of the controls responding, forcing me to hold the power button to to force it off. Occasionally when this happens I also get the audio glitching and repeating, sort of like when you‚Äôd accidentally knock a CD player back in the day.\n\nI‚Äôve had my performance metrics on lately to see if there is any kind of overheating happening but it doesn‚Äôt appear so. Lately I‚Äôve been playing Hades 2 and Megabonk, both of which have frozen and crashed the Deck multiple times but I wouldn‚Äôt consider them hyper taxing games. I‚Äôve also had this issue while emulating old games.\n\nFrom Googling around for solutions I have tried switching from the Beta OS channel to the Stable, and back again. It hasn‚Äôt made any difference. Seems like the only other recommended option I‚Äôve seen online is doing a factory reset, which I would hate to do but if that‚Äôs what it takes, I‚Äôll do it. I have Decky installed and Cryoutilities. I‚Äôve had both for years. \n\nWondering if anyone here has any ideas. Thank you!\n",

    "selftext": "So I previously had a dual boot setup with windows but after it wiped my SteamOS partition during an update, it got wiped itself. Windows is not a viable way to play games unless you tinker and completely disable updates. SteamOS can do 95 percent of things except anti cheat. \n\nAnyway\nSo my previous thread I ran Fallout New Vegas through vorpx on windows and it ran pretty well but after wiping windows I still had the VR itch. \n\nSo I found ALVR works under steam OS so I thought I‚Äôd give it a test, and to my surprise it worked really well with almost no advanced tinkering. \n\nI went to desktop, installed ALVR then SteamVR. Installed the Firewall rules and still had ALVR on my quest 1. \nTried aircarVR as a test and got amazingly smooth performance, much better than I got under Windows, so I got adventurous and tried Skyrim VR.\n\nNow I‚Äôd previously tried to run SkyrimVR under windows and it simply would not work. It would CTD on launch and never worked. I read up some people had got it working but the amount of work was just ridiculous and not worth it. Everyone kept claiming the performance will be awful and unplayable. Well I‚Äôm here to quash that myth. It works amazingly well without mods and completely vanilla. A great start if you just want to play it as is. \n\nIt started up right away, no crashes and straight into the starting room. I loaded my save at whiterun and it performed great. I had a bit of slow down when loading in but other than that, smooth as butter. If you‚Äôre looking for a vanilla experience, I can say it works perfectly. I didn‚Äôt even change the performance preset from medium. If you encounter slowdown, then bumping that down would make it even better.\nIt looked a bit blurry but still completely playable, the blur can be fixed with mods and settings tweaks anyway but I didn‚Äôt do it. \n\nSo if you want to play Skyrim VR, it works on the deck. \nSome quick pointers to finish, \n\nIf you get a black screen with ALVR then you need to add the launch command on the GitHub. You need to add it to run ALVR no exceptions. \n\nMake sure you don‚Äôt suffocate your deck when you VR game, you‚Äôll end up with bad performance throttling and a melted console. Keep it ventilated and performance will remain stable. \n\nI lowered my resolution to match my Quest 1 within steamVR, so if you get performance issues, try lowering yours.\n\nI tried running ALVR in gaming mode but it had a black screen, I didn‚Äôt tinker further but that might be fixable. For now keep the deck in desktop mode for VR\n\nDon‚Äôt bother with windows for just VR. It‚Äôs more hassle than just using SteamOS. I originally dual booted for VR thinking that it would be harder to set up on Linux, I was wrong. SteamVR on Linux works fine. \n\nMy next test will be Fallout 4 VR. I‚Äôve heard the performance from other people‚Äôs tests is not good. It is a bit more demanding than Skyrim. I feel I can fix that with mods though and ini tweaks. It didn‚Äôt launch under windows though, it CTD. So let‚Äôs hope it runs as well and as easy as Skyrim did.\n\nWish me luck ",

Problem is that in order to trigger them, I'd have to boot up steam link or moonlight, start and end of every session, run them from the app list, close.\n\nWhat I'd ideally like is to have these two nestled away in my 'Game Streaming'  category, so they're just 2-3 taps away, and .sh files don't get bumped to the top of the home menu when used.",

This makes it really hard to enjoy that type of game and I essentially feel like I'm missing out by playing something like Indiana Jones on my deck instead of my 27\" 1440P monitor which is much more immersive.\n\nAt the same time, I find myself wanting to play more on the SD because after working 8 hours from home on my computer, sitting there and gaming another 4+ is getting old and it's affecting me because it becomes a room of depression if that makes sense. When I play cartoon games, 2d, platformers, etc. on deck it feels great and I wish I was able to game on the couch or even in bed where I have more windows/light, etc. just makes it feel better after spending all day working in a small dark room.\n\nAnyone else experience the same and find any solutions?",

However now it's incredibly sturrery and has continued that way for a few months now.\n\nI've looked online and this seems to be a recurring issue for alot of people since a recent patch. Is there any fixes for this? It makes Gyro unplayable for the most part.",

So I guess they have a warehouse full of these, and they're just shoveling them out.\n\nI'm now pushing Valve for an RMA (and I'll get an OLED, which supposedly works).\n\nWouldn't it be hilarious if the 2022 OS was not compatible with some 2025 change to Steam's download/update service?\n\nI'm a game dev, and I was planning to use this as a dev kit, which is why I got the cheaper one... but man, this has been the worst \"out of the box\" experience with a consumer device that I've ever had.\n\nIf I was a kid at Christmas, this would have been a terrible Christmas.",

    "selftext": "I've looked around and can't find a specific answer to this, but some bits of info that point to my Steam Deck damaging my 1.5tb Sandisk SD card. \n\n  \nSD card worked fine for a few months and then recently games just wouldn't load from the SD card. I had to reinstall them to get them working, which they did but the install took a while so I decided to reformat the SD card to get it working correctly. The formatting just didn't work, just sat there. Tried a few methods mentioned on some posts about formatting but wouldn't work. Formatted the card on my PC - quick format works find but full format again just doesnt do anything - sitting at 0% after 30 minutes. According to my PC the card is fine, no errors. After a quick format I used it on my PC and am installing Steam Games on there as it seems more reliable than the Steam Deck - but its taking a very long time to install - for context its taken over an hour to do 10gb of a 40gb install, where as installing on a different disk took about 10 mins for 10gb. \n\n  \nI know this is a crossover into general tech support, but I've seen a few people mention SD card problems so wondering it might be an issues with the Steam Deck and if there anyway to fix the card?\n\n  \nThanks",

    "selftext": "Howdy,\n\nI have had my Steam Deck for a little over a year and it's great. I have been using a wired Xbox Series controller, it's a cheap Power A controller and honestly, it feels good, gives me no trouble and always works. However, it being wired is a pain in the ass. \n\nI have bought a longer usb c cable that goes from my dock all the way to my gaming chair. Now, this is a prime example of first world problems, but the cable is annoying as hell. I tried to get as flexible a cable as I could, but it is just a mess when I have it stored behind my Steam Deck.\n\nLooking into using a wireless controller seems way more complicated than I thought it would be. Would a wireless Power A Xbox Series controller work ok? I have heard some people say that wireless controllers with the Steam Deck can disconnect and be awkward to use.\n\nThanks in advance for any help or suggestions. I am in the UK so if anyone can point me in the direction of something here that would be great. ",

When I plugged it in the LED flashed. I closed up the machine, plugged it into charge, and the LED lit up. \n\nPlayed for a couple hours with no issue. Saw the battery was at 90%. Put the screen to sleep and set it aside.\n\nNow, 5 hours later. I went to plug it in and the LED will not turn on.

Has anyone experienced this problem and what did you do to fix it?\n\nThank you ",

It's portable, but hardly pocketable, so I'm never really going to take it anywhere unless I'm properly traveling, and even then I have far more portable options. What that boils down to is that if a game is also available on Switch (or Switch 2 which I don't have yet), then I'd rather just get it there. I can also use that on the couch and it's way easier to take with me. My Switch Lite fits in my pocket. \n\nIf a game isn't also available on another portable console, then I also have a PC and an Xbox at home, and I know that not everyone has all that, but I can play a lot of those games also on the couch on a big TV with a nice controller. That's not to mention that a lot of my steam library are games that either don't have controller support or are better with keyboard and mouse.\n\nWhat am I actually supposed to play on the Steam Deck that isn't a better experience on a different device? It's too big to be portable, and it struggles to compete with other options in the house. We originally only got one because my son was interested in it, and he never touches it, he just uses his ipad. \n\nI want to want to use it, I just don't see the use case unless you don't own anything else, and in that case, that's not much of an endorsement to \"just get a steam deck\". \n\nHelp me see the light.

I‚Äôm sure everyone has heard this story a thousand times. The battery completely died and now I just have a black screen with the console running properly but screen is black. \n\nIt‚Äôs crazy how this is just a normal thing, I‚Äôm assuming there is still no solutions to this. I have tried just about everything. And now this is my second time going through this. Steam deck is my favorite thing ever but I definitely can‚Äôt justify buying a 3rd one for this to just happen again after a year. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated. ",

    "title": "Skyrim VR works nearly perfectly on SteamOS",
    "selftext": "So I previously had a dual boot setup with windows but after it wiped my SteamOS partition during an update, it got wiped itself. Windows is not a viable way to play games unless you tinker and completely disable updates. SteamOS can do 95 percent of things except anti cheat. \n\nAnyway\nSo my previous thread I ran Fallout New Vegas through vorpx on windows and it ran pretty well but after wiping windows I still had the VR itch. \n\nSo I found ALVR works under steam OS so I thought I‚Äôd give it a test, and to my surprise it worked really well with almost no advanced tinkering. \n\nI went to desktop, installed ALVR then SteamVR. Installed the Firewall rules and still had ALVR on my quest 1. \nTried aircarVR as a test and got amazingly smooth performance, much better than I got under Windows, so I got adventurous and tried Skyrim VR.\n\nNow I‚Äôd previously tried to run SkyrimVR under windows and it simply would not work. It would CTD on launch and never worked. I read up some people had got it working but the amount of work was just ridiculous and not worth it. Everyone kept claiming the performance will be awful and unplayable. Well I‚Äôm here to quash that myth. It works amazingly well without mods and completely vanilla. A great start if you just want to play it as is. \n\nIt started up right away, no crashes and straight into the starting room. I loaded my save at whiterun and it performed great. I had a bit of slow down when loading in but other than that, smooth as butter. If you‚Äôre looking for a vanilla experience, I can say it works perfectly. I didn‚Äôt even change the performance preset from medium. If you encounter slowdown, then bumping that down would make it even better.\nIt looked a bit blurry but still completely playable, the blur can be fixed with mods and settings tweaks anyway but I didn‚Äôt do it. \n\nSo if you want to play Skyrim VR, it works on the deck. \nSome quick pointers to finish, \n\nIf you get a black screen with ALVR then you need to add the launch command on the GitHub. You need to add it to run ALVR no exceptions. \n\nMake sure you don‚Äôt suffocate your deck when you VR game, you‚Äôll end up with bad performance throttling and a melted console. Keep it ventilated and performance will remain stable. \n\nI lowered my resolution to match my Quest 1 within steamVR, so if you get performance issues, try lowering yours.\n\nI tried running ALVR in gaming mode but it had a black screen, I didn‚Äôt tinker further but that might be fixable. For now keep the deck in desktop mode for VR\n\nDon‚Äôt bother with windows for just VR. It‚Äôs more hassle than just using SteamOS. I originally dual booted for VR thinking that it would be harder to set up on Linux, I was wrong. SteamVR on Linux works fine. \n\nMy next test will be Fallout 4 VR. I‚Äôve heard the performance from other people‚Äôs tests is not good. It is a bit more demanding than Skyrim. I feel I can fix that with mods though and ini tweaks. It didn‚Äôt launch under windows though, it CTD. So let‚Äôs hope it runs as well and as easy as Skyrim did.\n\nWish me luck ",

A lot of PC players are used to play without a gamepad and we didn‚Äôt fully realize that.\n\nWe‚Äôre currently working on keyboard & mouse controls, and it works fine. So you can still play our upcoming game on PC, but it would feel way better on Steamdeck:\n\n* Controls are tailored to play smoothly on a pad and to make full use of all the Steamdeck buttons,\n* UI is designed to be readable on a small screen,\n* There‚Äôs a quick game mode, you decide how long you want it to be,\n* If you feel peaceful, you can be friends with other factions,\n* You can do some actions, then pause the game and continue later,\n* Characters are so cute that you want to keep them in your pocket üíô\n\nThe game is perfect to be played on-the-go.  \nWe hope Steamdeck users will enjoy our alien game üòÖ\n\nNB: Sorry the poor video and sound quality!",

Every game I played is buttery smooth and the touchpads... my oh my the touchpads are wonderful when its time to use the desktop! I also love the dpad (and im not a dpad person, i used to play silksong with my dualsense's joystick), and the short travel distance of the triggers is perfect!\n\nNow, I only have one issue... and it might be a bug, but when im in desktop mode and I use the touchpads to control the mouse, I can let the mouse slide if I bring my thumb to the side of the pad, but it only works to go left. Whenever I try to make it go right, it never slides! Maybe its a design choice, but if it is its not a good one! (In my opinion)\n\nAny ways to fix this? I love this thing so much but sometimes i actually need to slide the cursor and it wont do it...",

Unfortunately, when trying to pair them, the steam deck shows connected but the Xbox controller just stays in pairing mode and the icon on the controller continues to blink. \n\nAfter doing some research I found that the Xbox controller might need a firmware update. I tried using a usb c to usb c to connect the controller to the laptop. Unfortunately, the pc wasn‚Äôt recognizing the controller when connected to the usb c cord. I was reading that it might be because most phone charger cords are charge only and not charge and data cords? (This was a cell charger usb c)\n\nWould a standard USB B to USB C cord solve my issue? Or if there is a specific one I can purchase, would someone be able to share a link? Thanks a bunch. I‚Äôm not super tech savvy so I‚Äôm trying my best here. Thanks all for your help!",

I‚Äôve had my LCD 512GB Deck for about three years now (I upgraded the SSD to 2TB over a year ago, I don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with my issues)\n\nBasically, the Deck is constantly freezing and locking up mid-game lately. Sometimes the system will fully reboot itself when I‚Äôm in the middle of a game, sometimes it‚Äôll simply freeze with the game hanging and none of the controls responding, forcing me to hold the power button to to force it off. Occasionally when this happens I also get the audio glitching and repeating, sort of like when you‚Äôd accidentally knock a CD player back in the day.\n\nI‚Äôve had my performance metrics on lately to see if there is any kind of overheating happening but it doesn‚Äôt appear so. Lately I‚Äôve been playing Hades 2 and Megabonk, both of which have frozen and crashed the Deck multiple times but I wouldn‚Äôt consider them hyper taxing games. I‚Äôve also had this issue while emulating old games.\n\nFrom Googling around for solutions I have tried switching from the Beta OS channel to the Stable, and back again. It hasn‚Äôt made any difference. Seems like the only other recommended option I‚Äôve seen online is doing a factory reset, which I would hate to do but if that‚Äôs what it takes, I‚Äôll do it. I have Decky installed and Cryoutilities. I‚Äôve had both for years. \n\nWondering if anyone here has any ideas. Thank you!\n",

    "selftext": "So I previously had a dual boot setup with windows but after it wiped my SteamOS partition during an update, it got wiped itself. Windows is not a viable way to play games unless you tinker and completely disable updates. SteamOS can do 95 percent of things except anti cheat. \n\nAnyway\nSo my previous thread I ran Fallout New Vegas through vorpx on windows and it ran pretty well but after wiping windows I still had the VR itch. \n\nSo I found ALVR works under steam OS so I thought I‚Äôd give it a test, and to my surprise it worked really well with almost no advanced tinkering. \n\nI went to desktop, installed ALVR then SteamVR. Installed the Firewall rules and still had ALVR on my quest 1. \nTried aircarVR as a test and got amazingly smooth performance, much better than I got under Windows, so I got adventurous and tried Skyrim VR.\n\nNow I‚Äôd previously tried to run SkyrimVR under windows and it simply would not work. It would CTD on launch and never worked. I read up some people had got it working but the amount of work was just ridiculous and not worth it. Everyone kept claiming the performance will be awful and unplayable. Well I‚Äôm here to quash that myth. It works amazingly well without mods and completely vanilla. A great start if you just want to play it as is. \n\nIt started up right away, no crashes and straight into the starting room. I loaded my save at whiterun and it performed great. I had a bit of slow down when loading in but other than that, smooth as butter. If you‚Äôre looking for a vanilla experience, I can say it works perfectly. I didn‚Äôt even change the performance preset from medium. If you encounter slowdown, then bumping that down would make it even better.\nIt looked a bit blurry but still completely playable, the blur can be fixed with mods and settings tweaks anyway but I didn‚Äôt do it. \n\nSo if you want to play Skyrim VR, it works on the deck. \nSome quick pointers to finish, \n\nIf you get a black screen with ALVR then you need to add the launch command on the GitHub. You need to add it to run ALVR no exceptions. \n\nMake sure you don‚Äôt suffocate your deck when you VR game, you‚Äôll end up with bad performance throttling and a melted console. Keep it ventilated and performance will remain stable. \n\nI lowered my resolution to match my Quest 1 within steamVR, so if you get performance issues, try lowering yours.\n\nI tried running ALVR in gaming mode but it had a black screen, I didn‚Äôt tinker further but that might be fixable. For now keep the deck in desktop mode for VR\n\nDon‚Äôt bother with windows for just VR. It‚Äôs more hassle than just using SteamOS. I originally dual booted for VR thinking that it would be harder to set up on Linux, I was wrong. SteamVR on Linux works fine. \n\nMy next test will be Fallout 4 VR. I‚Äôve heard the performance from other people‚Äôs tests is not good. It is a bit more demanding than Skyrim. I feel I can fix that with mods though and ini tweaks. It didn‚Äôt launch under windows though, it CTD. So let‚Äôs hope it runs as well and as easy as Skyrim did.\n\nWish me luck ",

This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5).

Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

I'm considering buying one secondhand, anyone got one handy and wants to sell at a reasonable price?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, we are working on something and I'd like to know your honest opinion, sort of a sense-check.\n\nIt's a tool (or rather a suite of tools) that guides you step by step through the process of building and maintaining a smart home. A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe‚Äôre still in development and not selling anything yet ‚Äî just trying to see if there‚Äôs real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

I'm also getting some home security stuff (free through my internet provider), but being able to connect all that stuff together or having all the devices stuff connected to my phone & the Alexa would be so helpful and maybe help me understand some of it a bit better. I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'd be tearing my hair out if I had any left.  Thank you in advance.",

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob ü§∑\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on¬†https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup?

    "title": "Reverse-engineering DPS 101 on LEDVANCE Tuya RGBIC lamp - unknown LED indices cause device reboot",
    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0‚Äì360, S and V are 0‚Äì1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01‚Ä¶81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests ‚Äúindex‚Äù is the zero-based LED position inside the device‚Äôs internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` ‚Üí hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 ‚Ä¶` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the ‚Äúapply‚Äù byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 ‚Ä¶`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n‚Ä¢ Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n‚Ä¢ Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n‚Ä¢ Working zone writes: `‚Ä¶ 81 01` to `‚Ä¶ 81 04`  \n‚Ä¢ Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n‚Ä¢ Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n‚Ä¢ Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5).

Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

The key thing I want is to be able to vary the water temp because this let's you save a lot of money potentially. \n\nUnfortunately regulation in the UK means anything I do to a boiler must be done by a lazy, busy, boring gas engineer. So I probably can't say \"just put this arduino in here and leave this cable\".\n\nHad a bit of a session with gemini. It suggested tado thermostats, but these don't let your vary water temp. \n\nDoes anyone know of the most \"open\" smart boiler interface.\n\n\n# Progress\n\nAn LLM says that the opentherm protocol is not designed to give me control over the water temp but that some allow the use ti set a max and a min water temp. It suggests the\n\nElektrobock BT57 and the DIYLESS Opentherm thermostat",

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe‚Äôre still in development and not selling anything yet ‚Äî just trying to see if there‚Äôs real value in this idea.

    "title": "Smart Curtain Motor help? Motor specs or modificaitons for 16/2 Low-Voltage Power cable?",
    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

Would anyone have any suggestions on products that might achieve this? If need be I would certainly set up a Home Assistant server to accommodate this project. I set up a home assistant server a few years ago but couldn't quite justify keeping it in place as I didn't have the need at the time. But this would push me over this threshold should it be necessary. Thanks for your guidance!\n\nPs this would also work great in a residential bathroom: occupancy sensors and bathrooms are great except when it's the middle of the night!",

I like to sleep cold, but enjoy getting up with a moderately warm room. \n\nI already have a fan that turns off about 30 minutes to an hour before I wake up, which is nice. The thing I'm looking for is a way for my door to be closed as well. (I don't have a window, the door leads to a small balcony). I noticed there are a number of products that allow for automation when it comes to allowing pets through or manual opening and closing, but none that include a timer. Am I just being blind and missing them or do they not exist? \n\nIf anyone has a solution, I would love to hear it! (Sleeping in a warm room is not an option)",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5). Tripp Lite Metered PDU, 15A, 13 Outlets (5-15R), 120V, 5-15P, 100-127V Input, 15 ft. Cord, 1U Rack-Mount Power, (PDUMH15)\n\n6). NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "Hi, I need some advice please.  I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

Not after battery changes, just randomly. Over time one of my indoor sensors has become completely undetectable.\n\nI'm looking to upgrade but honestly I'm not very impressed with my Grovee experience. Maybe I just bought the wrong model? There seem to be so many different options of Grovee set ups, some of which have been talked about here but I'm afraid of a repeat performance from a new Grovee set up. Is there a better option out there? What have you been using and for how long?\n\nMy Desires:\n\n- Amazon Alexa (I would like to be able to link to Alexa so I can ask temp/humidity of certain sensors)\n- Android Widget Option\n- Less than $200 for set up (5 sensors preferred)",

All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

Now, Google wants nearly ¬£300 for renewal  and it‚Äôs being rebranded as Google Home Premium Advanced.\n\nThat price jump feels insane for what I‚Äôm getting.\n\nI‚Äôve recently moved all my automations to Home Assistant and absolutely love it. It‚Äôs made me realize how much control I could have outside Google‚Äôs ecosystem.\n\nSo, my question:\nWhat‚Äôs the best way to move away from Google/Nest entirely while keeping similar functionality (especially for cameras and hubs)?\n\nIs there a good local/NAS-based alternative for video storage and smart home integration?\n\nAnyone here migrated from Nest to Home Assistant-compatible cameras successfully?\n\nAnd what‚Äôs the best use for the Nest Hubs if I start de-Googling everything?\n\n\nAppreciate any tips or migration stories from folks who‚Äôve done this , I‚Äôm happy to tinker, but I don‚Äôt want to lose reliability or ease of use for the family.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I‚Äôve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox ‚Äî mostly because it supports Matter and doesn‚Äôt need a separate hub.\n\nHere‚Äôs my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn‚Äôt connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz ‚Äî after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It‚Äôs surprisingly consistent ‚Äî every morning when I‚Äôm still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a ‚ÄúMovie mode‚Äù scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they‚Äôre showing around 85%. I‚Äôll update if that changes, but it looks like they‚Äôll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly ‚Äî not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went ‚Äúno response‚Äù üòÖ.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding ‚Äî but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt‚Äôs not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected ‚Äî thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn‚Äôt super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn‚Äôt bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that‚Äôs fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything ‚Äî I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn‚Äôt drop connection every other day.\nIf you‚Äôre building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I‚Äôll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

    "selftext": "I have a smart IR blaster which is connected to the wifi so I can connect it to my phone. The built in on and off and other basic commands like temperature work fine. But when I tried to use the DIY function where I physically put the remote up to the IR blaster so it can read the signal outputted by the remote so that it can read that signal and out put it itself, it doesn't work but when I tried the remote on the ac itself it does work. AC doesnt support a wifi function so it won't work with the TCL home app. The Smart IR blaster is an OEM tuya remote. \n\nI first tried to consult this to an AI model but it said that remotes often transmit a long code containing temperature, modes and whatnot and that the IR receiver of the blaster might not be picking that long code and only picking up a quick bit of it. Then it just said to bring this up to a community so here I am. I think my problem might not be with TCL but that I'm trying to use an AC",

Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I‚Äôve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a better alternative.\n\n**What I‚Äôm looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4‚Äì5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you‚Äôve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn‚Äôt a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance ‚Äî and if you‚Äôve built something like this, I‚Äôd love to see your setup!",

I don't want a voice activated system like Alexa or Google Home. Something more simple. What are your suggestions? I'm not trying to create some massive home network here.    \nOverthinking here!  ",

(Some things are more comokicated but with enough time i can handle it) So i would love to have the visualisation over HA. \n\nBUT; What would be the best/easiest way to set up the rest/electricity? This should be more of an easy/straight forward thing. Should run when we move into the house. I can set the HA things later. \n\nI Thought KNX would be the way, but there are still a few disadvantages:\n\n- I cant program ETS by myself\n- I would like to have the main functions to work with KNX (heating, shading, lights, main door lock, garage door) to be controled over switches AND something like a Shelly walldisplay which should have all functions.\n\nSo my questions is:\n-Is it possible to control shading, main door lock etc. also over HA? (Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system. (Where I can do the normal stuff already when moving into the house)\n\nThanks for your advice!\n",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

Is there a way to increase the reliability of this automation?  I have plenty of windows, a cat and its a big open area.  Whether it be a better product or the FP2 in combination with another sensor?  Would really enjoy a cool working situation with automatic lights when you step in a zone.\n\n**Right now:**  \n**If you walk in the livingroom area, kitchen or sitting area, lights go on in their respective locations.**\n\n**(after a while i added this one since on and off when you walk back and forth is annoying)**  \n**The lights turn off after 5 min of no activity**",

    "selftext": "Hi, I need some advice please.  I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

Not after battery changes, just randomly. Over time one of my indoor sensors has become completely undetectable.\n\nI'm looking to upgrade but honestly I'm not very impressed with my Grovee experience. Maybe I just bought the wrong model? There seem to be so many different options of Grovee set ups, some of which have been talked about here but I'm afraid of a repeat performance from a new Grovee set up. Is there a better option out there? What have you been using and for how long?\n\nMy Desires:\n\n- Amazon Alexa (I would like to be able to link to Alexa so I can ask temp/humidity of certain sensors)\n- Android Widget Option\n- Less than $200 for set up (5 sensors preferred)",

All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "title": "Been testing Bringnox smart shades with HomeKit for 3 weeks ‚Äî here‚Äôs what I learned",
    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I‚Äôve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox ‚Äî mostly because it supports Matter and doesn‚Äôt need a separate hub.\n\nHere‚Äôs my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn‚Äôt connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz ‚Äî after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It‚Äôs surprisingly consistent ‚Äî every morning when I‚Äôm still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a ‚ÄúMovie mode‚Äù scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they‚Äôre showing around 85%. I‚Äôll update if that changes, but it looks like they‚Äôll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly ‚Äî not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went ‚Äúno response‚Äù üòÖ.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding ‚Äî but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt‚Äôs not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected ‚Äî thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn‚Äôt super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn‚Äôt bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that‚Äôs fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything ‚Äî I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn‚Äôt drop connection every other day.\nIf you‚Äôre building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I‚Äôll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.

There‚Äôs also a $50 bill credit for using a referral code during signup.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to do it right away either ‚Äî you can activate the Vivint part anytime after you‚Äôre enrolled through their app or website.\n\nBoth devices work with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can do voice control for temperature, doorbell notifications, etc. No HomeKit yet, unfortunately.\n\nIf anyone wants the exact page or referral code that makes the $50 credit work, I can drop it in the comments.\n\nyou can also type LTMXR2K on Reliant Energy's site during signup for the $50 credit.  You can get the Vivint smarthome hardware and install with or without the code.",

    "selftext": "I have had my two home office PCs hooked up to a GREATHTEK KVM switch for a couple years and everything has working flawlessly. I have one monitor, one keyboard and one mouse. Today, after not accessing the 2nd PC for a few days, when I switched to it, the keyboard and mouse didn't work - but only for the 2nd PC. The first PC was fine. The 2nd PC displayed the lock screen but was otherwise completely non-responsive. I checked all the connections - plugging/unplugging/dusting/vacuuming, etc. - but no joy. I then unplugged the keyboard and mouse from the KVM and plugged them directly into the 2nd PC. Everthing worked. Plugging the keyboard and mouse back into the KVM, the 2nd PC still did not respond. I'm guessing that something in the KVM switch related to outputs to the 2nd PC has failed. Anyone else ever experienced this or have any advice? Thanks in advance for any insights. ",

So i tried Msi's Control Center app and it works but i don't get this one thing. Once i set the rgb off and uninstall the software it stays off for a time but after several days i see that the rgb is back on again.\n\nSo in order to disable them all the time, i didn't uninstall the app and it successfully disables them after boot.\n\nWhat is the reason for them staying off a few days after uninstalling the application?\n\nI bet it should trigger some setting on bios or something to make it permanent but why it resets itself, i don't get it.",

    "selftext": "Context: \n\nI first started experiencing the disconnects in April or May. It‚Äôs been several months and nothing I‚Äôve tried has helped so I kind of gave up trying to find a solution for some time but I‚Äôm back to wanting to find a fix. \n\nI vaguely recall trying pingplotter a few months back to see what was causing the issue and I remember concluding that the router (or isp?) was the issue. \n\nMy brother claims he never disconnects on his phone but when we played a pc game together  2ish months ago he disconnected and I didn‚Äôt. So, it‚Äôs apparent not every device is disconnecting at the same time. \n\nThen there‚Äôs the issue of my wifi turning off while I watch streams. I know the wifi is turning off because I get a pop up on my iphone asking if I want to turn on my mobile data due to the wifi not being on.\n\nThe mobile disconnects only seem to happen to me at night, if I recall correctly. The pc disconnects on the other hand, seems to happen anytime from noon-night from what I‚Äôve noticed. \n\nQuestion: \n\nWhat are some methods I can attempt using to fix my connection issues that seem to be caused by my router? \n\nThe router I currently have is ISP provided (Fizz, I‚Äôm based in Quebec). We‚Äôve had the router for 3-4 years. Everything has been working well up until April/May. It‚Äôs been a good 6 months of me dealing with this issue now. \n\n\nI would appreciate any insight or advice you can provide me with. Thank you. \n\nEdit: Wanted to add that after disconnecting I reconnect within 5-10 seconds on mobile. On pc I get kicked from my games. ",

I bought it from Cex and they were great and refunded a decent amount with no dramas so it felt right to get my next phone from them. \nSo i bought an iphone 16 pro. I received the first one scratched across the screen which was annoying and when setting up the phone it automatically made an ESim. The phone was very slow with connection to the internet regardless of if wifi or mobile data. \nI went to an O2 shop, they transferred me to a new physical sim but this didnt improve anything. \nSo i returned this and got a second one. \nThe set up of the second one was fine, no dramas apart from it didnt carry any of my internet tabs over. This phone is now connecting via wifi but the mobile data is so slow it cant load websites, oddly it can manage to load instagram, facebook and whatsapp but slowly. \n\nToday i went back to the O2 shop, they transferred to ANOTHER new sim card but no improvement noted. \n\nI have swapped this sim into a friend‚Äôs phone who is on sky and mobile data works just fine. \n\nWhat do i now do? \nCex is saying the phone isnt faulty, O2 is saying its not an issue their end. \n\nIt might be worth adding but iphone 16pros are running the new ‚Äúliquid glass‚Äù update as apple doesnt give you a choice when setting up a new phone. \n\nThankyou \nI‚Äôm really stumped what to do :) ",

I think my keyboard and my headset are kinda old now and they get kinda yellow-y which sucks. Also my keyboard does not function that well anymore.\n\nHOWEVER! I want to upgrade. Namely Keyboard, Headphones and (if needed!) a seperate microphone with an arm.\n\nMy favorites thus far might be (and most likely because of Corsair K65 Plus Wireless (Keyboard); SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P Wireless Gen 2 (Headphone). I have to admit, this was mostly because of the looks, which is why I ask for your experience and recommendations :D\n\nI am especially very unfamilar with seperate microphones and have no idea on what to search for. As for the usecase: Daily PC use for casual gaming and some programming lol.\n\nI am grateful for any input and if we can save some munny along the way I would be happy too :3\n\nBytheway, if its somewhat important, I live in austria so currency would be ‚Ç¨.\n\nThanks in advance <3",

This is my backup or spare iphone.  I like this phone because of how small it is.\n\nBattery health is like 70% but basically not usuable.  It shows 100% battery when full but then goes to 70% and 50% and shuts off.  The last time I replaced this battery was many years ago at apple.  Then after a bit, battery went really bad.  So I have rarely used this iphone much anymore.\n\nI know apple doesn't do replacement battery for it.  I cannot do DIY with opening a phone and replacing the battery I don't believe.  Is ifixit the best site for this?  Battery is 25 or 30 dollar depending on if you want the tools.  Shipping is 10 dollars.  So it's like 40 or 50 dollars total with tax.  A repair shop will charge probably 30 to 50 dollars to do the battery replacement?  So this would cost more than a used iphone se on ebay?  I think it's around 65 dollars for one on ebay.  I want to use my old iphone SE.  What is the best option for this?  Buy a battery on amazon or ebay from a good seller?  Still I have to bring it to repair shop right?  I don't want to try to replace battery myself and mess up the phone.  Does it make sense to just buy a used iphone SE instead if I want to stick with apple?  I want a backup smartphone as my 2nd phone and prefer it to be apple.  An android smartphone still cost 100 dollars right new?",

I can add the first and third weekends with no problem. When I try to add the 5th weekend, the only option I get is to recur on the \"last Friday of the month.\" The problem with this is that most months, the \"last\" Friday is the 4th Friday of the month and I wouldn't actually have my kids. If you want to try it yourself, you can use Oct 31, 2025.\n\n  \nOther than manually adding the 5th weekend in the appropriate months, is there a way to set a recurring appointment for the 5th Friday of the month? Thanks for any help!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone.\n\nI went from windows 10 to windows 11 yesterday, and since then I have a micro freeze every second. And when I draw on my tablet (xp-pen) it is extremely problematic and annoying. Basically, I can't really work anymore because of this. I've tried making some space on my SSD (I am around 100Gb of free space) and updating my drivers but absolutely nothing changed. If anything it became even worse.\n\nThe freezes only occurs IN softwares (from what I've seen), so like, if I move around the document window, it won't freeze like my drawing freezes when I move it (I wanted to link a video to my post to show the issue but I can't). Strangely enough, when I move my pencil above my tablet, if I have a brush equiped, the brush freezes every second to its current location for a very short time, but when I do the same thing with the zoom tool it does not freeze (I am using neither of the tools, just moving the cursor, and the result is the same with the pen and the mouse). \n\nWhen I move the view in Pureref, it freezes all the same, but only in folders that contains a certain number of image references. If the number is low, the freeze does not occur. So I guess it has to do with memory/vRAM, but I know so little about tech, this is why I am here, if you have any advice for me about what I should do, this would be very helpful.\n\nThanks in advance. \n\nLittle note : The freeze also occurs on my main screen if I move clip studio paint or pureref on it, it doesn't simply happen on my tablet. And it does not appear to be random freezes, it's pretty much coming back at a precise timing every time.",

Anyway, there are three things that are off, and one of them is really annoying:\n\n  \n1. Occassionally while charging my laptop gets incredibly slow. This is fixed immediately whenever I unplug my charger. However it goes so slow it's almost unusable and this is the biggest issue for me\n\n2. The charger sometimes goes through this cycle where it stays plugged in, but my laptop flashes on and off between charging and not charging. This is annoying because whenever my laptop goes from charging to not charging, the screen goes black for a second and it changes its \"mode\" to charging (It's an ROG and it has all kinds of different performance settings, i don't know how to turn off it changing performance settings between charging and not). \n\n3. The metal bit that goes into my laptop gets VERY VERY hot. this doesn't bother me, but it sounds like it could be useful to diagnose the issue\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated",

Once i set the rgb off and uninstall the software it stays off for a time but after several days i see that the rgb is back on again.\n\nSo in order to disable them all the time, i didn't uninstall the app and it successfully disables them after boot.\n\nWhat is the reason for them staying off a few days after uninstalling the application?\n\nI bet it should trigger some setting on bios or something to make it permanent but why it resets itself, i don't get it.",

    "selftext": "Context: \n\nI first started experiencing the disconnects in April or May. It‚Äôs been several months and nothing I‚Äôve tried has helped so I kind of gave up trying to find a solution for some time but I‚Äôm back to wanting to find a fix. \n\nI vaguely recall trying pingplotter a few months back to see what was causing the issue and I remember concluding that the router (or isp?) was the issue. \n\nMy brother claims he never disconnects on his phone but when we played a pc game together  2ish months ago he disconnected and I didn‚Äôt. So, it‚Äôs apparent not every device is disconnecting at the same time. \n\nThen there‚Äôs the issue of my wifi turning off while I watch streams. I know the wifi is turning off because I get a pop up on my iphone asking if I want to turn on my mobile data due to the wifi not being on.\n\nThe mobile disconnects only seem to happen to me at night, if I recall correctly. The pc disconnects on the other hand, seems to happen anytime from noon-night from what I‚Äôve noticed. \n\nQuestion: \n\nWhat are some methods I can attempt using to fix my connection issues that seem to be caused by my router? \n\nThe router I currently have is ISP provided (Fizz, I‚Äôm based in Quebec). We‚Äôve had the router for 3-4 years. Everything has been working well up until April/May. It‚Äôs been a good 6 months of me dealing with this issue now. \n\n\nI would appreciate any insight or advice you can provide me with. Thank you. \n\nEdit: Wanted to add that after disconnecting I reconnect within 5-10 seconds on mobile. On pc I get kicked from my games. ",

On the bright side, been a couple years since the last fresh install and windows login time was broken at some point in the last year and taking 5+ minutes which is no longer happening.  Appreciate all the tips and advice.**  \n  \nWindows 11 23h2, Ryzen 9 5900x, Asus Prime B550-PLUS AC/HES, Samsung NVMEs with latest firmware, 4070 ti super graphics card.\n\nSome months back my machine auto updated to 24h2, which I had to roll back due to audio and graphic issues.\n\nFast forward to today, I see that 23h2 is EOL next month but 24h2 isn't showing available.  Apparently the rollback created some sort of local group policy or registry setting I had to undo to make 24h2 appear in Windows update.\n\nAfter the lengthy download/install process and multiple reboots, it gets to 85% and then reboots once more only to display \"undoing changes made to your computer\" and once I'm logged back in and view windows updates, it says 24h2 install failed 0x8007001f.\n\nI went deep down the rabbit hole with sfc and dism commands, deleting the \\\\SoftwareDistribution\\\\ folder, etc.   3 times now it's gone through the full 24h2 download/install process only to revert the changes.  I even tried using the install assistant download from MS, which would have done 25h2, same result, ends with reverting changes.  Just checked Windows Update, showed 25h2, tried to download and install that, immediately failed with error 0x80246019.  Refreshed Windows Update, now just shows 25h2 Completed...when I know it's not.\n\nI'm at a complete loss on this.  I have no idea why 24h2 and 25h2 won't install, nothing is indicating any issues with my machine.  I'm starting to think it might be something installed on my system, like Malwarebytes?",

I bought it from Cex and they were great and refunded a decent amount with no dramas so it felt right to get my next phone from them. \nSo i bought an iphone 16 pro. I received the first one scratched across the screen which was annoying and when setting up the phone it automatically made an ESim. The phone was very slow with connection to the internet regardless of if wifi or mobile data. \nI went to an O2 shop, they transferred me to a new physical sim but this didnt improve anything. \nSo i returned this and got a second one. \nThe set up of the second one was fine, no dramas apart from it didnt carry any of my internet tabs over. This phone is now connecting via wifi but the mobile data is so slow it cant load websites, oddly it can manage to load instagram, facebook and whatsapp but slowly. \n\nToday i went back to the O2 shop, they transferred to ANOTHER new sim card but no improvement noted. \n\nI have swapped this sim into a friend‚Äôs phone who is on sky and mobile data works just fine. \n\nWhat do i now do? \nCex is saying the phone isnt faulty, O2 is saying its not an issue their end. \n\nIt might be worth adding but iphone 16pros are running the new ‚Äúliquid glass‚Äù update as apple doesnt give you a choice when setting up a new phone. \n\nThankyou \nI‚Äôm really stumped what to do :) ",

I think my keyboard and my headset are kinda old now and they get kinda yellow-y which sucks. Also my keyboard does not function that well anymore.\n\nHOWEVER! I want to upgrade. Namely Keyboard, Headphones and (if needed!) a seperate microphone with an arm.\n\nMy favorites thus far might be (and most likely because of Corsair K65 Plus Wireless (Keyboard); SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P Wireless Gen 2 (Headphone). I have to admit, this was mostly because of the looks, which is why I ask for your experience and recommendations :D\n\nI am especially very unfamilar with seperate microphones and have no idea on what to search for. As for the usecase: Daily PC use for casual gaming and some programming lol.\n\nI am grateful for any input and if we can save some munny along the way I would be happy too :3\n\nBytheway, if its somewhat important, I live in austria so currency would be ‚Ç¨.\n\nThanks in advance <3",

Anyway, there are three things that are off, and one of them is really annoying:\n\n  \n1. Occassionally while charging my laptop gets incredibly slow. This is fixed immediately whenever I unplug my charger. However it goes so slow it's almost unusable and this is the biggest issue for me\n\n2. The charger sometimes goes through this cycle where it stays plugged in, but my laptop flashes on and off between charging and not charging. This is annoying because whenever my laptop goes from charging to not charging, the screen goes black for a second and it changes its \"mode\" to charging (It's an ROG and it has all kinds of different performance settings, i don't know how to turn off it changing performance settings between charging and not). \n\n3. The metal bit that goes into my laptop gets VERY VERY hot. this doesn't bother me, but it sounds like it could be useful to diagnose the issue\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated",

It‚Äôs been a good 6 months of me dealing with this issue now. \n\n\nI would appreciate any insight or advice you can provide me with.

    "selftext": "  \n**Sorry if this is long,** but I‚Äôve tried to be as detailed as possible since the issue is driving me crazy.   \n  \n**System specs:**\n\n* **CPU:** Intel Core i7-14700K\n* **GPU:** MSI RTX 3070 8 GB\n* **RAM:** 2√ó16 GB Crucial DDR5-4800 MHz (XMP off)\n* **Motherboard:** Gigabyte B760M D3HP (BIOS F8)\n* **PSU:** XPG Core Reactor 850 W (80+ Gold)\n* **Storage:** 500 GB Crucial NVMe M.2 SSD + 2√ó SATA SSD 500 GB\n* **OS:** Windows 11 \n\n\n\n**The issue:**\n\nFor about two weeks I‚Äôve been getting **hard freezes** (no blue screen, no error message, all peripherals shut off) that require a **manual restart**.  \nThey happen **only while playing online games**, specifically *Counter-Strike 2* and *Enshrouded*.\n\nWhat‚Äôs strange:\n\n* Never happens in single-player titles (*Cyberpunk 2077*, etc.)\n* Never in heavy workloads (*Premiere Pro*, *After Effects*, stress tests, etc.)\n* Temps and voltages always normal (HWMonitor confirms).\n\nIn *Event Viewer*, there‚Äôs **nothing at the exact crash time**, but always a **WHEA Logger Event ID 1** a minute or two after reboot.  \nNo BSODs, no dump files.\n\n  \n\n\n**What I‚Äôve tried so far:**\n\n* ‚úÖ Full clean reinstall (W11)\n* ‚úÖ Updated BIOS (F7 ‚Üí F8) and all Gigabyte drivers (chipset, ME, LAN, audio, etc.)\n* ‚úÖ GPU drivers DDU-cleaned and reinstalled (latest WHQL)\n* ‚úÖ Disabled Windows Game Bar, Core Isolation, Hyper-V, virtualization features\n* ‚úÖ Disabled Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 / tested combinations with Turbo Boost Tech ON + MAX OFF\n* ‚úÖ Tried manual **undervolt** in BIOS (-0.05 V DVID offset)\n* ‚úÖ **Stress tested** CPU, GPU, PSU, RAM separately with **OCCT (CPU Large Data Set, Power), FurMark, Superposition, CPU-Z Bench** ‚Üí **No errors**\n* ‚úÖ Temperatures under 70 ¬∞C under load; no throttling.\n* ‚úÖ Tried with **one RAM stick at a time** (each slot, each module) ‚Üí freeze still occurs.\n* ‚úÖ Tried CS2 with **‚Äú-vulkan‚Äù launch parameter** and with/without ‚Äúprefer performance cores‚Äù ‚Üí no difference.\n* ‚úÖ XMP Profile disabled to rule out memory instability.\n\n  \n\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* All freezes are identical: full system hang ‚Üí screen stuck ‚Üí peripherals shut off ‚Üí after \\~5 sec PC reboots automatically.\n* No signs of PSU overcurrent or thermal shutdown.\n* WHEA event appears only after reboot, not at the exact time.\n* I **upgraded recently** from an **i7-9700 / DDR4-3200 / B360M board**, and with that setup I *never* had these issues ‚Äî same GPU and PSU.\n\n  \n\n\n**What I‚Äôm asking:**\n\nAt this point, after trying every software/BIOS-level fix I can think of,  \nI‚Äôd like to know:\n\n* Could this point to a **faulty CPU**, **motherboard**, or **RAM controller** issue (since it‚Äôs only in online games)?\n* Or could it still be a weird **power-delivery or transient-spike** behavior that stress tests don‚Äôt replicate?\n* Any advanced diagnostic steps I could take before sending the PC back for hardware inspection?\n\nAll hardware stress tests pass, but PC still hard-freezes only in online games with WHEA logs after reboot. Need advice on what hardware could cause this. ‚ô•\n\nAny ideas or similar experiences are very welcome.  \nThis has been driving me insane, so really thanks in advance for reading.\n\n",
