    "selftext": "I just feel like sometimes when I get something from Apple and it works like garbage right out of the box, there’s no way it’s a brand new device. \n\nI got an iPhone 13 Pro Max when it came out. Right out of the box, inside the store, it wouldn’t connect to WiFi, it wouldn’t connect to 5G or LTE and it had to be connected via Ethernet. That phone had problems right out of the box and when we asked if we could get another phone that didn’t need to be connected via Ethernet for set up (while my mom had her iPhone 13 Pro out of the box set up beautifully with no extra support needed, they refused). \n\nJust now I got an Apple Pencil. Brand new. Off the Apple Store App. Engraved. And it only HALF works. It can click stuff. That’s it. It will not draw. \n\nOn procreate, the eraser works, smudge and paint don’t. On ArtStudio pro, nothing works. And on the iOS notes app, it draws. It was als\n\nMy really cheap $30 off brand “Apple” pencil works beautiful for everything though. \n\nI’ve reset the iPad, the pencil (forget this device), I’ve swapped out the Apple Pencil tips (official ones, even the bootleg one has an official tip on it) and it doesn’t work. \n\nIt wasn’t closed all the way (the tip) and won’t close all the way. I’m going to take this pencil into the Apple Store and ask for one that’s actually new or a refund if they give me another busted pencil. \n\nI might as well have bought three bootleg pencils and I’d have saved money and wouldn’t have products that actually work. \n",

I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

Backmarket website still will give me $159 for trade in, so I'm considering buying from them. Getting it fixed would be more expensive than any of the replacement options as well. I have narrowed my decision to these (all 256gb, price after trade in, and excellent condition):\n\n**14 Pro: $344**  \n**16e: $354**  \n**15: $388**  \n**15 Pro: $507**\n\nI'm having a hard time thinking the 15 pro is really worth $119-$163 more than the others, and kind of want to just save the money. I don't really care about the camera much, I'm sure any of them will have a good enough camera for me. I do however really like the 120hz refresh rate and worry about losing it a bit, but I also imagine I'd quickly get used to not having it. Battery life is important, which is why I'm only looking at their \"excellent\" condition phones. Part of me is leaning to the 14 Pro again, but I'd also like to finally be on USB-C. I don't game on my phone at all. Just social media, youtube, communication. Is there anything I'm missing? Should I consider anything else if I'm okay with the $500 range?",

Because sometimes his phone blocks thinking his screen time has reached its limit, but he claims he hasn’t used it that much. I don’t think he can (or is using) any detours like deleting/reinstalling apps, but something seems to causing problems. Can’t really find a solution Google, so was hoping someone here knows anything? Picture is from yesterdays phone use. ",

But, it is a beautiful design, and the look & feel of the case holding the phone, is great, I love the case.\n\n[Spigen Ultra Hybrid T](https://www.spigen.com/products/iphone-17-series-case-ultra-hybrid-t-magfit?variant=44454258769967): Case looks very nice with the Silver phone, but the edges are sharp and uncomfortable to hold, they are not round. The buttons (with the exception of the Camera button) are the worst I have used. The sides are TPU, therefore they yellow over time. I had an issue with the case, contacted customer support, and in 2 days I had a brand new case in my hands, excellent service, for a case that cost less than $20.\n\n[dbrand Ghost Case 2.0](https://dbrand.com/shop/ghost/iphone-17-pro-max-clear-cases): Case looks very nice, probably one of the best designs available, I like the grip of the sides, buttons are amazing. The quality of the case is not up to the look and design of the case, multiple reports of peeling of in the back, close to the camera/flash holes. Then, when you try to engage customer support, things go completely south, slow to no response, just to get a case replaced via warranty, can take weeks to months.\n\n[Smartish Gripmunk](https://smartish.com/collections/size-iphone-17-pro-max/products/gripmunk-with-magsafe-slim-case-for-iphone-17-pro-max): Nice case, good grip on the sides, but the back is too soft and a fingerprint magnet, also, like the other open camera plateau cases, to me, personally, is too risky of getting damaged. I would say overall a very good case for a reasonable price.\n\n[Spigen Rugged Armor](https://www.spigen.com/products/iphone-17-series-case-rugged-armor-magfit?variant=44454200868911): Nice design, supper grippy all around, protection all around as well. At the beginning, I was worried about the Camera button being just a TPU cover, not being responsive or loosing functionality, but I was wrong, it is very good, no trade off, compared to better implementations of the camera button. The trade off is that you can't see the phone at all, is fully covered and protected, but I miss looking at the beautiful design of the silver 17PM.\n\n[Apple Clear Case](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mgfw4ll/a/iphone-17-pro-max-clear-case-with-magsafe?fnode=4db99315de047fbcadaab35a5ac87c3413a97f08bb214687f8ed409d27607a7673516719f73174237505f162de5f9b3d2e9d59b57d91cce4297c58d9e673f44113bc77192fc4fe777e11a19a4ebde350ba4942e146c86fec4af31593255d06a1): For the Silver 17PM this is probably the best looking case, the design and the quality of the case is the best, Apple made. The case is built with a quality that it will not scratch, and, it will not yellow, therefore it will always look clean and nice on the phone. I am not a fan of the open camera plateau, there is a risk of damage there, also I don't like the handling of the case, I mean it feels great on your hands, is round and supper soft, it is amazing the feeling, but, it is like handling a wet piece of soap, super slippery, therefore the probability of falling is high. Also, at least to me, the case is really hard to remove.\n\nAs you can see every case has pros and cons, I have not mentioned price, because all of them are in the range of $30 - $60 USD, that it is within my budget, so it is not a variable to consider to me, now, which case do you think I finally decided to keep?",

The objective here is, we’d like to do a quick freeze frame in her videos and then insert an arrow or some kind of graphical identifier that points to my daughter to let viewers know where she is so they know what to focus on before the remainder of the footage plays out.\n\nIs there an app that can fulfill this objective? We don’t need any major bells or whistles—just something that can do what I’m asking above. Any guidance is greatly appreciated.",

I just want to avoid having it slide out of my hands. It’s basically the only reason I’m using a (slim) case.\n\nAre there any skins/stick on stickers that provide the same? Do do get gross after a while? Do they need to be replaced regularly? (Meaning I better get a pack of them straight away). Difficult to apply?

Or will they disappear once I stop paying for iCloud?\n\nTL;DR: I don’t care about a backup, just want to use iCloud once to sync all photos.

I’ve had this phone since launch and never really had problems. However just this evening noticed a very strange issue. \n\nEssentially the screen started looking “blurry” or “grainy” the closest thing I can describe it as is when you zoom into a photo and see kind of that gritty texture, but now it’s on everything. It’s not “in your face” kind of problem but noticeable when using the phone. To clarify it’s on everything and gives any brighter colors kind of a gritty texture. It’s not too noticeable at max brightness but at like 30ish percent whites everything looks almost like it’s made of paper. \n\nThis is definitely something I would have noticed in the past month and a half and only appears to have began either today or at most the past couple days. I’ve tried restarting and all (it looks especially bad on the Apple logo when the phone boots up) and can’t seem to make it go away. Wondering if anyone else has/had something similar before I make my way to the Apple Store to have it looked at if it doesn’t resolve on its own.",

    "title": "PSA: iPhones have 2 MAJOR problems, here's the solution for framerate stutter & 120Hz drops!",
    "selftext": "If you want context for how much research/time I've invested into this issue, scroll down to the bottom of the post for details.\n\n# Introduction: iPhones Stutter & Refresh Rates Drop Frequently!\n\nIf you look online, there are large amounts of reports around iOS 16-18 about said issues. That's when it started for most. At least as far as I can tell.\n\nI bought an iPhone 15 Pro less than 2 years ago and used an iPhone 6+ from 2015 - late 2022.  I upgraded from 500 nits brightness to 2000. I was going from 60Hz to 120Hz. I had a PC with 240-360Hz for 5+ years before then. I knew what to look for. It was great out of the box.  \nI never had **ANY** issues the first 1.5 years using it.\n\nThen I HAD to update my OS which I made sure NEVER TO DO. There is a reason. Every update for every company especially Mac/Windows seems to be investor pleasing \"Push it out early and buggy, fix it later, promise big, underdeliver\". The Horrendous and continuation to this day release of \"Apple Intelligence\" only further cemented the reasoning. I had no choice, it was for work and an app I needed to use required a newer version.\n\nIt became apparent after the update and getting back into mobile games and tweaking safari to support 120hz recently with developer feature flags (*\"Disable Prefer Page Rendering Updates near 60Hz\"*) That something was VERY wrong. Swiping in menus in games that have toggle to enable high frame rates was unbelievably choppy. Far above what even 60 hz would look like. So I tried all of the usual suspects, which you can also try at the bottom of this post under the \"Options to try for Troubleshooting\" Which is EXTENSIVE to say the least and I have more unlisted if you wish to hear them.Finally after running out of hope I decided to try one extremely desperate last ditch attempt.\n\n# Recovery Environment/Safe Boot!\nIf you don't know, sometimes computers don't \"Just work\". Who would have thunk it!  \nThis is where Recovery Environment/Safe boot kick in. They are meant to never be used by normal people. Usually Technicians or IT staff only.\nSo I did the manual restart but instead keep holding it until the \"Connect your phone pops up\"!\nAll I did was unplug my phone from the wall and pressed the power button and held it down and restarted my phone.\n\nThe system restarted but it told me \n\"It looks like your system had trouble restarting, we are going to check and make sure everything is running alright\". It completed and SAID \"No errors found\" but this took literally over 5-10 minutes to complete. So I have my doubts that the report is saying \n\"We found no errors at all and everything was fine\" \nor if the report is saying \n\"We found no errors that we couldn't FIX\". But regardless. It worked... IT WORKED! My screen was buttery smooth again and closing and opening apps and games was AMAZING, through and through!\nit was so obviously better because there was ZERO hitches or pauses or frame jitter doing ANYTHING! It was like a brand new phone! \nI don't know why, I don't have any FACTUAL evidence to support this either. I can have my speculations but regardless. My phone even after I load a bunch of apps and a video in the background at full resolution and playing my games. All My problems just VANISHED.\n\n# Conclusion: \nIf you are like me and have been trying to solve this issue that you may not even know exists because people can forget from time to time. Then maybe this is your solution. If it doesn't work for you I'm hoping one of my possible suggestions gives you hope. Worst case scenario maybe take it to Apple and see. It might cost a pretty penny. But if you are bothered by it enough and have the income. Maybe try that if you want to be safer.\n\nI hope that this was at least a fun to read post on my adventures and maybe we'll come together and see if it does help people. Who knows! Take care!\n(If you want to see my speculative answer on why this fixed everything completely see below under the title \"Speculative explanation\".\n\n# Speculative explanation\n\nOne thig I know about Recovery Environment and Safe Boot is that they are essentially the phone launching with BARE BONES ONLY features enabled. \n## Example of why this helps differently vs manual Restart:\nAt least as far as my IT experience has shown in WINDOWS. There are times where services sometimes can get stuck in an infinite loop of failing to restart. If the component that is trying to restart like an app with lots of graphics or demanding software like a game or Adobe Suite for example. If it constantly restarts in the background. It can DESTROY performance even on the highest end desktops. I would know, I've seen it on my maxxed out rig at home! What some people recommend online is to see if launching these modes resolves the issue temporarily. If they do then you can narrow down that it's not a CRITICAL service that's failing. You can narrow it down to a service that is part of the STARTUP sequence. That part is likely what you see the apple logo for or the windows logo is the equivalent.\nSometimes programmers or windows can detect in safe mode that an app is behaving incorrectly or the app itself can detect it's behaving incorrectly and because you have forced the cycle to STOP FULLY once. It's essentially telling halting the process and ENDING IT. Which is different than restarting which can gracefully close things.\nBut if it's a task or scheduled thing that was supposed to only happens once and never does complete and is scheduled to restart if it fails. Then that's how this unique instance can fix issues. Because if the script is told to STOP because the service to even run it doesn't start. Then the script or task or startup can be coded in a way to terminate itself an delete the task. It happens sometimes on a botched windows update.\n\n# Options to try for Troubleshooting\n### Disable (Background App Refresh): \nSettings>General>Background app refresh\n**Note:** This prevents apps doing things in the background like updates and pushing notifications or changing things when they aren't in active use. It is known to help reduce drag and slowdowns on your system. Especially if you have lots of apps, it helps on ANY operating system. Not just iOS/Mac\n\n### Disable (limit framerate): \nSettings > Accessibility > Motion - Scroll down to the bottom \n**Note:** This is enabled if you enable things like power power mode, which most do!\n\n### Deleting Cache (Clearing History & Website Data): \nSettings - Scroll down to bottom > Apps > Safari > \"Clear History and Website Data\"  \n**Note:** This is a setting as old as time itself it seems. Some users especially on some machines can have hundreds or thousands of pieces of data when they use safari. It does slow down your system a lot especially if you have never done this!\n\n### Disable Telemetry (app analytics/location tracking/sharing data)\nSettings > Privacy & Security > You have to decide what you want on.\nAlso\nSettings > Cellular > Scroll down to \"Allow cellular Usage statistics\" \n**NOTE** Be careful in particular with FindMy/Location sharing with certain apps, like messages show your location below your profile icon while texting. Disabling this breaks that so don't disable it if you are sharing your location!\n\n### Updating All Apps (App Store)\nApp Store > Click Profile Icon (Top Right) > Scroll down hit \"Update All\".\n**Note** This is usually only advised if the app you are using exclusively needs it or it's isolated issues to that app alone. Not advisable in general for the same reason listed above.\n\n### Manually Restart (Not Shutdown)\nPress Volume Up for a second, Press Volume Down for a second, HOLD DOWN the power button until you see the apple logo appear\n\n### Using Screen Recording (This is a common trick that's well known) \nIf you enable screen capture you will force the display to capture at fixed 120Hz. \n**Note** It is an odd workaround and obviously not recommended, but if you need it for a pinch or trying to debug/troubleshoot like I did. You can try.\n\n### Using Picture-In-Picture\nThere are some apps that report the refresh rate of your display while they are in Picture-In-Picture and even force 120Hz. An app called \"Floating Clock Pro\" is a good example. If you Enable Picture-In-Picture you'll notice that on the home screen when it's static or nothing is moving. It will say 60Hz. And when you touch the screen it enables 120Hz temporarily and reverts back to 60. This is showing you that it's POSSIBLE and tells you when it's on.\nMine was still a Stutter/Choppy mess even in games reporting 120Hz 24/7.\nLike Clash Royale as an example, it would load fine and look smooth for the first few seconds. But then swipe left or right and then the whole game \"Reports\" 120Hz but clearly looks like 30Hz forever until I fully close the game and reopen or turn off my phone. This is again further cementing that this is NOT user error or misunderstanding how the technology works.\n\n### Clearing up Storage\nSettings > General > iPhone Storage > Scroll down to see if you have an outsized usage in an app you may not even realize exists!\n\n### Disable Cloud Sync/Backup **Temporarily**\nSettings > Click on account Name at the top > iCloud > iCloud Backup > \"Backup over cellular\" or \"Backup this iPhone/iPad/iMac/Macbook\" etc\nDepending on how intense you want to troubleshoot you can temporarily disable your icloud sync/backup because some users have so much data they are backing up at this very moment that it can seriously drain your battery and slow your phone to a crawl!\n\n### Disable Low Power Modes\nSettings > Battery > Power Mode > Adaptive Power and Low Power Mode \nBoth should be disabled to rule out any issues.\nAlso\nSettings > Wifi > Select Connected/Known Wifi's \"I\" Icon to the right.\nDisable Low Data Mode \n**NOTE** This one is tricky because it can equally hurt you to disable Low data mode because Low data mode also pauses background activity and network data usage like updates. So it's only worthwhile to test THIS setting if you know you don't have any updates. Otherwise keep it on to reduce more background activity. \nIf you are using an app that needs internet especially if you are loading/uploading/downloading actively. Low data mode can throttle the download and cause the whole phone or app to be nearly unresponsive. You can test this on your router by making a rate limited Network and trying to use certain cloud apps or load websites. It will break some things.\n\n### Reduce Temperatures (Nuanced)\nIf you take your phone cover off and feel the back or front of your phone and it feels even remotely hot. It is quite normal for the system to throttle it's performance to reduce temperatures. It's a protection mechanism and some cases have terrible association with this.\nIf you u\n\nThere are a lot of people who don't use iCloud or don't know that they have storage they can offload TONS of data to. I have 256GB of storage on my phone and only using 50-100GB which is very good and well below normal usage. The ideal is less than 80% of your full rated capacity.\n\n### The Last Solution (Factory Resetting)\nOnly do this as a last resort if my suggested fix of going into recovery environment doesn't fix it.\nThis is the one that takes the most time but it always usually works because it's a hard reset of the entire system and requires you to redownload files and apps and everything.\n\n\n# Context of my background:\nI am not an average user or ignorant of these topics and how they work. I work in IT everyday as my primary job and have gone to college as well to pursue this insane passion of mine with a bachelors in web development. \nI have been an iPhone user my entire life going on 15+ years. I have been working in IT for 5-10+ years, I have an insane passion for computers and have gone to college and spend hours every day learning about different terminology for things because it all fascinates me like nothing ever has. I have a colorimeter at my home and have a thorough understanding of almost every aspect when it comes to displays and how they work.",

I've spent countless hours doing this over and over again for almost the past year lol, I seriously just need somebodies advice on the literal easiest and least mind numbing way to do this. \n\nIt would help so greatly if somebody could explain deleting the exact things that I back up off the phone, so I don't have to go hunt through my camera roll.\n",

My charging cable was kinda old and only worked when bent a certain way — I used to feel tiny shocks or tickles from it for a few days, so I ignored it.\n\nWhile I was playing PUBG, suddenly I got a massive electric shock through my right arm that went all the way down to my left leg. I screamed out loud, my cousin thought I saw a snake or something 😭. It was super painful and even left a red mark on my foot where the current probably exited.\n\nTurns out the charger and extensions weren’t grounded, and since my iPhone’s back glass is broken, current was leaking through the phone’s metal frame. Before this, when I touched my cousin while holding the phone, he’d feel a little current too (we used to laugh about it), but when I touched my brother, nothing happened. Wild.\n\nAnyway, I’m fine now, but this was seriously dangerous. Please don’t make the same mistake:\n\t•\tDon’t use cheap or damaged chargers/cables.\n\t•\tIf your phone shocks you even slightly, unplug it immediately.\n\t•\tFix cracked glass — it’s not just looks.\n\t•\tUse a grounded socket or a single, good-quality extension.\n\nI got lucky that the current went through my arm and leg, not my chest. Please take this seriously. Electricity is no joke. ⚡ Stay safe, everyone.",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

I'd set a wake-up alarm for 9:00AM, tell Siri \"cancel my wake-up alarm\", then she'll respond \"I couldn't find the alarm you're asking for\". \n\nI was planning on upgrading to a newer iphone, but I am seeing no signs of improvement for either Siri or the speech to text. Is there any insider info at all about any notable progress for Siri or the speech-to-text keyboard? I have been a lifelong iPhone user but am on the verge of  switching if it continues to be like this without radical improvements to either software.

    "selftext": "[Apple TechWoven Black](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mgf84ll/a/iphone-17-pro-max-techwoven-case-with-magsafe-black?fnode=f66bfe4c303d48f15e7d6e0b9fce037ec03553bba7182bf556a16b2d767804b04b55b73e9d99732d519f07a3ec2f63773f1878c38a9a582abca9a57ad94ca55507080375c241ef5b3ef8821c95e76b9564a07a5ad4da2b285654926ca929a962): Some dirt and grime gets trapped in the case tech woven mesh surface, I didn't like that the case doesn't fully cover the front, therefore you have a silver line around the screen, and last, the exposed camera plateau, it looks nice, but, to me, personally, it is a risk of getting damage easily. But, it is a beautiful design, and the look & feel of the case holding the phone, is great, I love the case.\n\n[Spigen Ultra Hybrid T](https://www.spigen.com/products/iphone-17-series-case-ultra-hybrid-t-magfit?variant=44454258769967): Case looks very nice with the Silver phone, but the edges are sharp and uncomfortable to hold, they are not round. The buttons (with the exception of the Camera button) are the worst I have used. The sides are TPU, therefore they yellow over time. I had an issue with the case, contacted customer support, and in 2 days I had a brand new case in my hands, excellent service, for a case that cost less than $20.\n\n[dbrand Ghost Case 2.0](https://dbrand.com/shop/ghost/iphone-17-pro-max-clear-cases): Case looks very nice, probably one of the best designs available, I like the grip of the sides, buttons are amazing. The quality of the case is not up to the look and design of the case, multiple reports of peeling of in the back, close to the camera/flash holes. Then, when you try to engage customer support, things go completely south, slow to no response, just to get a case replaced via warranty, can take weeks to months.\n\n[Smartish Gripmunk](https://smartish.com/collections/size-iphone-17-pro-max/products/gripmunk-with-magsafe-slim-case-for-iphone-17-pro-max): Nice case, good grip on the sides, but the back is too soft and a fingerprint magnet, also, like the other open camera plateau cases, to me, personally, is too risky of getting damaged. I would say overall a very good case for a reasonable price.\n\n[Spigen Rugged Armor](https://www.spigen.com/products/iphone-17-series-case-rugged-armor-magfit?variant=44454200868911): Nice design, supper grippy all around, protection all around as well. At the beginning, I was worried about the Camera button being just a TPU cover, not being responsive or loosing functionality, but I was wrong, it is very good, no trade off, compared to better implementations of the camera button. The trade off is that you can't see the phone at all, is fully covered and protected, but I miss looking at the beautiful design of the silver 17PM.\n\n[Apple Clear Case](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mgfw4ll/a/iphone-17-pro-max-clear-case-with-magsafe?fnode=4db99315de047fbcadaab35a5ac87c3413a97f08bb214687f8ed409d27607a7673516719f73174237505f162de5f9b3d2e9d59b57d91cce4297c58d9e673f44113bc77192fc4fe777e11a19a4ebde350ba4942e146c86fec4af31593255d06a1): For the Silver 17PM this is probably the best looking case, the design and the quality of the case is the best, Apple made. The case is built with a quality that it will not scratch, and, it will not yellow, therefore it will always look clean and nice on the phone. I am not a fan of the open camera plateau, there is a risk of damage there, also I don't like the handling of the case, I mean it feels great on your hands, is round and supper soft, it is amazing the feeling, but, it is like handling a wet piece of soap, super slippery, therefore the probability of falling is high. Also, at least to me, the case is really hard to remove.\n\nAs you can see every case has pros and cons, I have not mentioned price, because all of them are in the range of $30 - $60 USD, that it is within my budget, so it is not a variable to consider to me, now, which case do you think I finally decided to keep?",

    "selftext": "My iPhone 14 Pro 256gb has broken front and back, cracked camera lens. Have had it for about 2.5-3 years. Backmarket website still will give me $159 for trade in, so I'm considering buying from them. Getting it fixed would be more expensive than any of the replacement options as well. I have narrowed my decision to these (all 256gb, price after trade in, and excellent condition):\n\n**14 Pro: $344**  \n**16e: $354**  \n**15: $388**  \n**15 Pro: $507**\n\nI'm having a hard time thinking the 15 pro is really worth $119-$163 more than the others, and kind of want to just save the money. I don't really care about the camera much, I'm sure any of them will have a good enough camera for me. I do however really like the 120hz refresh rate and worry about losing it a bit, but I also imagine I'd quickly get used to not having it. Battery life is important, which is why I'm only looking at their \"excellent\" condition phones. Part of me is leaning to the 14 Pro again, but I'd also like to finally be on USB-C. I don't game on my phone at all. Just social media, youtube, communication. Is there anything I'm missing? Should I consider anything else if I'm okay with the $500 range?",

Because sometimes his phone blocks thinking his screen time has reached its limit, but he claims he hasn’t used it that much. I don’t think he can (or is using) any detours like deleting/reinstalling apps, but something seems to causing problems. Can’t really find a solution Google, so was hoping someone here knows anything? Picture is from yesterdays phone use. ",

I just want to avoid having it slide out of my hands. It’s basically the only reason I’m using a (slim) case.\n\nAre there any skins/stick on stickers that provide the same?

    "selftext": "[Apple TechWoven Black](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mgf84ll/a/iphone-17-pro-max-techwoven-case-with-magsafe-black?fnode=f66bfe4c303d48f15e7d6e0b9fce037ec03553bba7182bf556a16b2d767804b04b55b73e9d99732d519f07a3ec2f63773f1878c38a9a582abca9a57ad94ca55507080375c241ef5b3ef8821c95e76b9564a07a5ad4da2b285654926ca929a962): Some dirt and grime gets trapped in the case tech woven mesh surface, I didn't like that the case doesn't fully cover the front, therefore you have a silver line around the screen, and last, the exposed camera plateau, it looks nice, but, to me, personally, it is a risk of getting damage easily. But, it is a beautiful design, and the look & feel of the case holding the phone, is great, I love the case.\n\n[Spigen Ultra Hybrid T](https://www.spigen.com/products/iphone-17-series-case-ultra-hybrid-t-magfit?variant=44454258769967): Case looks very nice with the Silver phone, but the edges are sharp and uncomfortable to hold, they are not round. The buttons (with the exception of the Camera button) are the worst I have used. The sides are TPU, therefore they yellow over time. I had an issue with the case, contacted customer support, and in 2 days I had a brand new case in my hands, excellent service, for a case that cost less than $20.\n\n[dbrand Ghost Case 2.0](https://dbrand.com/shop/ghost/iphone-17-pro-max-clear-cases): Case looks very nice, probably one of the best designs available, I like the grip of the sides, buttons are amazing. The quality of the case is not up to the look and design of the case, multiple reports of peeling of in the back, close to the camera/flash holes. Then, when you try to engage customer support, things go completely south, slow to no response, just to get a case replaced via warranty, can take weeks to months.\n\n[Smartish Gripmunk](https://smartish.com/collections/size-iphone-17-pro-max/products/gripmunk-with-magsafe-slim-case-for-iphone-17-pro-max): Nice case, good grip on the sides, but the back is too soft and a fingerprint magnet, also, like the other open camera plateau cases, to me, personally, is too risky of getting damaged. I would say overall a very good case for a reasonable price.\n\n[Spigen Rugged Armor](https://www.spigen.com/products/iphone-17-series-case-rugged-armor-magfit?variant=44454200868911): Nice design, supper grippy all around, protection all around as well. At the beginning, I was worried about the Camera button being just a TPU cover, not being responsive or loosing functionality, but I was wrong, it is very good, no trade off, compared to better implementations of the camera button. The trade off is that you can't see the phone at all, is fully covered and protected, but I miss looking at the beautiful design of the silver 17PM.\n\n[Apple Clear Case](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mgfw4ll/a/iphone-17-pro-max-clear-case-with-magsafe?fnode=4db99315de047fbcadaab35a5ac87c3413a97f08bb214687f8ed409d27607a7673516719f73174237505f162de5f9b3d2e9d59b57d91cce4297c58d9e673f44113bc77192fc4fe777e11a19a4ebde350ba4942e146c86fec4af31593255d06a1): For the Silver 17PM this is probably the best looking case, the design and the quality of the case is the best, Apple made. The case is built with a quality that it will not scratch, and, it will not yellow, therefore it will always look clean and nice on the phone. I am not a fan of the open camera plateau, there is a risk of damage there, also I don't like the handling of the case, I mean it feels great on your hands, is round and supper soft, it is amazing the feeling, but, it is like handling a wet piece of soap, super slippery, therefore the probability of falling is high. Also, at least to me, the case is really hard to remove.\n\nAs you can see every case has pros and cons, I have not mentioned price, because all of them are in the range of $30 - $60 USD, that it is within my budget, so it is not a variable to consider to me, now, which case do you think I finally decided to keep?",

    "selftext": "My iPhone 14 Pro 256gb has broken front and back, cracked camera lens. Have had it for about 2.5-3 years. Backmarket website still will give me $159 for trade in, so I'm considering buying from them. Getting it fixed would be more expensive than any of the replacement options as well. I have narrowed my decision to these (all 256gb, price after trade in, and excellent condition):\n\n**14 Pro: $344**  \n**16e: $354**  \n**15: $388**  \n**15 Pro: $507**\n\nI'm having a hard time thinking the 15 pro is really worth $119-$163 more than the others, and kind of want to just save the money. I don't really care about the camera much, I'm sure any of them will have a good enough camera for me. I do however really like the 120hz refresh rate and worry about losing it a bit, but I also imagine I'd quickly get used to not having it. Battery life is important, which is why I'm only looking at their \"excellent\" condition phones. Part of me is leaning to the 14 Pro again, but I'd also like to finally be on USB-C. I don't game on my phone at all. Just social media, youtube, communication. Is there anything I'm missing? Should I consider anything else if I'm okay with the $500 range?",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Alert: Feature creates Severe Vulnerability",
    "selftext": "Recently, I received a text from Android that during an update a new feature was automatically enabled. This feature is called Smart Wi-Fi and on the surface it seems like a great idea that will ensure you are always connected to Wi-Fi instead of using your Mobile Data. However, this feature is also enabled automatically (and this is important), which is one of the roots of the problem.\n\nBefore continuing, I should point out that I've been in IT for over 23 years, 12 of which were specializing in Cybersecurity and I currently hold both the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker through EC Council) as well as my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional through Offensive Security which is also an Ethical Hacker certification). With that out of the way, please allow me to explain what the vulnerability is and how it affects everyone that uses it.\n\nThe Smart Wi-Fi feature attempts to work much like Mesh Networking which is to say, you stay connected to a Wi-Fi network internet enabled device without interruption so the switch is seamless and instant, and it stays connected to the most powerful network detected, ensuring the strongest connection. This feature operates much like how Cisco and Ubiquity Unifi's Mesh networking works.\n\nThe big difference however is with Cisco and Unifi Mesh networking (and other similar mesh networking) you rely on multiple devices connected to the SAME network, thus you don't change networks but rather you stay connected to the closes device on the network you're attached to ensuring the best connection signal even when roaming around.\n\nWith me so far? Great! Now let's discuss the vulnerability.\n\nUnlike Mesh Networking as mentioned above, Smart Wi-Fi attempts to remain connected to Wi-Fi devices. It does state Known networks but in testing, I was able to connect to my rogue Wi-Fi network automatically despite not being in my known network list and the why is simple.\n\nThere's a technique known as Man-In-The-Middle or MITM for short, which is used by both Red Team (Penetration Testers/Ethical Hackers) as well as Threat Actors. In this process what I would do is set up my rogue Wi-Fi network provider and mimic the SSID of the network I want to compromise. I then leave the password option off and then broadcast the Wi-Fi signal at a stronger strength than what the devices inside the network I want to compromise is. Because of this Smart Wi-Fi feature, those with this SSID saved have a good chance of automatically connecting to my rogue Wi-Fi device and since I provide internet through it, they aren't the wiser. This happens as soon as the device they're connected to becomes weaker than mine. Once this happens, I may push a prompt that asks the user to reenter their Wi-Fi credentials, and if successful I just compromised the target networks security, bypassing it completely.\n\nHome owners will likely not have much to worry about as Threat Actors don't typically attempt to attack home networks - it's really a waste of time and effort with little to gain. However, government and businesses are prime targets.\n\nThe solution is to disable the option that is automatically enabled which allows your Android phone to connect to the strongest Known network. The risk isn't in connecting to known networks, but rather the automatic switching of networks which enables the use of SSID Spoofing and MITM attacks.\n\nI hope this does some of you good and hopefully Android's team will also see this and have this feature disabled by default instead of enabled. That way if people want to take the risk they can instead of being unaware of the risk in the first place.",

I’ve been working on something I’m really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It’s a great feature, but it’s locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built **MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to **any Android phone running Android 9 or above** — including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt’s still in early access and I’d love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper) \n\nThis is just the beginning - I’m actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you’re into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I’d really appreciate your input.",

    "title": "Android Verified Boot and the Bootloader Unlock Security Theater",
    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Alert: Feature creates Severe Vulnerability",
    "selftext": "Recently, I received a text from Android that during an update a new feature was automatically enabled. This feature is called Smart Wi-Fi and on the surface it seems like a great idea that will ensure you are always connected to Wi-Fi instead of using your Mobile Data. However, this feature is also enabled automatically (and this is important), which is one of the roots of the problem.\n\nBefore continuing, I should point out that I've been in IT for over 23 years, 12 of which were specializing in Cybersecurity and I currently hold both the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker through EC Council) as well as my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional through Offensive Security which is also an Ethical Hacker certification). With that out of the way, please allow me to explain what the vulnerability is and how it affects everyone that uses it.\n\nThe Smart Wi-Fi feature attempts to work much like Mesh Networking which is to say, you stay connected to a Wi-Fi network internet enabled device without interruption so the switch is seamless and instant, and it stays connected to the most powerful network detected, ensuring the strongest connection. This feature operates much like how Cisco and Ubiquity Unifi's Mesh networking works.\n\nThe big difference however is with Cisco and Unifi Mesh networking (and other similar mesh networking) you rely on multiple devices connected to the SAME network, thus you don't change networks but rather you stay connected to the closes device on the network you're attached to ensuring the best connection signal even when roaming around.\n\nWith me so far? Great! Now let's discuss the vulnerability.\n\nUnlike Mesh Networking as mentioned above, Smart Wi-Fi attempts to remain connected to Wi-Fi devices. It does state Known networks but in testing, I was able to connect to my rogue Wi-Fi network automatically despite not being in my known network list and the why is simple.\n\nThere's a technique known as Man-In-The-Middle or MITM for short, which is used by both Red Team (Penetration Testers/Ethical Hackers) as well as Threat Actors. In this process what I would do is set up my rogue Wi-Fi network provider and mimic the SSID of the network I want to compromise. I then leave the password option off and then broadcast the Wi-Fi signal at a stronger strength than what the devices inside the network I want to compromise is. Because of this Smart Wi-Fi feature, those with this SSID saved have a good chance of automatically connecting to my rogue Wi-Fi device and since I provide internet through it, they aren't the wiser. This happens as soon as the device they're connected to becomes weaker than mine. Once this happens, I may push a prompt that asks the user to reenter their Wi-Fi credentials, and if successful I just compromised the target networks security, bypassing it completely.\n\nHome owners will likely not have much to worry about as Threat Actors don't typically attempt to attack home networks - it's really a waste of time and effort with little to gain. However, government and businesses are prime targets.\n\nThe solution is to disable the option that is automatically enabled which allows your Android phone to connect to the strongest Known network. The risk isn't in connecting to known networks, but rather the automatic switching of networks which enables the use of SSID Spoofing and MITM attacks.\n\nI hope this does some of you good and hopefully Android's team will also see this and have this feature disabled by default instead of enabled. That way if people want to take the risk they can instead of being unaware of the risk in the first place.",

I've tried everything. Contacted my communications provider and they said it's not on their end. I put my SIM into another phone and confirmed the issue is to do with my device.\n\nI contacted Google Support who ran me through a myriad of troubleshooting steps in my settings to no success. Instead of being able to open a ticket all they advised to do was \"Submit Feedback\" through the phone app and describe my issue. Disappointing. I've done this 5 times now and nothing's happened.\n\nVery frustrating as I basically haven't had caller ID for 2 months now, have no idea who's calling me and if I miss a call and the person doesn't leave a voicemail I have no idea who to call back. Spam protection also seems to have stopped working as I'm getting tons more spam and robo calls since the issue started.\n\nI've been a Pixel user since the 3 and have generally been happy with the devices. It seems like I'm out of options now other than getting a new phone.\n\nHas anyone had this issue and any ideas how to resolve?",

But 9pro is much cheaper even than basic 10.\n\nI dont want to go full throttle into Android now, maybe I don’t like it, who knows. So while generally budget is not a problem at all, I will have easier time ditching 500€ phone than 1200€.\n\nI guess most important for me is\n- no UI lags/freezes, I would totally hate it\n- A bit smarter AI\n- A bit better integration to Google\n- Camera I dont care, owning an iPhone for now with a decent camera\n\nSo what do you say. 9a? 9pro? or 10? or maybe not a pixel at all?",

    "selftext": "I'm posting this because I spent weeks going absolutely mad trying to fix persistent Wi-Fi connectivity issues with my new Google Pixel 9 (this probably applies to the other series too). The connection was constantly dropping, or just refusing to connect to my home network. \n\nSome of my friends networks, or at the gym connected just fine. \n\n​I went through all the standard troubleshooting with Google Support: safe mode, network resets, factory resets... nothing worked. Eventually I had to send my phone for repair to the Google store , they determined there was a connectivity issue. But couldn't fix the phone because there were \"no spare parts\" for my model (weird, I know) and sent me a new Pixel 9.\n\n​Guess what? The exact same problems persisted.\n\n​That's when I realised the problem wasn't the phone; it was my older router. Modern phones like the Pixel sometimes have conflicts with certain older Wi-Fi defaults. After digging deep into the router settings by screenshotting them and pasting them into gemini asking what settings would be best for my pixel 9.\n\nI found a few key adjustments that completely fixed the issue and gave a solid Wi-Fi connection. \n\n\n​Setting Recommended for 2.4ghz\n\nChannel Bandwidth: Change from \"20/40\" or \"Auto\" to 20 MHz.\nMode: Change from \"11n Only\" to Mixed Mode (11b+11g+11n).\nChannel: Change from \"Auto\" or a high number (e.g., 13) to 1, 6, or 11.\nAPSD: Capable (Power Saving) Change from \"Enable\" to Disable.\n\nSetting Recommended for 5ghz\n\nMode: Ensure 802.11ac is enabled (e.g., \"Mixed 11a+11n+11ac\").\n\nChannel Bandwidth: Keep the highest option like 80 MHz or \"Auto 40/80 MHz\".\n\nBand Steering: If present, Disable it.\n\n",

Knowing that I always update through wifi. How can carrier intervene ? Does Google send the updates to the carriers the the latter sends it to the user ? ",

Last night while I'm outside the Comedy Cellar 3 men assaulted this woman. I called 911 but after it called my boss at 1 am in the morning and recorded the conversation. I'm not sure but it was a just my group discussing this woman bleeding out of her mouth and the back of her head, nothing too crazy. However, I don't my boss hearing my Friday night conversations. \n\n\nPlease help me turn this screen off. I've never had a phone turn on this much randomly.

The first scenario is if it's turned on and I apply pressure to the lower left half of the display it shuts off. The second scenario is if I turn the phone on while already applying pressure to that same area it works normally until I release the pressure, and it then shuts off. \n\nDue to this, I believe in the first scenario something is not making contact, and once I apply pressure it then does, and it causes the phone to shut off. In the second scenario it must be making contact before the phone is turned on, and once I release it the loss of contact is causing it to shut off.\n\n[Here is a video displaying the issue](https://imgur.com/a/FSuDJt9), does anyone know what could be causing this?

    "selftext": "Welcome to the Battery Megathread, where you can find information and get assistance with any battery-related issues your Pixel might be facing. *All battery-related posts made outside this megathread will be removed.*\n\nBefore you make a comment, try these troubleshooting tips:\n\n###Stay up to date with the latest version of Android and your apps.\nAlthough some people may argue that a system update ruined their battery life (and occasionally this is the cause), it's always a good idea to make sure you device is running the latest version of Android (check anytime in Settings > System > Advanced > System update > Check for update). Security patches and major updates bring fixes not only for battery-draining bugs, but also protection against viruses and malware that may be stealing your charge, or worse. Individual app updates may also provide performance improvements to your battery.\n\n###Check for power-hungry apps.\nDespite battery-saving features like [Doze](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html), some apps may still be able to drain away your charge undetected. Try the following steps to identify any power-hungry apps.\n\n* Make sure that the \"Apps consuming battery\" notification is enabled, and wait a few minutes to see if it appears. (Find the toggle in Settings > Apps & notifications > See all ___ apps > More options (the triple dot) > Show system > Android system > Notifications > Other)\n* Check the battery usage of your apps in Settings > Battery > More options (the triple dot) > Battery usage. Remember that battery life may be reduced with usage of certain features (location, Bluetooth, etc.) and apps (gaming, video, etc.).\n* Turn on battery optimizations for all apps, (Under Settings > Apps & notifications > Advanced > Special app access > Battery optimization, and tap each app to change it to *Optimize*), and also enable Adaptive Battery, which limits rarely used apps (Under Settings > Battery > Adaptive Battery).\n* Force stop or uninstall any new apps and monitor battery life. (You can do this by going into Settings > search for *appName* & select *appName*)\n* Temporarily disable all installed apps with Safe Mode, to see if an existing/updated app is the problem. (Enter Safe Mode by pressing & holding the power button, and then pressing and holding *Restart*, and finally tapping OK. To exit Safe Mode, restart your phone as normal. You may have to sign into some apps again.) If your battery life improves, use the aforementioned methods on older apps.\n\n###Investigate battery intensive features.\nSome functions on you phone may use more power than you expect, especially in different scenarios. Take a look at this list for **a few** possibilities:\n\n* **Bluetooth** is notorious for its high-energy usage, especially when actively transferring data. Turn it off if it's not needed, and if you do, consider looking for Bluetooth Low Energy devices, which need much less power.\n* **Location** also uses quite a bit in order to pinpoint your position. Turn off Wifi/Cellular data/Bluetooth location accuracy (Settings > Security and Location > Location > Advanced > Battery saving > Google Location Accuracy) or turn Location off completely.\n* **Cellular** can also drain your battery when the signal is weak. At these times, more electricity is needed to stay connected, no matter if you're in the forest or underground. If you don't require a cellular connection (for example, if you have Wifi Calling), put your phone into Airplane mode and re-enable Wifi/Bluetooth if needed.\n\n###Contact Google Support.\nGoogle's dedicated Pixel support team may be able to help diagnose and fix your issue. Find them in Settings > Tips & Support, or just ask your Google Assistant \"troubleshoot my battery\".\n\n###IF ALL ELSE FAILS, factory reset your phone.\nSometimes wiping your phone is all that's needed to bring your battery back to life. Google Drive and Google Photos do a decent job with keeping your apps and data (check in Settings > Google > Backup > Back up now **and check** Google Photos > sidebar (the three lines) > Settings > Backup and sync), but ***please personally make sure that everything is backed up to something off your phone.*** To wipe your phone, [follow the steps here.](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4596836)\n\n*This megathread will be replaced on the 1^st of each month at 10:00 UTC.

    "title": "Google Pixel Support Experience Has Been Mentally Draining. How Do I Escalate To A Grievance Officer?",
    "selftext": "I want to share an extremely disappointing experience with Google Pixel support in India and seek guidance from the community on how to escalate this to the correct Grievance Officer as required under the Consumer Protection rules.\n\nThis started with a simple request to replace an original Pixel case that began peeling. What followed has been a draining and unnecessary struggle that no customer should have to go through:\n\n* Endless back and forth asking for the same information again and again even after submitting valid proof\n* Support insisted on Google Maps based address verification which is one sided and unrealistic in India and I had to go through the process of getting my address added to Maps just to move forward\n* Replacement was withheld because of a rigid policy that they will ship the new item only after they physically receive the old one which puts the entire waiting time and inconvenience on the customer\n* Shipment got stuck in transit for days with zero ownership taken by support and everything kept getting delayed\n* No coordination or accountability across support agents social media responses and email teams and no one took end to end responsibility\n* After all this stress the replacement that finally arrived was in the wrong color despite written confirmation from Google Support that it would match the original\n\nThis entire journey has been mentally exhausting and reflects a serious lack of customer centricity especially from a global brand that promotes quality and trust.\n\nTo escalate responsibly before going public, I also wrote to [**support-in@google.com**]() as the designated India support address but received no response at all. What is even more concerning is that I requested the official Grievance Officer contact details multiple times which customers in India are legally entitled to under the Consumer Protection Act and the request was continuously ignored.\n\nAt this point I am posting this for two reasons:\n\n1. So others are aware of what kind of support to expect if their Pixel accessory goes bad in India\n2. To request guidance from anyone who has successfully escalated a case to Google India’s Grievance Officer for consumer issues\n\nIf anyone has the correct and official contact details of the Grievance Officer for Google India or a working escalation path that actually responds please share it. It will help ensure that this situation is handled properly and hopefully prevent other consumers from going through the same ordeal.\n\nNo customer should be pushed through such a painful process for a basic replacement. I hope this helps drive some awareness and pushes for better accountability.",

I'm still baffled that google maps doesn't prompt my next calendar event when Waze does without a hitch?\n\nApple has copped alot of flack for their AI achievements but I personally never had any issues with doing any of the above tasks with Siri along with messaging tasks on various apps or weather questions. \n\nUnless I'm doing a google search question or finding out what the weather will be like., it's near useless as a \"assistant\". \n\nAm I alone here? Am I speaking to it incorrectly or is Gemini literally that detached, slow and clunky in comparison to Siri? ",

    "selftext": "A couple weeks ago and out of nowhere,  my phone decided it didn't want to recognize the sim card. Rebooted it, which did work, but would soon lose connection to sim again (usually within minutes). \n\nContacted Google support who confirmed a hardware issue and gave 3 options. (Perform a factory reset, send for repair or get replacement). Tried the factory reset that day, but didn't fix the problem. Called Google support the following day and asked for a replacement. That's when the support team rep said they encountered an error since my phone was purchased through third party (it was through Telus - large Canadian telecom company). Was asked to send over service agreement, which I did right away. Telus is an authorized dealer, so no issues there\n\nIt's been now a week and Google is still unable to send me the link to order my replacement phone. \n\nAlso, the phone is getting worse by the day. \n\n-Front screen becomes unresponsive sometimes, open to the dual screen and that works. Had to boot in safe mode to get front screen working again\n\n-huge lag when unfolding to dual screen and back to front screen,  where screen remains black. Have to push power button for it to respond\n\n-phone intermittently powers off. Won't turn back on with power button. Had to plug into charger and wait 15 minutes and then powered on (battery was well above 50%)\n\n-random screen flickers and audio issues. Then powers off on its own\n\nI've owned pixel phones since OG pixel. I own a business with 10 phone lines (many of them pixel phones). I even got my kids and wife on the pixel train\n\nBut, after enduring minor issues with every single pixel phone, this current issue is really making me question my loyalty to Google devices.  \n\nIt's not even the issues that's the main problem for me. The fact it's been 1.5 weeks and they can't even figure out how to send the link to order my replacement is ridiculous. \n\nThat's my rant. I hope this post helps others going through similar issue with their device.",

And when I go to the \"free up space\" option again it says \"everything is freed up, try backing up more media to be able to free up more\", but everything is backed up. I can confirm it is backed up because it says everything is backed up in the photos app, and also when I click on every picture or video individually, it says it is backed up.

    "title": "Pixels: Why are they still \"almost\" good?",
    "selftext": "Lifelong android and PC power user here; I've built desktops, worked in tech support, rooted and messed around with countless phones. In the last 3 years I've started using more of the Apple ecosystem (sounds of shock!) for work... Mac, phone, AirPods; you get the gist.\n\nAs an average user (and most of us are), I'm amazed how Pixels (and PCs, Samsung etc) still aren't able to make the user experience as good as Apple. Some peeves I couldn't shake off:\n\n**Pixel phone 9 pro:**\n\n* Camera: It's 2024 (when it was released). Why is the OIS still jittery? Why is the transition between zoom options still not smooth? Guys, you're claiming to be a flagship phone that I can use to take photos of my kids. Fucking get it right already. It's \"almost good\" but not quite.\n* Reception: My cell reception drops once every few weeks; I have to restart to get it back. A flagship phone \\*must\\* have better quality control. You're trashing your own brand image!\n* Lag: Basic app-switching tends to crash at least twice a month. Am I on Windows 2000? (Nevermind, that was worse)\n* UI: Callout - The universal back button is god-like. Please have your UX team think about how to reduce number of swipes and taps to get to commonly used items. Both iOS and Android do a piss poor job in their own area, but if Android wants to differentiate itself then this needs to get better still. It's \"almost good\" but still not.\n\n**Pixel buds pro 2:**\n\n* Sound: Comparing to AirPods Pro 2 (which released earlier)- the sound is simply not as good. Sorry guys, why the hell did I pay the same amount for this trash?\n* ANC: For my old ears the difference has been minimal; I can let it slide\n* Transparency: Absolute rubbish. It feels like I'm listening through layers of clothing; I usually give up and just take my buds off.\n* Controls: I've had the buds for over a year and I still can't tap it the right way. Always I think \"FFS just work!\". You could say I'm dumb, and I'll argue that a bud at this price point is meant to be easy, it's meant for a dumb user.\n* Ergonomics: Every time I tap the buds it feels like I'm going to go deaf with the heavy thump on my ear (I tried being gentle). I don't know if it's inevitable because there's no stem or if this is poor sounds insulation. Either ways, not a good look for \"premium\" earphones.\n\nDo I still use my Pixel phone? Yes, but for music and camera I increasingly migrate to my iPhone.\n\nDo I still use my pixel buds? Hell no, that crap makes me yearn for the AirPods.\n\nDo I want to switch to Apple full-time? No I don't, but I'm sorely tempted as I get older and care less about UI customization.\n\nGoogle, please figure out if you truly want to deliver flagship hardware. Otherwise stop pretending and ruining your brand.",

Everything feels so much smoother when scrolling. \n\nThe screen is great, it gets bright as hell and everything looks great on it, the keyboard is infinitely better than iOS, notifications are handled way better. \n\nThe camera to me is way better. I can easily point and shoot and get a quality picture with this phone. Video recording looks better on the iPhone but not a ton better to my old color blind eyes. \n\nI got the mint mobile deal, $847 with tax for the 256gb pixel 10 pro xl and a year of unlimited service. They gave me $375 for my iPhone so I really can't complain. \n\nI'm still figuring some android stuff out but as of now I can't complain about the phone at all",

Is it a downgrade, or does it have useful features?\nWhat's the camera experience really like compared to Pixel's point-and-shoot magic?\nAm I going to severely miss the Pixel-exclusive features (like Call Screen, Now Playing, etc.)?\nWhat about software updates and long-term support?\nAny thoughts, pros, or cons you could share would be hugely appreciated.

    "selftext": "On iOS, you can rapidly press the power button 5 times to immediately disable Face ID and require PIN entry to unlock. You can do this quickly and discreetly without ever taking your phone out of your pocket.\n\nTo activate lockdown mode on a Pixel 9 Pro, you must press and hold the power button and volume button simultaneously (try doing this with one hand) and then look at the screen and tap the \"Lockdown\" button (altogether impossible to do without removing the phone from my pocket).\n\nIMO, this is absurd for a security feature and feels increasingly risky given the state of affairs today. Having to pull out your phone, navigate menus, and use both hands completely defeats the purpose. In a situation where you actually need this feature, drawing that kind of attention could make things worse.\n\nAm I the only one frustrated by this? Is there some workaround I'm missing?",

I’ve had iPhone for a long time (don’t judge!) because I really wasn’t a fan of the Galaxy phones and I grew up in Silicon Valley in an area that was using Apple products since I was in elementary school. I know, I know, they’re not the only androids out there, as my friend has told me. Anyway, I started my family and got iPads and am pretty Apple integrated. A lot of accessories are readily available for iPhone like cases and screen protectors. But I’ve been thinking about maybe switching to the Pixel because I love Google. I’ve been using Chrome since forever. I always hated Safari and only used Firefox briefly - once Chrome came out, I never went back. So how many pixel users are out there? I see almost everyone and their mother use iPhones. I love iMessage but now there’s RCS. I have an Apple Watch 11 but the battery life is still meh after all these years. Anyway, thanks for any feedback in advance! ",

    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI recently replaced the battery for my Pixel 5. After the replacement I noticed the in-ear speaker wasn't working anymore as someone called me. \n\nWhat happens is: the screen goes blank when the phone tries to use the in-ear speaker and I have to touch the screen again to use it. When I switch on the bottom speaker that one works, switching to bluetooth headset works as well. If I switch back to in-ear speaker, the screen goes blank again.  \nIt looks like the phone tries to switch but then bugs, like it doesn't find the in-ear speaker?\n\nA few weeks after I replaced the battery I replaced the screen as well as it was damaged anyway. I thought it would fix the in-ear speaker since a brand new ear speaker came attached to it (it's attached on the back).   \nI replaced the screen succesfully but I still have the same issue.\n\n  \nSince the issue appeared after a maintenance I guess I did something wrong and might have disconnected something, or worse, damaged something.  \nI read on a forum:\n\n\n\n>\"I noticed that the 2 contact leads of the speaker are very close to each other, so precise alignment when placing it back to the new LCD is very important. It was erratic, worked on and off after reboot or after pressing the screen where the speaker is located underneath (5 o'clock of the front camera). I think vibrations from sound and gentle knocking may cause the 2 leads to be out of alignment.  \nI solved the issue after reopening the screen and did some realignment.\"\n\n  \nWhile replacing the screen I checked the two connectors and they looked fine, so idk. On a teardown video I saw there is a connector underneath a protection that I had to remove to replace the battery, so maybe I made a mistake there?\n\nI would like to know if any of you have met the same issue and if there are additional, software side things I can try before I open the phone again (which I diligently sealed with glue so I'd have to use the heatgun again and clean etc. while trying not to damage the very fragile screen, which is slightly annoying)\n\n  \nThank you so much :)",

A better looking 3.5x zoom photo:\n\nIf you miss the 3.5x zoom perspective for human portrait shots, zoom over the 5X slider until the tele lens kicks-in and drag the slider slowly back to 3.5X and then click the shutter. This will process an image which has the details from the 5X lens fusioned with the Main lens's digital crop. The resulting picture is highly usable if the subject in the frame is one or two people. You can also use Google photos to apply the blur which creates a decent potrait image.\n\n2. A better zoom lens transition in video:\n\nIf you want a better zoom transition/switch between the lenses, just before hitting the video record button try to zoom in and zoom out of the 5x lens manually for a few times. By doing so you will observe that the transition to the 5X lens becomes a bit faster than the usual. Once you feel it, you can hit on the recorder button and then zoom in.\n\nIdeally Google should make these stuff available by default but i am glad that they are present at least. ",

The powerful Tensor chip then starts blurring every single face in the frame, except for the faces you have manually selected by tapping them.\nWhy this is awesome:\n\nIt’s incredibly convenient.\n\nIt’s especially useful for journalists and content creators who need to protect the privacy of people in the background.\n\nIt’s a perfect use case for the on-device power of the Tensor chip.",

    "selftext": "Got both a 10Pro and a 10Pro XL, and the difference in one hand usability of the two phones is staggering. When you put one phone on top of another, it doesn't feel like much of a difference, but as soon as you use the phone one handed, the difference is night and day.\n\nUsing the XL without a case seems ok, but even then it's huge if you put it in your jean front pocket. And with the no-grip polished rails, it's a little scary.\n\nThe smaller 10Pro is the way to go for actual use on the go. Maybe I am biased since I am coming from a Galaxy S22, which is so svelte - compact and \\~160grams.\n\nIt's also crazy that Google charges $100 extra for the XL. (256 vs 256) For slightly faster charging and nothing else ? (it has lower PPI on the screen. The larger battery is mainly for the bigger screen.)\n\nEdit1: After doing some more comparison, the speaker on the XL is noticeably better. I watched teardowns of both, and both seem to be using the same bottom speakers, so it's not clear to me why the XL sounds better.\n\nEdit2: XL without case and 10Pro with case (clear spigen) are roughly the same dimension and even weight. Slightly less thick, but very slightly wide and very slightly taller.\n\nEdit3: For people that use the phone for watching content, the XL is obviously better.\n\nFor the pixel 11Pro XL, if they can shave 1mm of bezel on all 4 edges, and put a physically smaller battery, (either Si-C, or more power efficient SoC) they could also reduce the thickness.  It's possible that, those things in combination can make the phone more one-hand use and pocket friendly.",

The lifted pattern is exactly the same everytime and I can't see it being anything else.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/z5ZM4S7Dd3EqmGiH9\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue?\n\n\n",

The connection was constantly dropping, or just refusing to connect to my home network. \n\nSome of my friends networks, or at the gym connected just fine. \n\n​I went through all the standard troubleshooting with Google Support: safe mode, network resets, factory resets... nothing worked. Eventually I had to send my phone for repair to the Google store , they determined there was a connectivity issue. But couldn't fix the phone because there were \"no spare parts\" for my model (weird, I know) and sent me a new Pixel 9.\n\n​Guess what? The exact same problems persisted.\n\n​That's when I realised the problem wasn't the phone; it was my older router. Modern phones like the Pixel sometimes have conflicts with certain older Wi-Fi defaults. After digging deep into the router settings by screenshotting them and pasting them into gemini asking what settings would be best for my pixel 9.\n\nI found a few key adjustments that completely fixed the issue and gave a solid Wi-Fi connection. \n\n\n​Setting Recommended for 2.4ghz\n\nChannel Bandwidth: Change from \"20/40\" or \"Auto\" to 20 MHz.\nMode: Change from \"11n Only\" to Mixed Mode (11b+11g+11n).\nChannel: Change from \"Auto\" or a high number (e.g., 13) to 1, 6, or 11.\nAPSD: Capable (Power Saving) Change from \"Enable\" to Disable.\n\nSetting Recommended for 5ghz\n\nMode: Ensure 802.11ac is enabled (e.g., \"Mixed 11a+11n+11ac\").\n\nChannel Bandwidth: Keep the highest option like 80 MHz or \"Auto 40/80 MHz\".\n\nBand Steering: If present, Disable it.\n\n",

    "title": "Battery Megathread (November 2025)",
    "selftext": "Welcome to the Battery Megathread, where you can find information and get assistance with any battery-related issues your Pixel might be facing. *All battery-related posts made outside this megathread will be removed.*\n\nBefore you make a comment, try these troubleshooting tips:\n\n###Stay up to date with the latest version of Android and your apps.\nAlthough some people may argue that a system update ruined their battery life (and occasionally this is the cause), it's always a good idea to make sure you device is running the latest version of Android (check anytime in Settings > System > Advanced > System update > Check for update). Security patches and major updates bring fixes not only for battery-draining bugs, but also protection against viruses and malware that may be stealing your charge, or worse. Individual app updates may also provide performance improvements to your battery.\n\n###Check for power-hungry apps.\nDespite battery-saving features like [Doze](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html), some apps may still be able to drain away your charge undetected. Try the following steps to identify any power-hungry apps.\n\n* Make sure that the \"Apps consuming battery\" notification is enabled, and wait a few minutes to see if it appears. (Find the toggle in Settings > Apps & notifications > See all ___ apps > More options (the triple dot) > Show system > Android system > Notifications > Other)\n* Check the battery usage of your apps in Settings > Battery > More options (the triple dot) > Battery usage. Remember that battery life may be reduced with usage of certain features (location, Bluetooth, etc.) and apps (gaming, video, etc.).\n* Turn on battery optimizations for all apps, (Under Settings > Apps & notifications > Advanced > Special app access > Battery optimization, and tap each app to change it to *Optimize*), and also enable Adaptive Battery, which limits rarely used apps (Under Settings > Battery > Adaptive Battery).\n* Force stop or uninstall any new apps and monitor battery life. (You can do this by going into Settings > search for *appName* & select *appName*)\n* Temporarily disable all installed apps with Safe Mode, to see if an existing/updated app is the problem. (Enter Safe Mode by pressing & holding the power button, and then pressing and holding *Restart*, and finally tapping OK. To exit Safe Mode, restart your phone as normal. You may have to sign into some apps again.) If your battery life improves, use the aforementioned methods on older apps.\n\n###Investigate battery intensive features.\nSome functions on you phone may use more power than you expect, especially in different scenarios. Take a look at this list for **a few** possibilities:\n\n* **Bluetooth** is notorious for its high-energy usage, especially when actively transferring data. Turn it off if it's not needed, and if you do, consider looking for Bluetooth Low Energy devices, which need much less power.\n* **Location** also uses quite a bit in order to pinpoint your position. Turn off Wifi/Cellular data/Bluetooth location accuracy (Settings > Security and Location > Location > Advanced > Battery saving > Google Location Accuracy) or turn Location off completely.\n* **Cellular** can also drain your battery when the signal is weak. At these times, more electricity is needed to stay connected, no matter if you're in the forest or underground. If you don't require a cellular connection (for example, if you have Wifi Calling), put your phone into Airplane mode and re-enable Wifi/Bluetooth if needed.\n\n###Contact Google Support.\nGoogle's dedicated Pixel support team may be able to help diagnose and fix your issue. Find them in Settings > Tips & Support, or just ask your Google Assistant \"troubleshoot my battery\".\n\n###IF ALL ELSE FAILS, factory reset your phone.\nSometimes wiping your phone is all that's needed to bring your battery back to life. Google Drive and Google Photos do a decent job with keeping your apps and data (check in Settings > Google > Backup > Back up now **and check** Google Photos > sidebar (the three lines) > Settings > Backup and sync), but ***please personally make sure that everything is backed up to something off your phone.*** To wipe your phone, [follow the steps here.](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4596836)\n\n*This megathread will be replaced on the 1^st of each month at 10:00 UTC.

But 9pro is much cheaper even than basic 10.\n\nI dont want to go full throttle into Android now, maybe I don’t like it, who knows. So while generally budget is not a problem at all, I will have easier time ditching 500€ phone than 1200€.\n\nI guess most important for me is\n- no UI lags/freezes, I would totally hate it\n- A bit smarter AI\n- A bit better integration to Google\n- Camera I dont care, owning an iPhone for now with a decent camera\n\nSo what do you say. 9a? 9pro? or 10? or maybe not a pixel at all?",

I can easily point and shoot and get a quality picture with this phone. Video recording looks better on the iPhone but not a ton better to my old color blind eyes. \n\nI got the mint mobile deal, $847 with tax for the 256gb pixel 10 pro xl and a year of unlimited service.

    "selftext": "A couple weeks ago and out of nowhere,  my phone decided it didn't want to recognize the sim card. Rebooted it, which did work, but would soon lose connection to sim again (usually within minutes). \n\nContacted Google support who confirmed a hardware issue and gave 3 options. (Perform a factory reset, send for repair or get replacement). Tried the factory reset that day, but didn't fix the problem. Called Google support the following day and asked for a replacement. That's when the support team rep said they encountered an error since my phone was purchased through third party (it was through Telus - large Canadian telecom company). Was asked to send over service agreement, which I did right away. Telus is an authorized dealer, so no issues there\n\nIt's been now a week and Google is still unable to send me the link to order my replacement phone. \n\nAlso, the phone is getting worse by the day. \n\n-Front screen becomes unresponsive sometimes, open to the dual screen and that works. Had to boot in safe mode to get front screen working again\n\n-huge lag when unfolding to dual screen and back to front screen,  where screen remains black. Have to push power button for it to respond\n\n-phone intermittently powers off. Won't turn back on with power button. Had to plug into charger and wait 15 minutes and then powered on (battery was well above 50%)\n\n-random screen flickers and audio issues. Then powers off on its own\n\nI've owned pixel phones since OG pixel. I own a business with 10 phone lines (many of them pixel phones). I even got my kids and wife on the pixel train\n\nBut, after enduring minor issues with every single pixel phone, this current issue is really making me question my loyalty to Google devices.  \n\nIt's not even the issues that's the main problem for me. The fact it's been 1.5 weeks and they can't even figure out how to send the link to order my replacement is ridiculous. \n\nThat's my rant. I hope this post helps others going through similar issue with their device.",

I always believed that I receive those updates directly from Google but based on what I've read on other posts my carrier could have some control over it. If yes then how ? Knowing that I always update through wifi. How can carrier intervene ? Does Google send the updates to the carriers the the latter sends it to the user ? ",

    "selftext": "If you own a Pixel phones that have 5X tele-lens you can follow the below tricks. \n\n1. A better looking 3.5x zoom photo:\n\nIf you miss the 3.5x zoom perspective for human portrait shots, zoom over the 5X slider until the tele lens kicks-in and drag the slider slowly back to 3.5X and then click the shutter. This will process an image which has the details from the 5X lens fusioned with the Main lens's digital crop. The resulting picture is highly usable if the subject in the frame is one or two people. You can also use Google photos to apply the blur which creates a decent potrait image.\n\n2. A better zoom lens transition in video:\n\nIf you want a better zoom transition/switch between the lenses, just before hitting the video record button try to zoom in and zoom out of the 5x lens manually for a few times. By doing so you will observe that the transition to the 5X lens becomes a bit faster than the usual. Once you feel it, you can hit on the recorder button and then zoom in.\n\nIdeally Google should make these stuff available by default but i am glad that they are present at least. ",

    "title": "Pixels: Why are they still \"almost\" good?",
    "selftext": "Lifelong android and PC power user here; I've built desktops, worked in tech support, rooted and messed around with countless phones. In the last 3 years I've started using more of the Apple ecosystem (sounds of shock!) for work... Mac, phone, AirPods; you get the gist.\n\nAs an average user (and most of us are), I'm amazed how Pixels (and PCs, Samsung etc) still aren't able to make the user experience as good as Apple. Some peeves I couldn't shake off:\n\n**Pixel phone 9 pro:**\n\n* Camera: It's 2024 (when it was released). Why is the OIS still jittery? Why is the transition between zoom options still not smooth? Guys, you're claiming to be a flagship phone that I can use to take photos of my kids. Fucking get it right already. It's \"almost good\" but not quite.\n* Reception: My cell reception drops once every few weeks; I have to restart to get it back. A flagship phone \\*must\\* have better quality control. You're trashing your own brand image!\n* Lag: Basic app-switching tends to crash at least twice a month. Am I on Windows 2000? (Nevermind, that was worse)\n* UI: Callout - The universal back button is god-like. Please have your UX team think about how to reduce number of swipes and taps to get to commonly used items. Both iOS and Android do a piss poor job in their own area, but if Android wants to differentiate itself then this needs to get better still. It's \"almost good\" but still not.\n\n**Pixel buds pro 2:**\n\n* Sound: Comparing to AirPods Pro 2 (which released earlier)- the sound is simply not as good. Sorry guys, why the hell did I pay the same amount for this trash?\n* ANC: For my old ears the difference has been minimal; I can let it slide\n* Transparency: Absolute rubbish. It feels like I'm listening through layers of clothing; I usually give up and just take my buds off.\n* Controls: I've had the buds for over a year and I still can't tap it the right way. Always I think \"FFS just work!\". You could say I'm dumb, and I'll argue that a bud at this price point is meant to be easy, it's meant for a dumb user.\n* Ergonomics: Every time I tap the buds it feels like I'm going to go deaf with the heavy thump on my ear (I tried being gentle). I don't know if it's inevitable because there's no stem or if this is poor sounds insulation. Either ways, not a good look for \"premium\" earphones.\n\nDo I still use my Pixel phone? Yes, but for music and camera I increasingly migrate to my iPhone.\n\nDo I still use my pixel buds? Hell no, that crap makes me yearn for the AirPods.\n\nDo I want to switch to Apple full-time? No I don't, but I'm sorely tempted as I get older and care less about UI customization.\n\nGoogle, please figure out if you truly want to deliver flagship hardware. Otherwise stop pretending and ruining your brand.",

The first scenario is if it's turned on and I apply pressure to the lower left half of the display it shuts off. The second scenario is if I turn the phone on while already applying pressure to that same area it works normally until I release the pressure, and it then shuts off. \n\nDue to this, I believe in the first scenario something is not making contact, and once I apply pressure it then does, and it causes the phone to shut off. In the second scenario it must be making contact before the phone is turned on, and once I release it the loss of contact is causing it to shut off.\n\n[Here is a video displaying the issue](https://imgur.com/a/FSuDJt9), does anyone know what could be causing this?

    "selftext": "I want to share an extremely disappointing experience with Google Pixel support in India and seek guidance from the community on how to escalate this to the correct Grievance Officer as required under the Consumer Protection rules.\n\nThis started with a simple request to replace an original Pixel case that began peeling. What followed has been a draining and unnecessary struggle that no customer should have to go through:\n\n* Endless back and forth asking for the same information again and again even after submitting valid proof\n* Support insisted on Google Maps based address verification which is one sided and unrealistic in India and I had to go through the process of getting my address added to Maps just to move forward\n* Replacement was withheld because of a rigid policy that they will ship the new item only after they physically receive the old one which puts the entire waiting time and inconvenience on the customer\n* Shipment got stuck in transit for days with zero ownership taken by support and everything kept getting delayed\n* No coordination or accountability across support agents social media responses and email teams and no one took end to end responsibility\n* After all this stress the replacement that finally arrived was in the wrong color despite written confirmation from Google Support that it would match the original\n\nThis entire journey has been mentally exhausting and reflects a serious lack of customer centricity especially from a global brand that promotes quality and trust.\n\nTo escalate responsibly before going public, I also wrote to [**support-in@google.com**]() as the designated India support address but received no response at all. What is even more concerning is that I requested the official Grievance Officer contact details multiple times which customers in India are legally entitled to under the Consumer Protection Act and the request was continuously ignored.\n\nAt this point I am posting this for two reasons:\n\n1. So others are aware of what kind of support to expect if their Pixel accessory goes bad in India\n2. To request guidance from anyone who has successfully escalated a case to Google India’s Grievance Officer for consumer issues\n\nIf anyone has the correct and official contact details of the Grievance Officer for Google India or a working escalation path that actually responds please share it. It will help ensure that this situation is handled properly and hopefully prevent other consumers from going through the same ordeal.\n\nNo customer should be pushed through such a painful process for a basic replacement. I hope this helps drive some awareness and pushes for better accountability.",

I'm still baffled that google maps doesn't prompt my next calendar event when Waze does without a hitch?\n\nApple has copped alot of flack for their AI achievements but I personally never had any issues with doing any of the above tasks with Siri along with messaging tasks on various apps or weather questions. \n\nUnless I'm doing a google search question or finding out what the weather will be like., it's near useless as a \"assistant\". \n\nAm I alone here? Am I speaking to it incorrectly or is Gemini literally that detached, slow and clunky in comparison to Siri? ",

    "selftext": "I'm posting this because I spent weeks going absolutely mad trying to fix persistent Wi-Fi connectivity issues with my new Google Pixel 9 (this probably applies to the other series too). The connection was constantly dropping, or just refusing to connect to my home network. \n\nSome of my friends networks, or at the gym connected just fine. \n\n​I went through all the standard troubleshooting with Google Support: safe mode, network resets, factory resets... nothing worked. Eventually I had to send my phone for repair to the Google store , they determined there was a connectivity issue. But couldn't fix the phone because there were \"no spare parts\" for my model (weird, I know) and sent me a new Pixel 9.\n\n​Guess what? The exact same problems persisted.\n\n​That's when I realised the problem wasn't the phone; it was my older router. Modern phones like the Pixel sometimes have conflicts with certain older Wi-Fi defaults. After digging deep into the router settings by screenshotting them and pasting them into gemini asking what settings would be best for my pixel 9.\n\nI found a few key adjustments that completely fixed the issue and gave a solid Wi-Fi connection. \n\n\n​Setting Recommended for 2.4ghz\n\nChannel Bandwidth: Change from \"20/40\" or \"Auto\" to 20 MHz.\nMode: Change from \"11n Only\" to Mixed Mode (11b+11g+11n).\nChannel: Change from \"Auto\" or a high number (e.g., 13) to 1, 6, or 11.\nAPSD: Capable (Power Saving) Change from \"Enable\" to Disable.\n\nSetting Recommended for 5ghz\n\nMode: Ensure 802.11ac is enabled (e.g., \"Mixed 11a+11n+11ac\").\n\nChannel Bandwidth: Keep the highest option like 80 MHz or \"Auto 40/80 MHz\".\n\nBand Steering: If present, Disable it.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Welcome to the Battery Megathread, where you can find information and get assistance with any battery-related issues your Pixel might be facing. *All battery-related posts made outside this megathread will be removed.*\n\nBefore you make a comment, try these troubleshooting tips:\n\n###Stay up to date with the latest version of Android and your apps.\nAlthough some people may argue that a system update ruined their battery life (and occasionally this is the cause), it's always a good idea to make sure you device is running the latest version of Android (check anytime in Settings > System > Advanced > System update > Check for update). Security patches and major updates bring fixes not only for battery-draining bugs, but also protection against viruses and malware that may be stealing your charge, or worse. Individual app updates may also provide performance improvements to your battery.\n\n###Check for power-hungry apps.\nDespite battery-saving features like [Doze](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html), some apps may still be able to drain away your charge undetected. Try the following steps to identify any power-hungry apps.\n\n* Make sure that the \"Apps consuming battery\" notification is enabled, and wait a few minutes to see if it appears. (Find the toggle in Settings > Apps & notifications > See all ___ apps > More options (the triple dot) > Show system > Android system > Notifications > Other)\n* Check the battery usage of your apps in Settings > Battery > More options (the triple dot) > Battery usage. Remember that battery life may be reduced with usage of certain features (location, Bluetooth, etc.) and apps (gaming, video, etc.).\n* Turn on battery optimizations for all apps, (Under Settings > Apps & notifications > Advanced > Special app access > Battery optimization, and tap each app to change it to *Optimize*), and also enable Adaptive Battery, which limits rarely used apps (Under Settings > Battery > Adaptive Battery).\n* Force stop or uninstall any new apps and monitor battery life. (You can do this by going into Settings > search for *appName* & select *appName*)\n* Temporarily disable all installed apps with Safe Mode, to see if an existing/updated app is the problem. (Enter Safe Mode by pressing & holding the power button, and then pressing and holding *Restart*, and finally tapping OK. To exit Safe Mode, restart your phone as normal. You may have to sign into some apps again.) If your battery life improves, use the aforementioned methods on older apps.\n\n###Investigate battery intensive features.\nSome functions on you phone may use more power than you expect, especially in different scenarios. Take a look at this list for **a few** possibilities:\n\n* **Bluetooth** is notorious for its high-energy usage, especially when actively transferring data. Turn it off if it's not needed, and if you do, consider looking for Bluetooth Low Energy devices, which need much less power.\n* **Location** also uses quite a bit in order to pinpoint your position. Turn off Wifi/Cellular data/Bluetooth location accuracy (Settings > Security and Location > Location > Advanced > Battery saving > Google Location Accuracy) or turn Location off completely.\n* **Cellular** can also drain your battery when the signal is weak. At these times, more electricity is needed to stay connected, no matter if you're in the forest or underground. If you don't require a cellular connection (for example, if you have Wifi Calling), put your phone into Airplane mode and re-enable Wifi/Bluetooth if needed.\n\n###Contact Google Support.\nGoogle's dedicated Pixel support team may be able to help diagnose and fix your issue. Find them in Settings > Tips & Support, or just ask your Google Assistant \"troubleshoot my battery\".\n\n###IF ALL ELSE FAILS, factory reset your phone.\nSometimes wiping your phone is all that's needed to bring your battery back to life. Google Drive and Google Photos do a decent job with keeping your apps and data (check in Settings > Google > Backup > Back up now **and check** Google Photos > sidebar (the three lines) > Settings > Backup and sync), but ***please personally make sure that everything is backed up to something off your phone.*** To wipe your phone, [follow the steps here.](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4596836)\n\n*This megathread will be replaced on the 1^st of each month at 10:00 UTC.

But 9pro is much cheaper even than basic 10.\n\nI dont want to go full throttle into Android now, maybe I don’t like it, who knows.

    "selftext": "I just switched from my iPhone 15+ to the pixel 10 pro xl and man I should've done this sooner. I've been on iOS for the last 10 years and damn, android has came a long way in that time. \n\nI saw benchmarks and all the people trashing the pixels performance. I don't play mobile games so that doesn't mean anything to me. For email, reddit, online shopping talk and text this phone doesn't feel any slower than my 15+. \n\nGoing to a 120hz screen is crazy, I've never had one before and the difference is huge. Everything feels so much smoother when scrolling. \n\nThe screen is great, it gets bright as hell and everything looks great on it, the keyboard is infinitely better than iOS, notifications are handled way better. \n\nThe camera to me is way better. I can easily point and shoot and get a quality picture with this phone. Video recording looks better on the iPhone but not a ton better to my old color blind eyes. \n\nI got the mint mobile deal, $847 with tax for the 256gb pixel 10 pro xl and a year of unlimited service. They gave me $375 for my iPhone so I really can't complain. \n\nI'm still figuring some android stuff out but as of now I can't complain about the phone at all",

    "selftext": "A couple weeks ago and out of nowhere,  my phone decided it didn't want to recognize the sim card. Rebooted it, which did work, but would soon lose connection to sim again (usually within minutes). \n\nContacted Google support who confirmed a hardware issue and gave 3 options. (Perform a factory reset, send for repair or get replacement). Tried the factory reset that day, but didn't fix the problem. Called Google support the following day and asked for a replacement. That's when the support team rep said they encountered an error since my phone was purchased through third party (it was through Telus - large Canadian telecom company). Was asked to send over service agreement, which I did right away. Telus is an authorized dealer, so no issues there\n\nIt's been now a week and Google is still unable to send me the link to order my replacement phone. \n\nAlso, the phone is getting worse by the day. \n\n-Front screen becomes unresponsive sometimes, open to the dual screen and that works. Had to boot in safe mode to get front screen working again\n\n-huge lag when unfolding to dual screen and back to front screen,  where screen remains black. Have to push power button for it to respond\n\n-phone intermittently powers off. Won't turn back on with power button. Had to plug into charger and wait 15 minutes and then powered on (battery was well above 50%)\n\n-random screen flickers and audio issues. Then powers off on its own\n\nI've owned pixel phones since OG pixel. I own a business with 10 phone lines (many of them pixel phones). I even got my kids and wife on the pixel train\n\nBut, after enduring minor issues with every single pixel phone, this current issue is really making me question my loyalty to Google devices.  \n\nIt's not even the issues that's the main problem for me. The fact it's been 1.5 weeks and they can't even figure out how to send the link to order my replacement is ridiculous. \n\nThat's my rant. I hope this post helps others going through similar issue with their device.",

I've tried everything. Contacted my communications provider and they said it's not on their end. I put my SIM into another phone and confirmed the issue is to do with my device.\n\nI contacted Google Support who ran me through a myriad of troubleshooting steps in my settings to no success. Instead of being able to open a ticket all they advised to do was \"Submit Feedback\" through the phone app and describe my issue. Disappointing. I've done this 5 times now and nothing's happened.\n\nVery frustrating as I basically haven't had caller ID for 2 months now, have no idea who's calling me and if I miss a call and the person doesn't leave a voicemail I have no idea who to call back. Spam protection also seems to have stopped working as I'm getting tons more spam and robo calls since the issue started.\n\nI've been a Pixel user since the 3 and have generally been happy with the devices. It seems like I'm out of options now other than getting a new phone.\n\nHas anyone had this issue and any ideas how to resolve?",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

I really wish I could've found a good reason to keep it because I loved the flip factor, I can run with it and go hiking without feeling a big bulk bouncing around in my pocket. My main complaints were the short battery life and longer time to charge, camera quality, and phone temperature during regular use/charging (it gets really warm on the outter screen). Maybe sometime in the future Samsung will bring the Z series closer to the ultra given their higher pricing. ",

    "title": "My long-term experience with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra (and why I still love it)",
    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

But one man, unable to secure a ticket, found a hilariously unconventional way to enjoy the show from the comfort of his own balcony.\n\n>From his high-rise residence, the man had a direct line of sight to the distant festival grounds using his phone's powerful zoom (Instagram/brianredefine)\n\n>Instagram user Brian shared a now-viral video showing what, at first glance, looked like a grainy, low-quality stream of a Lollapalooza stage. The caption read: \"When you can't go to Lollapalooza but have a Samsung.\"\n\n>As the video begins, viewers can barely make out the performers on stage as American singer Dominic Fike performs. Then, in a moment of surprise, Brian zooms out, revealing that he was actually filming the festival from kilometres away, across a sprawling view of Chicago’s skyline.\n\n>From his high-rise residence, he had a direct line of sight to the distant festival grounds, and his Samsung’s powerful zoom brought the far-off stage into view. The sudden reveal had many viewers doing a double-take.",

    "selftext": "I’ve never been a big fan of Samsung electronics. Didn’t have anything against them per se, but I just wasn’t often impressed by them. I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Samsung did a lot of good with this phone. Like a lot. They made the cover screen a lot better than what it used to be, and I can do and see a lot more because of that. They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

    "title": "Samsung galaxy s25 edge 1 month review - Underrated",
    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

It doesn't even measure it at times and does not even detect if I'm wearing it.\n\nECG is straight up garbage now, the sensors on the buttons are cooked and it starts recording before I even place my finger and there's way too much noise to extract any conceivable data from the already lackluster single lead measurement.                                                                                           \n\n  \nSo what made me realise this ? For a change I started wearing my father's 4+ year old Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and I was surprised how fast the sensors started to react, heart rate and resting HR is on point compared to medical instruments and ECG has way less noise.\n\nBoth (GW7 and Ultra) watches used to super accurate, I have no idea whats going on with it now, GW7 is on the last OneUI 6.0 update while GWU is on the latest 8. Anyone else experiencing the same ? Could it be that the sensors are degrading on its own ? (if thats even possible).",

Seriously,You either have to make a playlist on your phone or listen to whatever random playlists YouTube throws at you.\n\nThen there is this super weird bug where, after 2 or 3 songs, the audio just stops. Shows that it's playing in the app, but there's no sound.\n\nDevice interconnectivity is a fking joke.Spotify switches seamlessly between devices,YouTube Music just everything manual, breaks the flow every single time..",

I've been waking up two alarms and trying to turn them off through muscle memory while I'm asleep, which in turn leads to me accidentally dialing emergency services at 6:00 a.m. when I'm just trying to wake up. This is happening maybe at least once a week if not more. Is there a way to either swap the buttons so I don't accidentally dial 911 every morning as a wake-up call, or is there to swap the function of the back button and the home button press?",

This post isn't for you. \nBut if you weren't aware: The Galaxy 8 is marketed to parents as an alternative to the Apple watch for a standalone connected device alternative to a cell phone. \nSearch  \"Galaxy Watch for Kids\" to find their page and the information they are advertising to parents.\n\nEVERY PART of getting Samsung Galaxy watches for our 2 kids as alternatives to cell phones had been one enormous trial after another. \nIt took days to get them set up and working on Verizon. BTW you cannot set up kids mode without a Samsung phone... And even then the process sucks. \nThe connectivity has been spotty AF, even outside and we live in Northern Chicago area with excellent coverage. \nThe last straw was when the 8yo accidentally left their watch at school but wasn't sure exactly when/where it might be. And the Find Hub placed it repeatedly at a coffee shop over a mile away. Leading us to believe it has been taken away from school by another child (not necessarily theft per semester). \n\nIt turned out to have stayed at school. \n\nLocation tracking that repeatedly updates to a place over a mile away is not acceptable for something explicitly intended to help parents have a modicum of ability to know where their kids might be in the event of an urgent situation or simply to check  in on their travels on public transit. \n\n[Edit] and it wouldn't be acceptable for an adult away from their phone either.

    "selftext": "Hello guys!   \nI know there's a lot of those topics, but it seems that my case is a bit different.   \n  \nSo this January I bought brand new GW5pro  (manufactured at the end of 2023)  from a local chain - updated it to the latest firmware  at the time and used it happily, getting at least 60h of battery life (72 in better days)  with no restrictions, using it like a smart watch - bunch of notifications, constant pulse tracking, GPS activities like running or bicycle, gym exercise tracking, sleep tracking. I used mostly stock apps and watch faces, aside from Spotify maybe. \n\nThen, at the end of September at some point it died on me unexpectedly - clocking in less than 24h from full charge, and battery never got as good as before ever since. \n\nI did all the obvious stuff - cleared cache, done a reset, updated and reinstalled everything, set it up from scratch without restoring backup.  Since it's still under warranty - I reached to the Samsung service, 3 times in total. First they diagnosed it and done a full reset - issue remained. Then I returned it to the store, they sent it to the same Service Center, for them to do another reset, with no result. \n\nThen I reached out to local Samsung support, and they advised to take it back to the service once more - then, when service diagnosed it yet again ('no issues found') - I pressed with my story, and as a part of keeping me loyal, they changes the watch battery and a back plate, returning it to me with stock firmware (one ui 4.5) - I updated it again, and guess what? The watch barely hangs for 30hours from charge to charge. \n\nNothing has changes in my use patterns, no 3rd party apps (aside from Spotify occasionally) were draining battery. My phone (s24U) is doing perfectly fine while the watch does this BS. \n\n*TLDR: Bought a new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro with great battery life (60-72 hours). In September, it suddenly dropped to under 24 hours. Despite multiple resets and a warranty repair where Samsung replaced the battery, the problem persists, now lasting only about 30 hours. No changes in usage patterns.*\n\nThank you for everyone who got this through.  Any ideas on how to fix this? Maybe someone had similar issues? ",

For example, if I open the heart rate app on the watch and scroll to the bottom and click the “show on phone” button, it gives an error saying “couldn’t open Samsung health on phone” with a question mark next to the Bluetooth icon in the middle of watch icon and phone icon- however the Bluetooth is definitely connected. \n\nTried all the different suggestions online, clear  cache / data for the app, reset the watch and reconnect, update all the softwares and firmwares, sync to Samsung account, etc. None of them worked. \n\nAny thoughts what could be wrong and how to fix it? Quite frustrating for not being able to make such a basic function to work. Thanks. ",

I'd had it for like 2ish years so I def got my money's worth and I def put a ton of miles on that little bezel, so I'm not surprised. I ordered a Watch 6 Classic (love that bezel, baby!) refurbished from Amazon, just like I did with my Watch 4. \n\nMy concern: I tried to spin the bezel on the Watch 6 Classic and it is significantly tighter. Like, I cannot spin with one finger like I did my old watch. I HAVE to use 2 or 3 fingers and press down a little (insert joke here). My question is, is that normal? Do I need to just wear it loose or is it a defect with the watch and I need to get a replacement? Is the too-tight a feature or a bug? \n\nTL;DR: Watch 6 Classic bezel is tighter than my wife, do I need a new one? ",

However, upon seeing it in person, I thought it was too bulky for me and my usage profile.\n\nSo even if the design is less attractive (for me obviously), I'm now considering Watch 8 (non LTE version). But I'm not reading very good things about the battery.\n\nI am mostly interested in health (ecg, sleep) and sports (mainly pool and open water swimming and running, 4-5 times a week) tracking. I already have had several smart watches and never used calling/messaging etc and never used AOD.\n\nMy question is, is there someone out there using the watch like this, more like a Garmin let's say (which I don't consider as an option because I don't like the designs and they're way more expensive here than W8)? What kind of battery life can I expect?\n\nAs I'm using a Huawei, which I charge like every 10 days or so I guess, charging daily would be a nightmare!\n\nThanks in advance..",

However when I did this, I found that I could no longer download any apps onto the watch. Whenever I go into the Galaxy Store on the watch, it just doesn't display any app results whatsoever- I click the recommended tab, 'no results'. I search for a specific app, 'no results'. Watch faces still appear when searched and can be downloaded, but no apps. I looked online, saw a tip to restart both devices, which I did to no help. Then another tip to factory reset the watch and connect it again, which again I did and it didn't help. I understand the watch is old but its worked absolutely fine connected to my old A54, so what changed? If anyone has the solution to this problem it would be appreciated. \n\nP.s. sorry the screenshots are in Polish, but it just essentially says 'no results' as I stated above.",

It doesn't even measure it at times and does not even detect if I'm wearing it.\n\nECG is straight up garbage now, the sensors on the buttons are cooked and it starts recording before I even place my finger and there's way too much noise to extract any conceivable data from the already lackluster single lead measurement.                                                                                           \n\n  \nSo what made me realise this ? For a change I started wearing my father's 4+ year old Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and I was surprised how fast the sensors started to react, heart rate and resting HR is on point compared to medical instruments and ECG has way less noise.\n\nBoth (GW7 and Ultra) watches used to super accurate, I have no idea whats going on with it now, GW7 is on the last OneUI 6.0 update while GWU is on the latest 8. Anyone else experiencing the same ? Could it be that the sensors are degrading on its own ? (if thats even possible).",

But when I cycle, the watch does the activity tracking on itself. Lately it's getting activated later than the 'normal' 10 minutes and it stops the activity while I'm still cycling (like between 20-30 minutes after the start of the activity tracking).\n\nDoes anybody else also have this problem? And how can I possibly fix this? Thanks in advance!",

Take breaks from your workout and take off your watch periodically to wipe off sweat or other irritants.\"\n\nThis is useless and annoying at the best of times, as it invariably comes as I'm driving home, where the loud *BONG* startles me and then leads to distracted driving as I start wondering if that was an important message. But lately, presumably since the update, I'm getting multiple copies of the same notification. I just cleared my third one.\n\nIt doesn't seem to obey the notification settings for Samsung Health, where I have notifications on but sound off. Not sure what other settings to look at.\n\nI would love to turn this notification off completely. I'd be satisfied if it just arrived without sound. At the absolute minimum I need to get it back down to just a single annoying notification. Ideas?",

    "selftext": "I recently upgraded from the Galaxy watch3 to the watch8 classic, And for the most part it has been a great experience. On the watch8 the home button and back button have swapped, which has been caused in a bit of issues, which I'm unable to fix because I can't figure out a way to swap them back to how it was on the old watch. I've been waking up two alarms and trying to turn them off through muscle memory while I'm asleep, which in turn leads to me accidentally dialing emergency services at 6:00 a.m. when I'm just trying to wake up. This is happening maybe at least once a week if not more. Is there a way to either swap the buttons so I don't accidentally dial 911 every morning as a wake-up call, or is there to swap the function of the back button and the home button press?",

It doesn't even measure it at times and does not even detect if I'm wearing it.\n\nECG is straight up garbage now, the sensors on the buttons are cooked and it starts recording before I even place my finger and there's way too much noise to extract any conceivable data from the already lackluster single lead measurement.                                                                                           \n\n  \nSo what made me realise this ? For a change I started wearing my father's 4+ year old Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and I was surprised how fast the sensors started to react, heart rate and resting HR is on point compared to medical instruments and ECG has way less noise.\n\nBoth (GW7 and Ultra) watches used to super accurate, I have no idea whats going on with it now, GW7 is on the last OneUI 6.0 update while GWU is on the latest 8. Anyone else experiencing the same ? Could it be that the sensors are degrading on its own ? (if thats even possible).",

Few of my friends recommended me to buy macbook air m4 since they said it provided a lot of useful tools for CS. But I do have some concerns of my own. The cheapest one is only 16GB RAM and 256GB storage and I think the internal storage is too small for the entire cs major. Should I maybe save up a bit to get the 512GB version? Or maybe shoud I get the 256GB one and buy an external ssd? (I'm very new to macbook, please helpp)\n\nAt the time, I also possess a gaming laptop (Helios Neo 16) for gaming purposes. I intend to use not use the gaming laptop for working and studying since the battery drains very quickly and its pretty heavy to bring around. Should I maybe sell it to try getting the m4 macbook pro? But I do wonder if it can handle my games (Like genshin impact, minecraft, palworld)\n\nOr maybe you guys know a windows laptop that is better for my budget and provides the same convenience as m4 macbook air? \n\n(Note: I would like to use the new laptop for the entire CS major)",

Both are similar in price\n\nThey are similar in specs, the only differences are\n1. battery\nAsus (75Wh) vs Lenovo 60 (Wh)\n2. ram\nBoth are 16 GB but Lenovo RAMs are upgradeable, ASUS soldered\n3. storage\nAsus (1 SSD slot) vs Lenovo (2 SSD slots)\n\nThinking of getting asus since the battery is bigger, but I think 16GB won't be sufficient for the next 5 years (saying this because I don't know much about laptops). And since Lenovo RAMs are upgradeable, so...\n\nBtw i use the laptop mainly for daily use and probably some medium gaming (i think 8845HS performance is enough to satisfy my gaming needs)\n\nIf there are other laptops to recommend, please do!!\nNeed guidance from the masters here please!! TIA\n\nEdit: i think the GPU VRAM on Lenovo can be adjusted to 4 GB, idk about asus",

However, during the process, the technician plugged in the US charger using an extension box without switching it off. This caused sparks, and part of the motherboard shorted due to reverse power flow.\n\nThe reverse power issue was later fixed, but ever since then, the laptop has stopped detecting new batteries. I've been using it only on direct power since then. Later, I bought a UPS to manage power fluctuations, but recently the UPS failed. Now my laptop is showing the error \"Hard Drive - self test unsuccessful, terminated\" during boot.\n\nI plan to get a new UPS, but I really want a permanent solution for the battery issue. I've tried contacting service centers, but they say they've attempted fixes and still can't get the laptop to recognize a battery. Is there any reliable solution to this problem?",

For reference, I mainly use my laptop for schoolwork and media consumption. The first issue is the battery life. I am having to charge my laptop 2-3 times a day, even without any media playback and with power saver on the entire time. It is especially bad when I am doing my job, which is primarily through Zoom. The battery goes from full to about 30% in about 2.5 hours, even with power saving mode on. Second, Bluetooth connectivity is not consistent. My Bluetooth earbuds pair fine one day, but the next, they won't connect. This is more of an inconvenience than anything else since I can always use wired headphones. The third issue is media playback. I have been having an issue where YouTube videos lag severely behind the audio component. I haven't really tested it without headphones or on other types of videos, but the problem persists even when I restart my laptop. I have been trying to keep using the laptop and just deal with the battery issue since it isn't that old, but the problems are now piling up. Any thoughts? I could replace the battery, but I doubt that would fix any of the other issues.",

    "selftext": "Someone at Lenovo thought it would be a smart idea to make a laptop that combines one of the most powerful laptop processors in the world ( Intel Ultra 9185HX ), with the weakest last-gen GPU from NVIDIA ( RTX 4050 ).\n\nSo now it works brilliantly for 4K video editing, and that's it. Anything else, CAD, blender, 3d design, gaming just has the GPU running at anywhere from 80-100% (mostly 100), while the CPU just sits in the corner doing little to no work.\n\nI reckon Lenovo realized this, so they designed a brilliantly effective vapor cooling system for the graphics card - which sits at a very respectable 75 degrees Celsius under heavy load - and left the two metal fans to cool the CPU, thinking no one would use it to its full potential (which, to be honest is a valid idea considering its power), but if you try to put the CPU through a stress test, it rapidly rises in temperature. comfortably resting just above the boiling point of water. Mind you this is on a 6 month old laptop that has lived on a clean desk it whole life, so it is completely free from cat Gooch and other gunky stuff in the fans.\n\nSo tell me, what do you do with a boiling CPU while rendering a 20 minute 4k video?\n\nPS: This laptop has a 3.2k display so that puts even more strain on the GPU while doing anything really.\n\nBut it does have 32GB of DDR5 7400, so it's definitely not sluggish.",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,  \nThis is my first post here, so go easy on me 😅. I wanted to share my full journey fixing the screen on my **Alienware x14 R1**, because I learned the hard way that not every issue needs a full screen replacement.\n\nIf your screen is black or flickering, don’t panic — there’s a good chance it’s just the **display ribbon cable** that runs through the hinge. The hinge design on this model isn’t the best; it bends that cable over time until it snaps or frays.\n\n# 🧭 Before You Start — Make a Choice\n\nIf you’re planning to fix this yourself, here are your two main options:\n\n# 🧩 Option 1: Replace the Display Cable First (Recommended to Try First)\n\n* Cost: around **$30–$40**\n* Difficulty: Moderate (you’ll open the hinge and bezel)\n* Risk: Possible cracked screen if you rush or pry too hard\n* Benefit: Saves you $300+ if it works\n\nIf your laptop still shows output on an **external monitor via USB-C** (not HDMI), there’s a strong chance your screen is fine and it’s only the cable. Try this first.\n\n# 💡 Option 2: Replace the Whole Screen Assembly (with White Housing)\n\n* Cost: around **$350–$400**\n* Difficulty: Easier to install\n* Benefit: No need to mess with old adhesive, ribbon placement, or cracked screen risk\n* Downside: Way more expensive\n\nIf your screen is already cracked or dead, or you just don’t want to gamble on cable replacement, go with this.\n\n# 🧰 What I Ordered & Used\n\n**From Newegg:**\n\n* Replacement Ribbon Cable – [Newegg link](https://www.newegg.com/p/36M-01NY-00006?item=9SIAX4CKKE4980)\n* Replacement Screen Panel (no housing) – [Newegg link](https://www.newegg.com/p/3B8-00B0-01865?item=9SIBVRDKCN3402)\n\n**From Walmart:**\n\n* Tool Kit: [Hyper Tough 77-Piece Precision Set](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Tough-77-Piece-Precision-Tool-Kit-with-Magnetic-Screwdriver-Standard-Size-Bits-and-Case-New-Condition/909383908) — comes with magnetic screwdrivers, tweezers, and prying tools.\n\n**From Amazon:**\n\n* Adhesive Tape for Laptop Screens – [BOHUIZ Stretch Display Adhesive](https://www.amazon.com/BOHUIZ-Display-Replacement-Stretch-Adhesive/dp/B0F2J6NMHK) — used this to mount my new screen since the factory tape was weak and uneven.\n\n# 🪛 Step-by-Step (Cable Replacement Path)\n\nHere’s how I replaced my cable before deciding whether I even needed a new screen:\n\n1. **Disconnect the Battery Cable**\n   * Always first. Flip the laptop over, unscrew the bottom, and carefully unplug the battery.\n2. **Slide Out the Bottom White Panel (Near the Hinge)**\n   * This slides out to expose your display and other connectors.\n3. **Unplug the Display Cable from the Motherboard**\n   * It’s under a tiny plate with two screws. Remove the plate and gently disconnect the ribbon.\n4. **Remove the Hinge Screws**\n   * You’ll need to loosen them to create more space to move the ribbon cable.\n5. **Take Off the Black Front Bezel**\n   * The bezel with “Alienware” printed on it pops off carefully using plastic prying tools. Don’t rush; it’s fragile.\n6. **Fold Back the Black Protective Sleeve**\n   * You’ll see this under the bezel. It covers and protects the ribbon connector going to the screen. Fold it back gently.\n7. **Connect the New Cable**\n   * Align and press it in until you feel or hear a small click. Don’t press hard — the screen is very thin and can crack easily.\n8. **Reconnect Everything (But Don’t Seal Yet)**\n   * Before reassembling, connect the battery and power on to test.\n   * If the screen turns on, congrats — your $30 cable fix worked!\n9. **If It Still Doesn’t Work**\n   * It’s likely your display itself is dead. You can now safely move to **Option 2** — full-screen replacement.\n\n# 🪞 Full Screen Replacement Notes\n\nIf you go with a new screen, decide if you want:\n\n* **Screen only (no housing)** — \\~$125 (what I bought).\n   * You’ll need to reuse your adhesive and be extra careful when aligning the ribbon.\n* **Screen + white housing** — \\~$350–$400.\n   * Much safer, because it already includes the mount and adhesive — basically plug and play.\n\nI tried to replace just the panel and ended up cracking it while prying. The adhesive on mine was *super strong* and brittle. I later learned these use **stretch-release adhesive strips** that can be pulled out cleanly if you know they’re there, but mine snapped instantly from age.\n\nIf you get the bare panel, use **new tape like the BOHUIZ**. Clean the frame, check fit, and don’t stick it until the display test passes.\n\n# ⚠️ Pro Tips & Warnings\n\n* Always disconnect the battery before plugging or unplugging anything.\n* Never use metal prying tools — they’ll chip the glass.\n* If you’re using only the screen, place an **A4 sheet of paper** between the laptop and screen while closing it to avoid pulling of attached cable, or you can just use non-sticky tape around the screen for testing, and once it's done, you can pull the sticky tabs for a permanent fix.\n* If your laptop works fine via USB-C output, replace the **cable first** — that’s the most common issue.\n* If you’re doing the full screen, make sure the ribbon sits flat and doesn’t pinch in the hinge area again.\n\n# 💰 Cost Comparison\n\n|Option|What You Replace|Cost|Difficulty|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Cable Only|Ribbon Cable|$30–$40|Moderate|\n|Screen Only|LCD Panel|$125|High|\n|Screen + Housing|Full Assembly|$350–$400|Easy|\n|Tools + Tape|Optional extras|\\~$30|—|\n\nMy total cost with trial and error was around **$185–$200**.\n\n# ✅ Final Thoughts\n\nAfter all the learning and mistakes, my Alienware x14 R1 is finally back to life. If I could go back, I’d say this:\n\n>\n\nEither way, you can absolutely do this at home with patience, plastic tools, and some decent lighting.\n\nGood luck to anyone trying this — feel free to ask me if you’re stuck mid-repair. I know how it feels 😅.",

    "selftext": "I am writing this as a warning to anyone considering purchasing a high-end HP Omen laptop. My experience with a new $2000 OMEN MAX 16 has been a complete failure from logistics to hardware to customer support.\n\n1. Lost in Transit: The first laptop I ordered was lost by FedEx due to a clear misdelivery with contradictory proof. It took weeks to resolve this with HP in the US before they finally agreed to ship a replacement.\n\n2. Dead in 4 Days: The replacement unit worked perfectly for just four days. Then, while gaming, it suddenly and permanently died. It is now a completely unresponsive brick. This wasn't random—it's a known, systemic design flaw with the 2023+ Omen 16 motherboards.\n\n3. The \"Global Warranty\" Runaround in India: Here is where it gets truly frustrating. My laptop has an active international warranty.\n\nFirst, I was rejected by the official HP service center in Nehru Place, who sent me to another center in Jasola Vihar.\n\nThe Jasola Vihar center also refused to service it, claiming they couldn't work on an international model.\n\nCalls to the  line were a mess of contradictions. One agent said parts were unavailable and no engineer could visit. Another scheduled a visit.\n\nAn engineer finally came to my home on Oct 25, confirmed the power failure, and took the laptop with him to the service center to expedite the repair.\n\nThe Current Impasse: My laptop is still with the HP engineer. The repair is indefinitely stalled because the US motherboard's internal \"CT number\" doesn't match the parts available in India. The engineer is \"trying to acquire\" the part, but it's clear there is no real process for this. My laptop is being held hostage by an internal policy.\n\nHP's \"Global Warranty\" is meaningless if your own service centers refuse to honor it. I have a defective-by-design, premium laptop, and the company is hiding behind logistics and part numbers instead of taking responsibility.",

It’s powerful enough to run my programs but is giant and heavy. \n\nHere are my rankings of laptop needs in order: 1) power (able to run the programs I need), 2) portability (backpack-friendly), and 3) price. \n\nBig plus if it’s going on sale for the holidays. \n\nThank you!",

Also MacBooks are very rare in my uni so all of the tutorials will be tailored to windows users and I’m not sure if the programs that i will have to use will even run on Mac, to be fair tho, I do have an old windows pc at home so I can maybe use that for assignments and such?

    "selftext": "So I am new CS student here. I currently have a budget around 1000$ for a new laptop. Few of my friends recommended me to buy macbook air m4 since they said it provided a lot of useful tools for CS. But I do have some concerns of my own. The cheapest one is only 16GB RAM and 256GB storage and I think the internal storage is too small for the entire cs major. Should I maybe save up a bit to get the 512GB version? Or maybe shoud I get the 256GB one and buy an external ssd? (I'm very new to macbook, please helpp)\n\nAt the time, I also possess a gaming laptop (Helios Neo 16) for gaming purposes. I intend to use not use the gaming laptop for working and studying since the battery drains very quickly and its pretty heavy to bring around. Should I maybe sell it to try getting the m4 macbook pro? But I do wonder if it can handle my games (Like genshin impact, minecraft, palworld)\n\nOr maybe you guys know a windows laptop that is better for my budget and provides the same convenience as m4 macbook air? \n\n(Note: I would like to use the new laptop for the entire CS major)",

Both are similar in price\n\nThey are similar in specs, the only differences are\n1. battery\nAsus (75Wh) vs Lenovo 60 (Wh)\n2. ram\nBoth are 16 GB but Lenovo RAMs are upgradeable, ASUS soldered\n3. storage\nAsus (1 SSD slot) vs Lenovo (2 SSD slots)\n\nThinking of getting asus since the battery is bigger, but I think 16GB won't be sufficient for the next 5 years (saying this because I don't know much about laptops). And since Lenovo RAMs are upgradeable, so...\n\nBtw i use the laptop mainly for daily use and probably some medium gaming (i think 8845HS performance is enough to satisfy my gaming needs)\n\nIf there are other laptops to recommend, please do!!\nNeed guidance from the masters here please!! TIA\n\nEdit: i think the GPU VRAM on Lenovo can be adjusted to 4 GB, idk about asus",

I don’t really need all the power or the fancy OLED touchscreen — it’s nice, but not essential.

I’ve thought about getting a Mac but the main problem is that if I buy the M4, I would have to get the 256gb version and I just don’t think that enough but also I don’t have enough to upgrade to the 512gb. Also MacBooks are very rare in my uni so all of the tutorials will be tailored to windows users and I’m not sure if the programs that i will have to use will even run on Mac, to be fair tho, I do have an old windows pc at home so I can maybe use that for assignments and such?

Or would it be better to get 1x8TB and 2x4TB to free up a slot? Also, which slots are the ones that share PCI-e lanes with the GPU? So I know which ones to avoid if it turns out to be a problem.",

I can get either for about the same price.\n\nMy favourite games include Arma, Squad (main game), HLL, Total War games. I know squad and Arma are CPU heavy and like the x3d CPU’s however I am aware for overall 1440p the 9070xt build is the better. \n\nMy main thoughts are I am aware the 5070 12gb VRAM may not be the most future proof for 1440p however would the 5070 option be better as if I had to upgrade GPU in 4/5 years the 7800x3d is still likely to be a strong CPU especially for 1440p so I’m not running the risk of significant bottle necking and having to upgrade GPU and CPU at the same time. Where as if I went for the 9070xt build if I wanted to upgrade GPU in the future I would also likely need to upgrade the CPU at the same time to avoid a significant CPU bottleneck.\n\nWould be interested in some peoples opinions?",

If I wait for a while, like in Warframe for example, I had to wait about 5 minutes with the CPU at 100% and 100 degrees, after that the computer goes back to normal usage, around 20 to 40% for most games I play.\n\nI want to know if this could be harmful to my computer and if there’s any way to fix it in case it is. It doesn’t happen with every game, and it only happens the first time I launch them. I think it might be compiling shaders or something like that, because after that it runs normally every time I open it again.",

    "selftext": "So I have built my first pc in August but until now I've been saving and on integrated graphics therefore i did not need the gpu connectors so i didnt even bother to plug in pcie cables to the modular psu i use (msi mag a850gl). But now i have ordered a rx 6950xt of [amazon.de](http://amazon.de) (Im in Portugal and it was the best option within my budget that didnt have insane shipping time like 2-3months). So this GPU arrives next monday (November 3rd), and now i have finally connected those pesky PCIE cables but my PSU has 8 pins that split into 2 6+2's and i was scared that the power the rx 6950xt draws would be too much for the cables to handle, so i have connected 2 of these and plan to use one 6+2 from each. My question is **what the hell do i do with the unused second connector of each cable**? should i cover them with teflon tape or something? Anyway here's the build: [https://pt.pcpartpicker.com/user/TsukuPCs/saved/c7FTzy](https://pt.pcpartpicker.com/user/TsukuPCs/saved/c7FTzy)",

My budget is around 600 eur (can go higher if it's worth it) and I need pretty much everything apart from my 4070 (altho that one will get upgraded in the future too, just not yet) and a PSU. I definitely want an AMD CPU. I'm mainly wondering if it's better to get the 7th gen 9k or 9th gen 7k, what MB to pair it with and if there are any cooler recommendations. I think RAM and Case I'm pretty cabable of picking myself. Thank you very much in advance!",

Ive been looking but i cant decide. Some people suggest a Ultra wide 4k monitor for msfs. some suggest just a 1440p normal monitor. Curved for immersion but flat for fps games? IDK what to choose. Im planning on after getting the new preferably it being bigger. I have 40 inches of horizontal space but Im hoping to DIY my samsung into a vertical monitor by sawing off the stand and rotating it 90°. I dont have a set budget but maybe max high £100 to low £200s. Any suggestions? Im planning on changing out my lamp for one that hangs off the side of the desk so it doesnt take up room.",

    "selftext": "My son (19) has been using one of my old PCs for a few years and the time has come to beef it up. He’s a 2nd year CS student, he’s also into music, singing, producing soundtracks and video editing. Some gaming as well but generally not super demanding. He also has a M3 13” MacBook Air 512 GB.\n\nI have a spare SFF (ITX)  PC that I could use to update his config or I could convert to AM5.\n\nCurrent PC:\n- Intel core i5 9600k •\t⁠32 GB DDR4 3200\n- Asus ROG Strix Maximus XI Hero Z390 mobo\n- 1 x 128 nvme SSD, 1 x TB nvme SSD, 1 x 1 TB SATA SSD\n- EVGA RTX 2080 Ti XC Ultra\n- Corsair RM850x PSU\n- Corsair H100i AIO, 5 Lian Li fans\n- Lian Li Lancool II Mesh RGB case\n\nSpare SFF PC (only relevant parts):\n- Ryzen 7 3700X (spare Ryzen 9 5950X also available)\n- MSI B450i Gaming Plus AC mobo (also: spare Asus ROG Strix B450i Gaming), both ITX form factor\n- 32 GB DDR4 3200 (also: 32 GB DDR4 3600 in my daughter’s (12) PC that we could swap)\n\nThe first idea would be to update my son’s PC and get the 5950X in there as cheaply as possible.\n\nQuestions are:\n- are the ITX motherboards sufficient for the 5950X (particularly VRMs) or will they bottleneck it? Bios is updated on both\n- use one of ITX motherboards or buy another AM4 ATX motherboards? I have found a 2nd hand Asus Crossair VIII Dark Hero X570 for € 150, is it worth it to spend this amount and have an very good platform to run the 5950X? (see also next point)\n- RAM: if ITX motherboard, either 32 GB DDR4 3600 or buy a 2 x 32 GB DDR4 3600 pack. If ATX motherboard, either reuse 4 x 16 GB DDR4 3200 or use 32 DDR4 3600 &  buy another 32 DDR4 3600 if needed.\n- buy a 2TB nvme SSD and maybe a 4 TB SATA SSD (to have 2 TB system & apps, 1 TB scratch, 4 TB data & projects)\n- Fallback would be to use the 3700X, would it still be sufficient for his usage?\n\nGPU update may also come in not too distant future, thinking of a 5070 Ti during Black Friday if promotions are decent or wait the release of Super versions.\n\nDoes the above make sense or should we move to AM5 platform now?",

    "selftext": "My plan for next year is to get myself a desktop computer. Since I don't have high gaming performance requirements, after careful consideration, I've decided on either 3800x or 11600k.\n\nMy laptop's CPU is 11800H, but its actual performance isn't fully utilized due to poor tuning. In my usual setup with 60W CPU, the 11800H scores 560 for single-core and over 4700 for multi-core CPUs via CPU-Z. Multi-core score is similar to the 11600K, but single-core score is almost 10% lower. Given its good cache performance, its gaming performance should be similar to the 11600K, although the CPU-Z score might be slightly lower during gameplay due to insufficient cooling. And although the CPU-Z score doesn't represent absolute gaming performance, it can serve as a comparison.\n\nMy laptop's performance is already sufficient for me, so I can accept a slight performance reduction. I don't want PCIe 3.0 because I already have an SN7100. Also, 9th-11th i7 is too expensive, not worth buying, so I'm currently considering the 3800X, 11600K, and 3600XT. The 3800X + X570 and 11600K + Z590 are all around the same price range within my budget.\n\nI'm curious to know if a 6-core CPU is sufficient for streaming or screen sharing while playing games? Or do I must need an 8-core CPU to ensure performance doesn't drop significantly? The GPU will be 3060 12G.\n\nFor the Zen 2 and Sunny Cove architectures, will their performance still be sufficient in two or three years?",

But I’m 55 and started playing with computers and I was IBM 8088 or 86 I can’t remember oh my God anyway then we upgraded to 286 and then a 386 and wow that was insane. The only Internet out there was from the university of Manitoba at the time, it was $25 a year and they would send you a pay invoice and you would send the check-in. The sound card was more important than a video card because he just had there was no real graphics it was dumb, but not much. The Internet was just starting use the program called mosaic it was not much to serve. If there were no ads you’re more bulletin boards BBS as we called them. I used to run one called Flint‘s place. It was just to download software basically I ran five and I went to Windows 31 and then went to six was probably the worst Program ever made and went to Windows 311 which wasn’t bad actually and just kept going up from there and then a long comes to panty years and years later and everything started to haywire so you guys have it. Lucky with the technology now it is but it’s insane. I tell you I used to have a 20 MB hard drive and I thought I was the coolest thing in the world. An 8086 back then would run you around $7000 and Microsoft was just starting to play their shenanigans with the IBM. I totally remember that because you could buy IBM Dos or MS-DOS and all of a sudden IBM do disappeared and all of a sudden this MS do only it was weird and then windows came along and they tried a few other programs IVM it’s called warp. I think they even gave free copies away their latest upgrade, but it never took off is terrible and then of course everyone tried Lennox. I was gonna be the greatest thing but the graphics weren’t up to park compared to windows. And the windows you constantly got the blue screen to death so we called it back then. Anyway, just reminiscing here in the middle of the night thinking how much has changed sitting in my parents living room on this 808with a Monaco monitor that was worth 7000 bucks hard to believe for 700 but you can build now.\n\nThanks Pete PS.\n\nPS probably lots of mistakes as I’m using voice to text",

I know squad and Arma are CPU heavy and like the x3d CPU’s however I am aware for overall 1440p the 9070xt build is the better. \n\nMy main thoughts are I am aware the 5070 12gb VRAM may not be the most future proof for 1440p however would the 5070 option be better as if I had to upgrade GPU in 4/5 years the 7800x3d is still likely to be a strong CPU especially for 1440p so I’m not running the risk of significant bottle necking and having to upgrade GPU and CPU at the same time. Where as if I went for the 9070xt build if I wanted to upgrade GPU in the future I would also likely need to upgrade the CPU at the same time to avoid a significant CPU bottleneck.\n\nWould be interested in some peoples opinions?",

No price is listed for my video card, and I'm not sure if that means it's not on the market or if pcpartpicker just hasn't had the part's price shared with them. \n\nThe site says everything is compatible, but I want to be sure.

I'd have to reset the PC and lower all the graphics settings to prevent everything from crashing. \n\nI figured it's either the CPU throttling the GPU or the PSU not providing enough power to the GPU or the GPU is getting too hot and shutting down as a result. \n\nAnyway, long story short I've upgraded the PSU and the CPU and the PC seems to work fine. I have had it on a couple of days but not been able to play any games on it yet to see if I can increase the settings from medium graphics to high or ultra. \n\nYesterday I had a look to see if I could upgrade to Windows 11 and it recommended I change the boot setting to UEFI which I did in the Bios. I restarted the computer and it lasted about 1 min before the whole computer lost power and shut off. \n\nWhen I turn the computer on the fans start up, I can hear the HDD spinning up but the ram doesn't glow, I get no check lights in the motherboard and I get no picture on the monitors?? \n\nI'm guessing it's because I changed the boot setting? I've tried shorting the CLR_RTC pins but again when I plug the cable back into the PSU and power up the computer I still have the same issue? \n\nDoes anyone have any ideas that could help? ",

However, when I do this, the light will cycle between the CPU and DRAM lights and not fully boot. \n\nWhen I place the sticks of RAM in the B1 & B2 slots it will boot fully.  However, this means it isn't in dual channel, correct?\n\nI've tried every configuration possible and it's not seeming to work.  Any help would be much appreciated.  I'm unsure of which pieces could be the problem.",

They confirmed that both my old motherboard and CPU are fried.\n\nNow I’m torn on what to do next. Should I continue building under the LGA 1200 (Intel 10th Gen) platform, or switch over to AMD’s AM4 (Ryzen) platform?\n\nI already contacted the same store to see if they’d let me swap my new Intel board for an AM4 one, but the only option they offered was a Gigabyte B450M K for the same price.\n\nThe issue is that Intel 10th Gen CPUs are quite rare and expensive in my country, while Ryzen CPUs are much more common and offer better price-to-performance. Since I’m on a budget, I’m not sure which direction would be the smarter move — stick with Intel and find a brand new 10th Gen CPU (probably i5 10400), or swap my new board and move to Ryzen AM4.",

But I’m 55 and started playing with computers and I was IBM 8088 or 86 I can’t remember oh my God anyway then we upgraded to 286 and then a 386 and wow that was insane. The only Internet out there was from the university of Manitoba at the time, it was $25 a year and they would send you a pay invoice and you would send the check-in. The sound card was more important than a video card because he just had there was no real graphics it was dumb, but not much. The Internet was just starting use the program called mosaic it was not much to serve. If there were no ads you’re more bulletin boards BBS as we called them. I used to run one called Flint‘s place. It was just to download software basically I ran five and I went to Windows 31 and then went to six was probably the worst Program ever made and went to Windows 311 which wasn’t bad actually and just kept going up from there and then a long comes to panty years and years later and everything started to haywire so you guys have it. Lucky with the technology now it is but it’s insane. I tell you I used to have a 20 MB hard drive and I thought I was the coolest thing in the world. An 8086 back then would run you around $7000 and Microsoft was just starting to play their shenanigans with the IBM. I totally remember that because you could buy IBM Dos or MS-DOS and all of a sudden IBM do disappeared and all of a sudden this MS do only it was weird and then windows came along and they tried a few other programs IVM it’s called warp. I think they even gave free copies away their latest upgrade, but it never took off is terrible and then of course everyone tried Lennox. I was gonna be the greatest thing but the graphics weren’t up to park compared to windows. And the windows you constantly got the blue screen to death so we called it back then. Anyway, just reminiscing here in the middle of the night thinking how much has changed sitting in my parents living room on this 808with a Monaco monitor that was worth 7000 bucks hard to believe for 700 but you can build now.\n\nThanks Pete PS.\n\nPS probably lots of mistakes as I’m using voice to text",

Where as if I went for the 9070xt build if I wanted to upgrade GPU in the future I would also likely need to upgrade the CPU at the same time to avoid a significant CPU bottleneck.\n\nWould be interested in some peoples opinions?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I'm Hrvoje the CEO & Founder of Ironward - a small, independent studio from Croatia building strategy games.\n\nBack in high school, I was part of a team that started building an RTS-hybrid where players battle for world domination and ascend to godhood. The idea of me creating video games and impacting other people's lives the way games impacted mine bought me over instantly and I knew then and there that this would be my lifelong call. I wanted to make other people feel the joy and happiness that I felt playing my favorite games, and this game - early Atre - seemed like a perfect medium for that.\n\nBut, it was early 2000s, game development wasn't as huge as it is today, and we were young and new.\n\n\n\nTeam disbanded.\n\nLife moved on.\n\nI continued chasing my dream of developing games and founded Ironward. We released a few titles, all inspired by that original feeling that I felt when working on Atre in my highschool days. The games performed well, people supported us on our first Kickstarter campaign, and I was happy with how we were growing as a studio, but the game that ignited all of this was gathering dust somewhere, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that we have to find it and do something with it.\n\nDecades later, a dedicated fan who received the project from the initial developers reached out to me and, after confirming that I was indeed one of the guys working on the project back in the day, sent the original files of Atre. I couldn't believe it at first because I was absolutely convinced Atre was lost - after all, why would anyone spend time and effort maintaining an unfinished game for all these years? But it seems like he saw the same value and potential that I saw. \n\nI decided to bring it back to life - rebuilt the game from scratch on modern tech, with that same “massive magical battlefield” feel to it.\n\n  \n\n\nNow, 25 years later, and after years of reworking and adapting the project to meet today's standards, it’s finally alive and almost finished. We launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the last phase of the project. Our goal is to raise enough to be able to comfortably finish Atre and add all the polishing and content that we believe would enhance the game and establish it as a go-to title for anyone who loves high-fantasy strategy games.\n\nWe also have an active playtest running for which anyone can apply, and we are actively monitoring and listening to all player feedback because we want to build this game together with the community.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\\- Hrvoje\n\n(Kickstarter link’s in the comments - trying to keep this post clean.)",

    "selftext": "Recently I came across a video that compares game projects from different years in terms of immersion and the development of physical models. Very interesting comparison - I advise to watch the full video. And the point is that new titles are inferior to old games in almost everything except graphics, of course.\n\nIndeed, I remember how, back in the 2000s, my friends and I always looked first at the destructibility in FPS. The more objects on the map you could shoot, the more bullet marks you left on the walls, and the more parts you could dismember your enemies into - the better the game was. Photorealistic graphics faded into the background. And when Half-Life 2 released, where you could also drag and drop various objects around, our excitement knew no bounds.\n\nAnd the more I look at my Steam library, the more I see that photorealistic graphics don't help if the surrounding world, no matter how beautiful, doesn't react to the player.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way, and it's time for me to upgrade, or there's something really wrong with game development lately? What do you think?",

People can literally hack your PC and install malware if you just sit in the menu's on the older CODs. MW2019 uses a different engine and dedicated servers and there hasn't been any reports of RCE exploits on that COD or newer CODs. So it got me curious, if P2P CODs have RCE exploits, do older games that use P2P also have RCE exploits and are unsafe to play? ",

Think *Assemble With Care* meets *Trash Goblin* \\- but with resistors, LEDs, and a tiny hamster helping you fix things.\n\n[Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3587450/Crispy_Circuits/)\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-YcvKScI9Y)\n\nYou play as **Giddily**, an 11-year-old prodigy who helps neighbours repair gadgets while secretly working on her big project: restoring her hamster’s RC plane. Each puzzle is based on real electrical problems - like building a charger from scratch or regulating voltage... It's all powered by an actual [SPICE simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE), so circuits behave the way they would in real life.\n\nWe’re trying to make electronics *feel approachable and creative*, instead of intimidating. You can mess around, short-circuit things (safely!), and learn by doing.\n\nIt’s equal parts **STEM sandbox** and **cozy story game** \\- we are thinking of adding in lo-fi beats and already have pastel visuals, and a hamster named Crispy who occasionally powers your circuits with his wheel.\n\nWe’d love to hear what the PC gaming crowd thinks:\n\n* Do educational-but-cozy games like this appeal to you?\n* Would you rather see more structured challenges, or full sandbox freedom to experiment?\n\nAppreciate any feedback, especially from folks who would find themselves at the crossroads of:\n\n* Assemble With Care\n* Trash Goblin\n* Spirit City: Lofi Sessions\n* PC Building Simulator\n* Little Rocket Lab",

Rather than let it die, I'm making it open source in hopes that someone in the community will pick it up and continue development.\n\n**Looking for Maintainers:**\nI'm specifically looking for someone who wants to seriously take on the project and manage the public repository. If you're interested or want to discuss, join the Fuzion Discord - link to Discord in the repo readme.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/stomane/fuzion\n\nFeel free to fork it, fix it, improve it, or use it as a learning resource. The code is all yours now!\n\nThanks to everyone who used Fuzion over the years. Here's hoping it gets a second life in the hands of the community! 🙏",

    "title": "Why do so many people dislike the Epic Games Launcher’s UI? Am I missing something?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, hope you’re all doing good.\n\nSo I saw a post earlier where someone was asking whether to buy *Arc Raiders* on Epic or Steam. They ended up going with Steam, which is fair, but it reminded me how every time this topic comes up people go *“Steam’s better. Epic’s UI sucks.”*\n\nAnd I’m just curious, what *exactly* is it that people dislike so much about Epic’s UI?\n\nI use both pretty evenly, and honestly, they feel about the same to me. Most of what I do is:\n\n* Buy games\n* Read game pages / watch trailers\n* Launch games\n\nFor those things, both launchers get the job done. Epic even loads faster on my PC, Steam always does its little update check on startup, which takes a bit.\n\nWhen it comes to the library, I actually kinda prefer Epic’s layout. The quick launch tab and filters (like “installed only” or “recently added”) are super handy. Steam’s library always feels a bit cluttered unless I manually organize everything.\n\nThat said, Steam definitely wins once you click on a specific game, the playtime, achievements, screenshots, reviews, all that. Epic mostly just shows the title unless you go to the store page.\n\nStill, in day-to-day use, I just click *Play* or *Launch* and that’s it. Steam has Big Picture Mode and better controller input stuff, sure, but I don’t really use overlays or custom mappings anyway since my Xbox controller works fine in most games.\n\nSo yeah, for people who *really* dislike Epic’s launcher:  \n\\-What is it specifically that bothers you?  \n\\-Is it missing features like achievements/workshop/etc.?  \n\\-Or do you just find the design itself clunky or ugly?\n\nNot talking about the “I want all my games in one place” thing, that’s fair. I mean purely when people say Epic’s *UI/UX* is bad. What about it makes it bad to you?\n\n**TL;DR:** I use both Steam and Epic about the same and don’t see a big difference. What about Epic’s *UI* makes people dislike it so much?",

The new game is also completely broken and not playable \n\nIt feels like every new game that comes out is so broken and incomplete. I am hopeful that this will give some room and demand for a developer to make something really special that will have little to no competition \n\n",

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community: [https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

Yet all we hear is company XYZ cutting corners, firing staff, poor optimizations, $90 price tag etc. while somehow these companies are also still not making enough money?  \n  \nFor example, how was Infinity Ward/Activision able to make one of the greatest COD games MW2 in 16 months and run on a PS3 with 256mb ram near flawlessly, but I can’t even run Warzone smoothly on low settings on my fucking RTX5070 with 32gb RAM, and they’ve been actively developing/patching that garbage for like 5-7 years? Not to mention the fact they’ve milked revenue from that game the whole time through skins while MW2 was being patched for free.     \n  \n  \nIt sounds stupid, but did these companies forget about saving money by hiring talented people who can manage projects and create quality products within reasonable constraints, who understand limitations and can be creative to work around them? Why are studios hiring people who create garbage then spend a year(s) post production patching the game to make it playable? In the construction industry there’s a saying we use along the lines of, “If you have time to come back and fix it, you had time to do it right the first time.”. \n  \nBit of a rant but also a general curiosity on how this industry has completely evolved to something that doesn’t seem to understand what they’ve got their hands on. This seems like the best time to make unbelievable money and create amazing quality games and it just isn’t happening for some of these big names.\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n",

I think gaming rage comes from a lack of control. \n\nYou can control how YOU play. Your micro, macro, game sense, hero selection, strategy, mindset, etc.\n\nYou can't control what kinds of teammates you get queued up with, how they play, or the reliability of your internet/system. Notice how a lot of competitive games are labeled as \"toxic\"? Its because people are always blaming others.\n\nI can't think of a single time where I hard raged in a single player game. Why? Because I know that my perfomance is directly related the only variable; me. \n\nSorry for the yap. Was pooping on the toliet and just wanted to share my thoughts.\n\n",

No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt’s been a long road, but this one’s been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I'm Hrvoje the CEO & Founder of Ironward - a small, independent studio from Croatia building strategy games.\n\nBack in high school, I was part of a team that started building an RTS-hybrid where players battle for world domination and ascend to godhood. The idea of me creating video games and impacting other people's lives the way games impacted mine bought me over instantly and I knew then and there that this would be my lifelong call. I wanted to make other people feel the joy and happiness that I felt playing my favorite games, and this game - early Atre - seemed like a perfect medium for that.\n\nBut, it was early 2000s, game development wasn't as huge as it is today, and we were young and new.\n\n\n\nTeam disbanded.\n\nLife moved on.\n\nI continued chasing my dream of developing games and founded Ironward. We released a few titles, all inspired by that original feeling that I felt when working on Atre in my highschool days. The games performed well, people supported us on our first Kickstarter campaign, and I was happy with how we were growing as a studio, but the game that ignited all of this was gathering dust somewhere, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that we have to find it and do something with it.\n\nDecades later, a dedicated fan who received the project from the initial developers reached out to me and, after confirming that I was indeed one of the guys working on the project back in the day, sent the original files of Atre. I couldn't believe it at first because I was absolutely convinced Atre was lost - after all, why would anyone spend time and effort maintaining an unfinished game for all these years? But it seems like he saw the same value and potential that I saw. \n\nI decided to bring it back to life - rebuilt the game from scratch on modern tech, with that same “massive magical battlefield” feel to it.\n\n  \n\n\nNow, 25 years later, and after years of reworking and adapting the project to meet today's standards, it’s finally alive and almost finished. We launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the last phase of the project. Our goal is to raise enough to be able to comfortably finish Atre and add all the polishing and content that we believe would enhance the game and establish it as a go-to title for anyone who loves high-fantasy strategy games.\n\nWe also have an active playtest running for which anyone can apply, and we are actively monitoring and listening to all player feedback because we want to build this game together with the community.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\\- Hrvoje\n\n(Kickstarter link’s in the comments - trying to keep this post clean.)",

Each puzzle is based on real electrical problems - like building a charger from scratch or regulating voltage... It's all powered by an actual [SPICE simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE), so circuits behave the way they would in real life.\n\nWe’re trying to make electronics *feel approachable and creative*, instead of intimidating. You can mess around, short-circuit things (safely!), and learn by doing.\n\nIt’s equal parts **STEM sandbox** and **cozy story game** \\- we are thinking of adding in lo-fi beats and already have pastel visuals, and a hamster named Crispy who occasionally powers your circuits with his wheel.\n\nWe’d love to hear what the PC gaming crowd thinks:\n\n* Do educational-but-cozy games like this appeal to you?\n* Would you rather see more structured challenges, or full sandbox freedom to experiment?\n\nAppreciate any feedback, especially from folks who would find themselves at the crossroads of:\n\n* Assemble With Care\n* Trash Goblin\n* Spirit City: Lofi Sessions\n* PC Building Simulator\n* Little Rocket Lab",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I'm Hrvoje the CEO & Founder of Ironward - a small, independent studio from Croatia building strategy games.\n\nBack in high school, I was part of a team that started building an RTS-hybrid where players battle for world domination and ascend to godhood. The idea of me creating video games and impacting other people's lives the way games impacted mine bought me over instantly and I knew then and there that this would be my lifelong call. I wanted to make other people feel the joy and happiness that I felt playing my favorite games, and this game - early Atre - seemed like a perfect medium for that.\n\nBut, it was early 2000s, game development wasn't as huge as it is today, and we were young and new.\n\n\n\nTeam disbanded.\n\nLife moved on.\n\nI continued chasing my dream of developing games and founded Ironward. We released a few titles, all inspired by that original feeling that I felt when working on Atre in my highschool days. The games performed well, people supported us on our first Kickstarter campaign, and I was happy with how we were growing as a studio, but the game that ignited all of this was gathering dust somewhere, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that we have to find it and do something with it.\n\nDecades later, a dedicated fan who received the project from the initial developers reached out to me and, after confirming that I was indeed one of the guys working on the project back in the day, sent the original files of Atre. I couldn't believe it at first because I was absolutely convinced Atre was lost - after all, why would anyone spend time and effort maintaining an unfinished game for all these years? But it seems like he saw the same value and potential that I saw. \n\nI decided to bring it back to life - rebuilt the game from scratch on modern tech, with that same “massive magical battlefield” feel to it.\n\n  \n\n\nNow, 25 years later, and after years of reworking and adapting the project to meet today's standards, it’s finally alive and almost finished. We launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the last phase of the project. Our goal is to raise enough to be able to comfortably finish Atre and add all the polishing and content that we believe would enhance the game and establish it as a go-to title for anyone who loves high-fantasy strategy games.\n\nWe also have an active playtest running for which anyone can apply, and we are actively monitoring and listening to all player feedback because we want to build this game together with the community.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\\- Hrvoje\n\n(Kickstarter link’s in the comments - trying to keep this post clean.)",

    "selftext": "I have posted about this in r/laptops and r/GamingLaptops and got no responses. I also understand that laptop docks have their own quirks, and this may just be how it is, but I'm hoping it isn't.\n\nI have an Asus ROG Strix Scar 17 gaming laptop, and it works great, plays the games I want, no issues with the laptop itself. I have a basic, generic Dell laptop that I use for work, along with a Dell WD19S dock, and two basic 22\" Dell monitors, and a 27\" BenQ 4k monitor. \n\nWhen I plug in my work laptop, everything works as intended. The monitors are always connected and display the correct resolutions, etc. The background doesn't stay if I change it per monitor, but that isn't a huge deal as I don't really look at the background while working anyhow.\n\nThe issue is when I plug the gaming laptop into the dock. More often than not, one of the monitors will not turn on. I can go into the display settings, and the monitor will show connected, but I have to change the drop down menu to extend the display to that monitor, I have to do this nearly every time. I can also open the laptop lid, and all of the monitors will turn on, with one of them in a lower resolution. When I close the lid, the resolution will go back to the max preferred resolution, and all the monitors will stay on.\n\nOther times, like this morning, a different monitor wasn't turning on. Again, I could see it in the display settings, but when I tried to change the setting to 'extend desktop to this display' nothing would happen. I tried again, still nothing. I unplugged the DisplayPort cable and plugged it back in, no change. I opened the laptop lid, all the monitors turned on, with that same monitor in a lower resolution. I closed the lid, monitor turned off, I tried extending the desktop, nothing. I finally restarted with the laptop lid open, and everything worked when it came back on. I closed the lid, the main monitor was not on, but I was able to extend the desktop in the display settings.\n\nThis has been driving me insane, I do not understand why it works perfectly fine with my work laptop, but I have these issues with my gaming laptop. Is it because of the manufacturer differences? I have updated the dock drivers/firmware and nothing has changed. Is there a setting I'm missing? Is my life destined to changing settings every time I use my gaming laptop with a laptop dock? Are all docks really \\*this\\* bad? ",

Everyone says LG OLEDs offer the best possible image quality for gaming, but honestly, that magic hasn’t hit me yet. I don’t see *that* much difference between this TV and a good-quality, much cheaper one (like a Philips Ambilight, for example).\n\nRight now, I sometimes use **Game Optimizer** mode with **HGIG on** (which always looks too much darker), and sometimes **Filmmaker Mode** (brighter, but loses some of the visual punch).\n\nAnd then there’s **HDR**. Am I the only one who actually prefers playing *without* it? I mean, yeah, the image changes, but I’m not sure it’s for the better.\n\nWould love to hear how you guys set yours up and what modes or tweaks made the biggest difference for you.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/164s50actnyf1.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=276ef7f6c8042a603160ab02ab177269e7622689\n\n",

    "selftext": "My new $400 AM5 upgrade has been completely ruined by this one glitch that plagues me nearly every time I play Roblox, and for the life of me, I can’t figure out why! Trying to google it does no help because I can hardly describe it besides stuttering, and all the results are talking stuff like “I can’t get good FPS!”, but this is way worse than that.\n\nI notice this happens in Roblox, but not the couple other games I play. Roblox plays perfectly fine for some time, and then, out of nowhere, after a random amount of time (I could go a few whole days of not shutting the PC down or it happens in literally the second match), the PC starts to stutter. Not just the game itself, the whole PC starts to stutter; Roblox, the mouse cursor, even the audio garbles if the stuttering gets bad enough (By the way, my speakers are hooked up to the line-out in the back of the computer). When this happens, even the ethernet hardware seems to crap itself, so I get disconnected from the match!\n\nI updated the BIOS and installed a fresh install of Windows 11 going in, I updated the drivers, reinstalled Roblox incase anything funky was going on with it; I even cleared CMOS in case I turned on some setting my hardware didn’t like, but it also happened even on default settings… OCCT never detected up any errors when stress testing, either; if that were the case, I would’ve known by now.\n\nSince I went from AM4 to AM5, I had to also buy a new motherboard and RAM. I bought the mobo used (For the record, it was stated to be like-new), but I don’t want to spend another $100 to replace it if a new one won’t even fix the issue, so I called upon Reddit for help to figure out why this is happening to me.\n\nSpecs:\n\nMobo - ASRock B650M-C (upgraded from an ASRock B450M Pro4 R2.0)\n\nCPU - Ryzen 5 9600X (upgraded from a Ryzen 5 5500)\n\nRAM - Patriot Viper Extreme 5; DDR5, 2x16GB, 6000MT/s, CL30 \\[By the way, the highest I could get these modules in BIOS was 5600MT/s\\] (upgraded from Silicon Power Value Gaming; DDR4, 2x16GB, 3200MHz, CL16)\n\nGPU - XFX SWFT210 - RX 7800XT\n\nNVMe - LEVEN JPS600 2TB, Gen3x4\n\nCase (if it matters) - Cooler Master Q300L V2 Micro-ATX Tower; 1 back fan, 1 front fan (upgraded from a Zalman T6 ATX Mid Tower; 1 fan)",

Im asking from your experience have you seen a game hit those numbers that felt it needed it. Yeah you can hit them in a pixilated indie game but I’m fine with 144 for those games anyway, feels buttery smooth. But I never get close to hitting 144 in any AAA quality game with my rig and see online the games hardly reach those averages on the best cards out there.",

I figured out it was the ram and i turned off XMP, running at 2400mhz. All good.\nI swtiched the ram frequency to 2933mhz, upped the voltage a little and the Cyberpunk it’s still crashing but after 20-25 minutes compared to 10 minutes. \nI did an MemTest64 test and 5 errors appeared within 5 minutes, started taking out the ram modules one by one and the first one got an error in a minute ;) \nCurrently doing a test for other 2 modules in dual-channel, showing no errors in 10 minutes but i ll let it run for an hour maybe.\nAfter this, i will test the other module from the pair of the first ram to see if it has any errors also.\nGive me some advice please, what should i do next?\nSorry for the bad english, it’s my second language\n",

I don't do any heavy tasks but I do play on 4K TV and my 3070 has a hard time (Oblivion remastered could barely get 12 FPS) and I hate how DLSS looks like someone rubbed vaseline all over. I turn down settings as much as I can though. I don't care much about raytracing and stuff if the game looks good without it anyways. \n\nSo I was wondering, do you guys suggest waiting 2 more generations and hope the prices would come down for 5090 or grab a 3090?",

So I have been unplugging the 2 HDMI cords and 1 DP cord (I have 4 monitors in total) manually each and every time I need to power cycle my computer. But recently I've noticed that the ports on my graphics card have become a bit loose (to the point where my HDMI cord/port that goes to my tv will lose signal when touching or moving the cord at all near the back of my computer) and I've become concerned about the longevity of this approach in the long run.  \nAs for \"Fix the issue of your computer not booting when....\" I've tried everything other then replacing hardware (updates, drivers, os's(windows(fresh, old), Linux(Fresh)), bios's). I have a sneaking suspicions that the issues stems with my MOBO (Asus Prime z690M-Plus D4) as it has killed 4 sets of my corsair ddr4 3200 4x16 ram (praise lifetime warranty and RMA) and 2 Samsung 2tb 990 pro's (praise regular backups). I currently don't have the time to go through and replace piece by piece to root out the issue, nor the financial freedom to replace it all at once. So I am stuck with the \"deal with it\" phase of life.\n\nAny suggestions/help would be apricated.",

If I wait for a while, like in Warframe for example, I had to wait about 5 minutes with the CPU at 100% and 100 degrees, after that the computer goes back to normal usage, around 20 to 40% for most games I play.\n\nI want to know if this could be harmful to my computer and if there’s any way to fix it in case it is. It doesn’t happen with every game, and it only happens the first time I launch them. I think it might be compiling shaders or something like that, because after that it runs normally every time I open it again.",

She was the heart of it all.\n\nI treated her right — cleaned her carefully, gave her fresh pads and only the best thermal paste. She powered every block in Minecraft and, in her final year, gracefully became my entertainment center. Still glowing. Still faithful.\n\nLast night, her lights came on, but no display. Just silence — a quiet goodbye.\n\nGoodnight, my GTX 960.\nYou rendered my world one frame at a time — and though another GPU will take your slot, none will ever take your place.",

    "selftext": "Specs:\n\n* i7-13700K\n* ASUS STRIX Z790-F Gaming WiFi\n* RTX 4070 Ti ASUS TUF\n* 64GB DDR5 G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 6400MHz (2×32)\n* EVGA G3 850W\n* Lian Li O11 Dynamic\n\nThis is weird as hell.\n\nAfter removing my GPU to swap fans and re-route cables, my PC won’t start anymore unless I hit the CMOS reset button. Power button → nothing happens. Board RGB & standby LEDs are on → but zero fans, no post, like the board never sends PS\\_ON to the PSU.\n\nIf I clear CMOS → it instantly boots normally.  \nI can load into Windows, game, run Furmark, whatever — totally rock solid. NO crashes, temps fine.\n\nThen I shut down → try to turn on again → completely dead again. Needs CMOS clear every single time. 100% repeatable.\n\nThings I’ve tried:\n\n* reseated GPU\n* reseated RAM (also tried with one or the other stick in different slots)\n* reseated 24-pin + 8-pin CPU power\n* updated BIOS to latest version (after flash the system shut off → AND again needed CMOS clear to start)\n* CMOS battery reads \\~3.22V\n* no OC, XMP off, everything default\n* motherboard’s built-in START button behaves the same → so it’s not my case button wiring\n* I did add a Y-splitter to run an extra desk power button but that’s not the problem because the onboard button still doesn’t start it\n* this ALSO happened slightly even BEFORE touching anything — for a couple days I sometimes had to turn the PSU OFF for \\~10s and then back on to get a start\n* once it’s ON it’s perfectly stable for hours under load\n\nextra detail:  \nthe GPU gold pins were showing slightly (metal IO shield misalignment) — I bent the bracket back so now the card sits flush\n\nTo me this doesn’t feel like a PSU — PSU failures don’t act like “works fine under load but never triggers startup unless CMOS wiped.”\n\nFeels like some BIOS state corruption / NVRAM bug / power good logic issue on the motherboard side.\n\nWhat could cause this?  \nIs this a failing motherboard?  \nWould replacing the CMOS battery or reseating CPU make sense or am I going the wrong direction?",

Power button → nothing happens. Board RGB & standby LEDs are on → but zero fans, no post, like the board never sends PS\\_ON to the PSU.\n\nIf I clear CMOS → it instantly boots normally.  \nI can load into Windows, game, run Furmark, whatever — totally rock solid. NO crashes, temps fine.\n\nThen I shut down → try to turn on again → completely dead again. Needs CMOS clear every single time. 100% repeatable.\n\nThings I’ve tried:\n\n* reseated GPU\n* reseated RAM (also tried with one or the other stick in different slots)\n* reseated 24-pin + 8-pin CPU power\n* updated BIOS to latest version (after flash the system shut off → AND again needed CMOS clear to start)\n* CMOS battery reads \\~3.22V\n* no OC, XMP off, everything default\n* motherboard’s built-in START button behaves the same → so it’s not my case button wiring\n* I did add a Y-splitter to run an extra desk power button but that’s not the problem because the onboard button still doesn’t start it\n* this ALSO happened slightly even BEFORE touching anything — for a couple days I sometimes had to turn the PSU OFF for \\~10s and then back on to get a start\n* once it’s ON it’s perfectly stable for hours under load\n\nextra detail:  \nthe GPU gold pins were showing slightly (metal IO shield misalignment) — I bent the bracket back so now the card sits flush\n\nTo me this doesn’t feel like a PSU — PSU failures don’t act like “works fine under load but never triggers startup unless CMOS wiped.”\n\nFeels like some BIOS state corruption / NVRAM bug / power good logic issue on the motherboard side.\n\nWhat could cause this?  \nIs this a failing motherboard?  \nWould replacing the CMOS battery or reseating CPU make sense or am I going the wrong direction?",

We moved houses twice, changed cases three times. Every rebuild felt like renewing our vows. I replaced the motherboard and RAM over the years, but never her. I couldn’t. She was the heart of it all.\n\nI treated her right — cleaned her carefully, gave her fresh pads and only the best thermal paste. She powered every block in Minecraft and, in her final year, gracefully became my entertainment center. Still glowing. Still faithful.\n\nLast night, her lights came on, but no display. Just silence — a quiet goodbye.\n\nGoodnight, my GTX 960.\nYou rendered my world one frame at a time — and though another GPU will take your slot, none will ever take your place.",

The LG was too big, really, for my shallow desk, and having another LG OLED in the same room (the 65\" C3) meant that I was having issues with the remote control turning on both sets. 32\" is a better size for me: still very immersive, better PPI, and 240hz!",

    "selftext": "So after I posted my “dream PC” on pcmr, last week and some of you absolutely roasted it, I decided to tear it all down and move everything into a new case. My old NZXT H7 Flow has been solid for about 5 years, but I was just getting bored of it. Ended up grabbing the Hyte X50, and honestly, this might be the best case I’ve ever built in.\n\nIt looks sick (at least to me), cable management was stupid easy, and it somehow runs quieter than my old setup. Genuinely impressed.\n\nI’m still not loving how my AIO cables look though — if anyone has ideas on how to clean that up, please drop some advice. Not feeling it right now.\n\nAnyway, here’s the full setup:\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n* GIGABYTE X870 AORUS ELITE\n* MSI Suprim RTX 5080 Liquid SOC\n* G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB (AMD EXPO) 32GB\n* 2× WD\\_BLACK 2TB SN850X\n* CORSAIR Nautilus 360RS AIO\n* Hyte X50 case\n* Lian Li Edge 1000W PSU\n* 7× Lian Li Infinity Fans\n* 3× Lian Li LCD Wireless Reverse Fans\n* 3× GPU fans (mounted opposite the GPU AIO)\n\nRoast away or hit me with tips , I can take it ",

I'm happy with the final result.\n\nHad to do some drilling and tinkering to get the speaker stands to fit where I wanted. Redrilled plates, longer bolts, drilled riser, had to redo all my cable management. Not sure why I like doing it but I do.

My old NZXT H7 Flow has been solid for about 5 years, but I was just getting bored of it. Ended up grabbing the Hyte X50, and honestly, this might be the best case I’ve ever built in.\n\nIt looks sick (at least to me), cable management was stupid easy, and it somehow runs quieter than my old setup. Genuinely impressed.\n\nI’m still not loving how my AIO cables look though — if anyone has ideas on how to clean that up, please drop some advice. Not feeling it right now.\n\nAnyway, here’s the full setup:\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n* GIGABYTE X870 AORUS ELITE\n* MSI Suprim RTX 5080 Liquid SOC\n* G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB (AMD EXPO) 32GB\n* 2× WD\\_BLACK 2TB SN850X\n* CORSAIR Nautilus 360RS AIO\n* Hyte X50 case\n* Lian Li Edge 1000W PSU\n* 7× Lian Li Infinity Fans\n* 3× Lian Li LCD Wireless Reverse Fans\n* 3× GPU fans (mounted opposite the GPU AIO)\n\nRoast away or hit me with tips , I can take it ",

The performance jump from my 4080 laptop was a lot more than I expected - don’t need to listen to the fans whine anymore as well.\n\nI’ve adapted as much as I could to this unconventional built-in desk, and found a PC case that looks good for the available space/orientation, but a corner of the mousepad still needs to hang off the desk… When I find a replacement lamp to fix that color temperature difference to the right, this setup would probably be complete.\n\n(The DAC and AMPs are for my headphones that need to be kept separately in a display cabinet out of reach from my cats.)\n\nAlso, does this count as RGB Free?\n\nPC Parts:   \nAMD R9 9950X3D   \nTUF RTX 5090 OC   \nFURY Beast DDR5-6000 32GB **×** 2   \nFURY Renegade G5 4TB **×** 2   \nROG Strix X870E-E   \nNoctua NH-D15 G2   \nXPG VENTO PRO 120 PWM   \nPRIME TX-1600   \nFractal Design North Charcoal",

Hence the design for this one was born. \n\nThe shape is loosely a Microsoft Sculpt. The keys aside from my pinky are a stiffer spring, with browns for the pinkies. And even firmer ones for the mod keys, space bar etc. \n\nStarted out as a scrap 2x6, slowly took this shape. The switches are glued in, and the back is hand wired again. It turns out that scrap hdmi cables have great fine wire. \n\nThe keycap design was gonna be epoxy resin cast, then clay coated with something durable, then possibly coins. And finally landing on flattened, shaped and polished copper pipe. \n\nMy hope is the patina will start to show a typing pattern, as I use it. \n\n\nAnd if you’re doing math, covid was a while back. The design was completed in 2020, I just got back to it to finish this week. ",

It made for a fun (buggy at the time) FreeCAD project. \n\nIt was designed from fingerprints on paper to get the natural finger spacing of the keys, originally at the exact place. I later found that making it inclined columns at different distances from my wrist for each finger worked just as well.\n\nIt is using cherry MX brown (if I remember correctly apart a couple for Enter and backspace). \n\nThe chip was a “pinky”, “spiky” can’t remember it is quite some time back. \n\nI’ve used it a bit, tried to move to a fancy keymap for some time (Coleman DH if I remember)\n\nIt was OK but I could not move laterally the fingers as on a normal keyboard and had never done touch typing. I got bored and gave up. \n\nAnyway, it may inspire some people. I’ll try to upload a video on how the finger movements are quite natural even for the top left/right keys…\n\nThe multiple thumb rest keys were also usef",

    "title": "thoughts and reviews of some light tactile switches",
    "selftext": "hey yall!\n\nfirst time posting in literal years! i wanted to share thoughts about the slew of light tactile switches that have come onto the market this year. there have, of course, been light tactile switch offerings in the past, but i didn't buy those, so i won't be talking about them lol\n\nfor some context, i've always enjoyed mx browns and pretty much use that as the base for all light tactile switches to compare against. i also have been using pewter switches, gateron cap browns, mode signals, and ttc gold v2s (lol they're somehow bad but good to me idk) as some of the other light tactile switches i rotate through (for better or for worse). on top of that, i enjoy the 45g topre boards (hhkb2, fc660c, rf tkl, and cm novatouch (rip)). so even though these aren't all the light tactile switches i have experience in, for the sake of this post, they are my points of reference.  \n\n'light tactile' is also a hard to pin kind of description because it can mean certain things to different people. so for the purposes of this post, when i say light tactile, what i mean specifically is that a) the bottom out weight is typically in the 50-60g range AND b) the tactile bump is small, a 'p' or 'b' shaped bump depending on when and where the tactility starts. some people only refer to one or the other, so this is what i'm basing my thoughts on. \n\nthe switches i'll be writing about will have quick and dirty typing videos taken with an iphone 15 (and posted on imgur) so this is a big ass disclaimer that they haven't been recorded for any scientific consistencies or best audio/environment considerations or to even compare the switches to each other, specifically. they're just snapshots of how they sound inside the boards i've installed them in so ymmv. they may wildly differ in sound and feel to you on your boards. so just fyi, please and thanks.\n\nalso, i paid with all of these with my own money and am just a hobbyist returning to the community with thoughts on new switches that's making keebs fun again for me.\n\nhmx bleeds and bruises\n\n>these are basically twins with nary a difference between them save for .3mm of travel, at least according to milktooth's website. they are fun to type on. they're light and they sound bright and clacky. they're my first foray into using hmx switches (since up to this point they've only had linears) and i think that they are great intros to both hmx and/or to light tactile switches. they're lighter in weight than mx browns but they don't suffer for it. they are enjoyable to get into a long typing session (and fast too! the bruises i type in jumped to 160wpm for the 30sec typing test without even meaning to!). i pretty much immediately put them onto boards as soon as i got them and they have yet to disappoint. i co-sign a lot of the reviews these have gotten and i think deserve a bit of their hype. i enjoy how gentle the tactile bump is because i typically like to feel just enough friction when i'm typing but without how typo-prone i get with linears, even after i've gotten used to the board. overall, solid sets of switches and i recommend them for their feel, sound, and price point. at time of writing, on milktooth's site, they're both $0.42/each, so $4.20 for 10pcs. i find this price reasonable. the naming and color scheme are also quite clever so i would def give them points for that.\n\n>[hmx bleeds typing sounds on neo ergo](https://imgur.com/XGOIh6z) (aluminum case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\n>[hmx bruises typing sounds on mode 2022 sonnet](https://imgur.com/XyaAFlJ) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, top mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nhmx k01 \n\n>these and the akko bittersweets are the closest to mx browns by feel out of all the switches on this lineup and for that i quite enjoy them. they're a good pick for those who want a 'better' and 'more refined' version of an mx brown (no mods required, smooth, no scratchiness, etc -- even tho tbf, cherry has upped their game in their mx2a or hyperglides). i like the characteristics of mx browns but for those who might not want the effort involved in 'improving' on them, k01s are nice out of the box. the sound is clackier than mx browns to me, unsurprising of hmx's signature sound profile. at time of writing, on milktooth's website, they go for $0.35/each which is a pretty good value overall, definitely cheaper than bleeds and bruises or mx browns ($0.40/each on milktooth, but you may have better luck elsewhere. omnitype for example has them for $0.35/each but they come in packages of 35pcs instead of 10pcs). \n\n>[hmx k01 typing sounds on mode tempo](https://imgur.com/6rEOJY0) (aluminum case, copper plate, copper weight, gasket mount, no foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nakko bittersweets\n\n>i was most fascinated with these because of a few things. they are a departure in sound from hmx, promising a subtler and thockier sound profile. according to akko's website, not only are they the tactile counterpart to akko rosewoods (thocky linears), they also describe its name based on the sound and feel that someone might feel about them: \"[This bump is light that it might sometimes go unnoticed, producing a “bittersweet” mixed impression./The sound and feel might be “bitter” for some, yet “sweet” for others.](https://en.akkogear.com/product/bittersweet-switch-lubed/)\" which i thought was pretty neat as i'm sure there are people who would feel that way about them. they are comfortable and they are flatter in sound in the polygon-7 but in a pleasant way. overall, i'm getting good mileage out of them and would find them an easy rec for their value. i know there are akko cilantros that many people enjoy because of its stronger tactility and lighter weight, but i think bittersweets are more for me because of the smaller bump -- but disclaimer, i do not have akko cilantros and have never felt them. but based on reading comments, they feel like they're a gentler version of the cilantros. at time of writing, they're $15 for 45pcs or $0.33/each on amazon, which is what i paid. the akko website has 90pcs for $28 or $0.31/each. \n\n>[akko bittersweet typing sounds on daringrun polygon-7](https://imgur.com/2FVf4fh) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, gasket mount, plate foam, mda profile pbt keycaps)\n\ngateron mini i and gateron weightlessness\n\n>got these from the ikasaya closeout sale and i'd heard decent things about them so i thought i'd give them a try. the differences at least on the ikasaya website lists weightlessness as having a \"light to medium bump\" whereas mini i has a \"gentle tactile bump.\" i think if bleeds/bruises are twin sisters, then these are siblings close in age. the difference between them is that the weightlessness's tactile bump is a smidgen more pronounced and bounces back a bit more noticeably, for me, than the mini i. but that's when i'm taking the time to press down on them. for regular typing, the differences are negligible. overall, their typing experiences are quite pleasant and fall in line nicely with the rest of the switches i've mentioned here. at time of writing, from the ikasaya closeout sale, i got the gateron mini i for $37.50 for 90 switches, so about $0.42/each. in other places, they go for $0.60/each or $6 for 10pcs at milktooth and $10.80 for 18pcs at kineticlabs. as for the weightlessness, they were $40.10 for 90 switches, so about $0.45/each. on amazon, they go for $23.99 for 35pcs, so $0.69/each which is not as budget friendly as the other options here, though it does show a 10% coupon upon purchase. milktooth right now has a sale on them for $5.50 for 10pcs so $0.55/each. lumekeebs also offers the same $0.55/each. respectable price point at the discount, but i don't know if they're worth it above that.\n\n>[gateron mini i typing sounds on monsgeek mg75w](https://imgur.com/96YsEx6) (plastic case and plate, tray mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)  \n[gateron weightlessness typing sounds on keychron v1 max](https://imgur.com/AqW3JB2) (plastic case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, osa profile pbt keycaps)\n\n[typing sounds playlist link](https://imgur.com/a/light-tactile-switches-typing-sounds-N1VjrJg) (imgur album)\n\nif i were to order them in light tactility in the context of mx browns as my center, then it goes as follows: hmx bleeds/bruises, akko bittersweets, mx browns, hmx k01, gateron mini i, gateron weightlessness. \n\nin sum, i'm quite satisfied with this cohort of light tactiles. these switches are great out of the box, need no modification, and are great switches for those who want to try them out as well as for those who already enjoy light tactiles. i feel good recommending them, but of course, your experiences and preferences are your own and up to your own curation and determination. i'm a happy typist with these switches and glad that the rest of my light tactile collection have good company. i look forward to rotating them with each other and on different boards than how they're configured at the moment but for now, i'm enjoying how each one feels on the boards i've chosen for them. \n\nfeel free to talk about your experiences or suggestions of other light tactiles you enjoy as well as ask questions or chat about these. thanks a bunch for reading! \n\n",

    "selftext": "Finally got my Imprint after 2 months of wait. Started my split journey with a Moonlander, moved on to a Glove80, tried the Silakka54 and Corne in between before getting the Imprint. Was using the Glove80 up until I received the Imprint. While I found the Glove80 to be a great keyboard, there were just a few missing features that I wanted, like hot-swappable switches, MX switches, and the integrated trackballs.\n\nInstalled Durock Ice King switches and clear polycarbonate keycaps. Replaced the default black trackballs with Perixx PeriPro-303 purple and green trackballs. I was eyeing the sport balls trackballs from Perixx but they are very expensive.\n\nOrdered the Nylon + Aluminium material, with 5-rows and 5 full bottom row keys. Got the wider palm rest with Bamboo inserts. While the Imprint was made with XDA compatibility in mind, I found that they do fit the tallest Cherry profile keycaps. I am thinking of trying Full metal or ceramic keycaps in the future if they offer all 1u keys.\n\nSome other photos showing the build process. The last photo shows the weight mod I have done, adding an extra 200g of weight to each palm rest, bringing the weight of each palm rest to 270g. I have also did a tape mod and added Poron foam inside the case.",

    "selftext": "I bought a K6 non-pro about a week and a half ago to replace a Logitech membrane keyboards I was getting tired of. While I originally thought to keep it stock I thought I'd make it pop a little. I'm still using the stock keycaps ..and I tossed the gateron blues in it for browns pro v3, though I do have some milky yellow and green apples waiting for something.\n\nWhen I got the board my only intention was to just add the foam to the case, clip the stem feet on the stabs and do a tape mod. Oddly enough the feet on the stabs were already cut despite this being bought new so it saved me on that as it was decently lubed with no rattle or ticking on any stabilizer.\n\nI ended up painting the aluminum pieces. I used chalk paint ..and while it came out okay, it didn't adhere as well as I wanted to as corners had a harder time even after lightly sanding the bare pieces to grab the paint and finish but either way ..good enough cause I don't have a sprayer to have done it differently to get a more consistent finish. I stayed with the stock keycaps as I feel they contrast well with the muted green (pic doesn't do the color justice it's a little more muted like a matcha green color). Unfortunately, I'm skin allergic to pbt so I'm limited to ABS options ..I'm not particularly fond of the polycarbonate keycap sound.\n\nAt the time I was working on this I came across the weikav lucky65 v2 which in waiting to arrive soon. I ended up getting a barebones version along with a set of gmk double shot ABS nightshade clones. So this K6 might end up being shortlived on my desk and live more with my portable devices. I originally wanted to go with gazzew U4T with the lucky65, but unfortunately thanks to tariffs I'd rather wait it out and will instead be pairing it with either the milky yellow or the green apple switches.",

    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn’t even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn’t expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "selftext": "So, I built my first keyboard during COVID- I wanted to hand wire it, and I ended up dremel- carving the keycaps. \n\nIt’s been my daily typer since… but I immediately wanted a better one. Hence the design for this one was born. \n\nThe shape is loosely a Microsoft Sculpt. The keys aside from my pinky are a stiffer spring, with browns for the pinkies. And even firmer ones for the mod keys, space bar etc. \n\nStarted out as a scrap 2x6, slowly took this shape. The switches are glued in, and the back is hand wired again. It turns out that scrap hdmi cables have great fine wire. \n\nThe keycap design was gonna be epoxy resin cast, then clay coated with something durable, then possibly coins. And finally landing on flattened, shaped and polished copper pipe. \n\nMy hope is the patina will start to show a typing pattern, as I use it. \n\n\nAnd if you’re doing math, covid was a while back. The design was completed in 2020, I just got back to it to finish this week. ",

    "title": "thoughts and reviews of some light tactile switches",
    "selftext": "hey yall!\n\nfirst time posting in literal years! i wanted to share thoughts about the slew of light tactile switches that have come onto the market this year. there have, of course, been light tactile switch offerings in the past, but i didn't buy those, so i won't be talking about them lol\n\nfor some context, i've always enjoyed mx browns and pretty much use that as the base for all light tactile switches to compare against. i also have been using pewter switches, gateron cap browns, mode signals, and ttc gold v2s (lol they're somehow bad but good to me idk) as some of the other light tactile switches i rotate through (for better or for worse). on top of that, i enjoy the 45g topre boards (hhkb2, fc660c, rf tkl, and cm novatouch (rip)). so even though these aren't all the light tactile switches i have experience in, for the sake of this post, they are my points of reference.  \n\n'light tactile' is also a hard to pin kind of description because it can mean certain things to different people. so for the purposes of this post, when i say light tactile, what i mean specifically is that a) the bottom out weight is typically in the 50-60g range AND b) the tactile bump is small, a 'p' or 'b' shaped bump depending on when and where the tactility starts. some people only refer to one or the other, so this is what i'm basing my thoughts on. \n\nthe switches i'll be writing about will have quick and dirty typing videos taken with an iphone 15 (and posted on imgur) so this is a big ass disclaimer that they haven't been recorded for any scientific consistencies or best audio/environment considerations or to even compare the switches to each other, specifically. they're just snapshots of how they sound inside the boards i've installed them in so ymmv. they may wildly differ in sound and feel to you on your boards. so just fyi, please and thanks.\n\nalso, i paid with all of these with my own money and am just a hobbyist returning to the community with thoughts on new switches that's making keebs fun again for me.\n\nhmx bleeds and bruises\n\n>these are basically twins with nary a difference between them save for .3mm of travel, at least according to milktooth's website. they are fun to type on. they're light and they sound bright and clacky. they're my first foray into using hmx switches (since up to this point they've only had linears) and i think that they are great intros to both hmx and/or to light tactile switches. they're lighter in weight than mx browns but they don't suffer for it. they are enjoyable to get into a long typing session (and fast too! the bruises i type in jumped to 160wpm for the 30sec typing test without even meaning to!). i pretty much immediately put them onto boards as soon as i got them and they have yet to disappoint. i co-sign a lot of the reviews these have gotten and i think deserve a bit of their hype. i enjoy how gentle the tactile bump is because i typically like to feel just enough friction when i'm typing but without how typo-prone i get with linears, even after i've gotten used to the board. overall, solid sets of switches and i recommend them for their feel, sound, and price point. at time of writing, on milktooth's site, they're both $0.42/each, so $4.20 for 10pcs. i find this price reasonable. the naming and color scheme are also quite clever so i would def give them points for that.\n\n>[hmx bleeds typing sounds on neo ergo](https://imgur.com/XGOIh6z) (aluminum case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\n>[hmx bruises typing sounds on mode 2022 sonnet](https://imgur.com/XyaAFlJ) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, top mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nhmx k01 \n\n>these and the akko bittersweets are the closest to mx browns by feel out of all the switches on this lineup and for that i quite enjoy them. they're a good pick for those who want a 'better' and 'more refined' version of an mx brown (no mods required, smooth, no scratchiness, etc -- even tho tbf, cherry has upped their game in their mx2a or hyperglides). i like the characteristics of mx browns but for those who might not want the effort involved in 'improving' on them, k01s are nice out of the box. the sound is clackier than mx browns to me, unsurprising of hmx's signature sound profile. at time of writing, on milktooth's website, they go for $0.35/each which is a pretty good value overall, definitely cheaper than bleeds and bruises or mx browns ($0.40/each on milktooth, but you may have better luck elsewhere. omnitype for example has them for $0.35/each but they come in packages of 35pcs instead of 10pcs). \n\n>[hmx k01 typing sounds on mode tempo](https://imgur.com/6rEOJY0) (aluminum case, copper plate, copper weight, gasket mount, no foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nakko bittersweets\n\n>i was most fascinated with these because of a few things. they are a departure in sound from hmx, promising a subtler and thockier sound profile. according to akko's website, not only are they the tactile counterpart to akko rosewoods (thocky linears), they also describe its name based on the sound and feel that someone might feel about them: \"[This bump is light that it might sometimes go unnoticed, producing a “bittersweet” mixed impression./The sound and feel might be “bitter” for some, yet “sweet” for others.](https://en.akkogear.com/product/bittersweet-switch-lubed/)\" which i thought was pretty neat as i'm sure there are people who would feel that way about them. they are comfortable and they are flatter in sound in the polygon-7 but in a pleasant way. overall, i'm getting good mileage out of them and would find them an easy rec for their value. i know there are akko cilantros that many people enjoy because of its stronger tactility and lighter weight, but i think bittersweets are more for me because of the smaller bump -- but disclaimer, i do not have akko cilantros and have never felt them. but based on reading comments, they feel like they're a gentler version of the cilantros. at time of writing, they're $15 for 45pcs or $0.33/each on amazon, which is what i paid. the akko website has 90pcs for $28 or $0.31/each. \n\n>[akko bittersweet typing sounds on daringrun polygon-7](https://imgur.com/2FVf4fh) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, gasket mount, plate foam, mda profile pbt keycaps)\n\ngateron mini i and gateron weightlessness\n\n>got these from the ikasaya closeout sale and i'd heard decent things about them so i thought i'd give them a try. the differences at least on the ikasaya website lists weightlessness as having a \"light to medium bump\" whereas mini i has a \"gentle tactile bump.\" i think if bleeds/bruises are twin sisters, then these are siblings close in age. the difference between them is that the weightlessness's tactile bump is a smidgen more pronounced and bounces back a bit more noticeably, for me, than the mini i. but that's when i'm taking the time to press down on them. for regular typing, the differences are negligible. overall, their typing experiences are quite pleasant and fall in line nicely with the rest of the switches i've mentioned here. at time of writing, from the ikasaya closeout sale, i got the gateron mini i for $37.50 for 90 switches, so about $0.42/each. in other places, they go for $0.60/each or $6 for 10pcs at milktooth and $10.80 for 18pcs at kineticlabs. as for the weightlessness, they were $40.10 for 90 switches, so about $0.45/each. on amazon, they go for $23.99 for 35pcs, so $0.69/each which is not as budget friendly as the other options here, though it does show a 10% coupon upon purchase. milktooth right now has a sale on them for $5.50 for 10pcs so $0.55/each. lumekeebs also offers the same $0.55/each. respectable price point at the discount, but i don't know if they're worth it above that.\n\n>[gateron mini i typing sounds on monsgeek mg75w](https://imgur.com/96YsEx6) (plastic case and plate, tray mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)  \n[gateron weightlessness typing sounds on keychron v1 max](https://imgur.com/AqW3JB2) (plastic case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, osa profile pbt keycaps)\n\n[typing sounds playlist link](https://imgur.com/a/light-tactile-switches-typing-sounds-N1VjrJg) (imgur album)\n\nif i were to order them in light tactility in the context of mx browns as my center, then it goes as follows: hmx bleeds/bruises, akko bittersweets, mx browns, hmx k01, gateron mini i, gateron weightlessness. \n\nin sum, i'm quite satisfied with this cohort of light tactiles. these switches are great out of the box, need no modification, and are great switches for those who want to try them out as well as for those who already enjoy light tactiles. i feel good recommending them, but of course, your experiences and preferences are your own and up to your own curation and determination. i'm a happy typist with these switches and glad that the rest of my light tactile collection have good company. i look forward to rotating them with each other and on different boards than how they're configured at the moment but for now, i'm enjoying how each one feels on the boards i've chosen for them. \n\nfeel free to talk about your experiences or suggestions of other light tactiles you enjoy as well as ask questions or chat about these. thanks a bunch for reading! \n\n",

And even firmer ones for the mod keys, space bar etc. \n\nStarted out as a scrap 2x6, slowly took this shape. The switches are glued in, and the back is hand wired again. It turns out that scrap hdmi cables have great fine wire. \n\nThe keycap design was gonna be epoxy resin cast, then clay coated with something durable, then possibly coins. And finally landing on flattened, shaped and polished copper pipe. \n\nMy hope is the patina will start to show a typing pattern, as I use it. \n\n\nAnd if you’re doing math, covid was a while back.

So I’m looking for that sweet spot scaling factor from experienced users, that would give me optimal estate without having to strain my eyes sand producing minimal scaling blur. Or just your general preference. I’d have experimented myself but Windows requires signing out and back in for custom scaling changes. ",

I've read that DLSS (which I'm not opposed to using) can help with the issue of 4K not being divisible by 1440p, upscaling something something.

But is it really not good with FSR? I I mainly play League, Valorant and some AAA Games like Indiana Jones or Expedition 33\n* MO27Q28G (Tandem WOLED, 1440p, 27\"): In non-gaming scenarios, I found the gray banding quite severe, and text clarity still wasn't great.\n\nSo far, I haven't found the perfect fit. I think the MO32U2 was my favorite overall. OLED just looks amazing, but since I also use my monitor for office work, text clarity has been the main issue holding me back.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or recommendations?

I did some comparisons to see how much the TV settings affected:\n● HGiG off, TM static = 1310 nits\n● HGiG on,  TM static = 1100 nits\n● HGiG off, TM active = 2200 nits\n● HGiG on,  TM active = 1100 nits\n\n1) I thought it might be due to the test window being 2/10% larger than the screen (so it might be correct to look at another value of RTINGS), but the Windows window seems to be around 10% of the screen.However, if the size does matter, then why is it that in the third step, when the screen is fully lit, the maximum visible nits are still 1100 with HGiG? Shouldn't they be less?\n\n2) Why can't I get around 2000 nits with HGiG enabled?",

    "title": "Long term usage of the AOC Q27G40XMN?",
    "selftext": "Howdy everyone,\n\nI just purchased 2 AOC Q27G40XMN monitors and I was wondering if anyone has used these extensively and can provide some insight as to their long term usage. The reviews on this monitor were kind of all over the place so I genuinely don't know what to expect. For my price range (under $500 for 2 27\" monitors) I feel like these are a great buy, even with some of their drawbacks.\n\nI was considering the AOC Q27G3XMN, which people seem to really like, but then came across a really good deal for this newer model which purportedly handles motion better and has a lot more dimming zones. Many of the people that didn't like the monitor mentioned \"black smearing\". I'm not really sure what \"black smearing\" is but I'm coming from a VA panel, so hopefully it's something I'm already used to and wont even notice. I know about the \"lottery\" in terms of firmware version and some people being plagued by the  \"desaturation bug\".\n\n>via Rtings:\n\n>There's also a bug when using the 'Strong' Local Dimming setting in the 'DisplayHDR' HDR Mode. Content looks overbrightened and desaturated, and it stays like this even when switching back to SDR or turning the monitor on and off again. The only way to stop the issue is by resetting the monitor. We don't recommend using the 'Strong' Local Dimming setting with the 'DisplayHDR' HDR Mode, and it's better to use 'Medium' instead because it doesn't have this bug. That said, this issue doesn't happen in any of the other HDR Modes.\n\nHopefully we are far enough out from the original manufacturing error that this is no longer an issue, but I will just use the \"medium\" settings if not.\n\nI am coming from a curved LC27F591FDNXZA which I bought all the way back in 2017, so I'm sure anything will feel like a massive upgrade for me. I just hope I'm happy with them as I don't like returning things and have a tendency to keep monitors for a LONG time. Needless to say, display tech has come a long way since I last looked into buying a monitor. I considered OLED, miniLED, VA/IPS, high refresh rate, and even ultrawide. I had a laundry list of other monitors I was considering but the finalists came down to:\n\nAOC Q27G40XMN\n\nAOC Q27G3XMN\n\nASUS XG27ACS\n\nPG27QFT1B\n\nI selected these based of a combination of reviews on RTINGS, this subreddit, and Monitors Unboxed. Additionally, price and availability were two major factors as well. I ended up going with the Q27G40XMN in part to find out if miniLED is as good as everyone says it is and also because I feel like for what I paid ($200 each) I couldn't pass it up. I understand it's a VA panel and everyone likes to shit on VA panels, but I'm coming from a VA panel, so I'm hoping it doesn't bother me.\n\nThe only real thing my Q27G40XMNs don't have that I really wanted is integrated speakers. Yes, I know they suck, but I just wanted them. It's a clutter thing not a sound quality thing. In fact one of the only reasons I was considering the PG27QFT1B was because it has integrated speakers and it was dirt cheap with seemingly good reviews.\n\nIf for some reason I'm unhappy with the these I will most likely return them and go the \"safe\" route and buy 2 ASUS XG27ACS for around the same price unless someone has a better suggestion.\n\nI'm hoping someone here has spent some real time with these monitors and can provide some insight, good OR bad. Additionally if anyone has any calibration, color correction, or settings they would like to share I would be super grateful.\n\nThanks!\n\nP.S: If I've made a huge mistake and should have bought something else please let me know ASAP! There's still time to cancel, lol!",

I have no interest in 4K, just want a decent 1440P IPS display with widescreen capability.\n\nI mean there is technically nothing wrong with my current monitor but with IPS now having higher refresh rates and HDR I think it's time for an upgrade even if I'm not doing 4K (plus TN's viewing angle problem)\n\nI'm currently looking at the ASUS ROG Strix 27” QHD display (XG27ACS) which is at a great price on Amazon $219.00\n\nASUS TUF Gaming 27” 1440P Monitor (VG27AQM5A) $229.00\n\nOther options (So I dont seem biased towards ASUS)\n\nLG UltraGear QHD 27-Inch Gaming Monitor 27GL83A-B $265.00\n\nacer Nitro 27 KG271U $179.99\n\nAOC Gaming Q27G41ZE 27 inch $169.99\n\nAlienware 27 Gaming Monitor - AW2725DM $189.99\n\nWill say the Alienware is surprisingly tempting considering it has 2 USB ports and has Gsync compatibility.",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\n(Regarding rule 4 of the subreddit, I'm hoping there is an actual economical fix to this, might be a very simple thing, just curious)\n\nI’ve got two identical AOC 1080p 144Hz monitors connected to my RTX 3070. One of them has been problematic for years, and the issue seems to be getting worse over time.\n\nThe problem started with 144Hz not showing the bottom ~20 lines of pixels. I switched it to 120Hz, which was fine at the time. Recently, however, 120Hz started cutting off ~50 lines at the bottom, and 144Hz now barely shows the top 100 lines — the rest of the screen is missing. To get a full image, I now have to drop it to 100Hz, which is really frustrating.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tested:\n- Swapped DisplayPort and HDMI cables → exact same behavior  \n- Tried different ports on both the GPU and monitor → no difference  \n- Both monitors use the same setup, but the other one works perfectly at 144Hz  \n- So the issue is clearly internal to the monitor itself, not the cables, ports, or PC  \n\nIt seems like some internal scaling or panel timing problem is gradually getting worse over time. I have a video showing the issue if needed.  \n\nHas anyone seen this kind of behavior in AOC monitors? Any ideas for a fix, firmware update, or workaround before I consider replacing it?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\nSpecifics:\n- Monitor: G2 SERIES AOC 27G2U 27 GAMING MONITOR (2x)\n- GPU: Nvidia Geforce RTX3070-8GB (most probably not at fault)",

The problem is, I can clearly see screen tearing while playing, and it’s driving me insane.\n\n\n\nAfter a ton of research, I finally found the monitor I thought was perfect for me — the Dell Alienware AW2725DF. But right before pulling the trigger, I came across another option that threw me off: the BenQ Zowie XL2546X+. It claims to completely eliminate screen tearing thanks to DyAc 2 and all that esports tech.\n\n\n\nSo now I’m stuck.\n\nAs someone who only plays PUBG and considers myself a decent player, which one should I go for?\n\n\n\nIf we do a Zowie vs Alienware comparison specifically for PUBG, which one comes out on top?\n\nCan’t the Alienware handle tearing just as well as the Zowie, or is Zowie really that much better for competitive play?\n\n\n\nWould really appreciate any insights from people who’ve used either of these, especially PUBG players.",

Single cable USB-C 60+ watt for Mac laptop\n6. No movies or creative design work.\n\nI currently have an Apple Studio Display 5k 60hz. I absolutely love it for the high DPI, decent speakers, decent webcam, and sleek design. Looks professional on my desk without the gamer aesthetic and minimal cable clutter.\n\nMy PC has a Thunderbolt passthrough so I can game on it with my Ryzen 9800X3D + Radeon 9070XT desktop.\n\nDownside is I can't connect my consoles via HDMI and the high resolution and low refresh are not ideal for games. In BF6 my current game I'm getting 50-100 FPS on low in very demanding maps so I'm force to turn on FRS4 and use upscaling tricks to make the game playable. This is not ideal and I think I'd do better with a less demanding resolution. I'm also interested in the smoothness of higher refresh rate screens.\n\nI'd like to connect 1-2 game consoles at a time. I'd like the monitor to be robust and I'm worried about burn in and the screen getting scratched, I really like the glass on the Apple monitor. I've had problems in the past with wife/kids touching/knocking things into matte LCD screens and scratching the screen. This has happened twice!\n\nI was eyeing the Asus XG27ACDNG ROG Strix 26.5. Would you go with this or is there a better option? I'd like to keep this around $700-800 USD but I can do higher if someone has a perfect recommendation. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Seeking a slightly curbed, or not the aggressive 1800R screen. I currently have 2 27\" monitors at a slight angled from each other and it's time to move to one solution. I believe the 34\" is the smaller of the side of this ledger as I also don't want to spend $1K on a monitor. \n\nWhere have folks found good reviews of such options? Again, it seems most vendors (e.g. Samsung, ASUS, etc) are heavily dominated to the gaming market and I need to cut through that and find a clear, concise monitor for hours of reading each day.\n\nI believe the LG34WQ73A-B may meet a lot of my criteria, at least on paper (i.e. non-aggressive curve of 3800R, inexpensive, height adjustable, should be good with text). Trouble is, I can't find very many non AI-created YouTube commercial reviews of this monitor. \n\nI may just have to settle a safe Samsung S34C502GAN, which is basically a 34\" flat monitor since I really don't want big curve for working from home. A little would be nice since my two 27\" monitors are slightly angled in for better reading. \n\nAgain, curious if any current LG users are running this 34WQ73A-B or something similar with a slight curve and nothing aggressive.

    "selftext": "We’ve started a **partnership with Titan Army** and will be showcasing new models going forward (with honest community feedback) and probably some giveaways in the future. First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters. [P2712V Link](https://bit.ly/4gmDFse)\n\n**P275MV Plus (Mini-LED with DyDs)**\n\n* Same **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** dual mode\n* **Mini-LED FALD (1152 zones), HDR1000**\n* **What is DyDs**: the backlight is driven in sync with the panel update to keep motion clean **with local dimming on** and to improve visibility in dark scenes (less smearing/black crush than typical FALD IPS). [P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

I've already tested the following models:\n\n* KTC M27P6 (1152-zone Mini LED, 4K, 27\"): The blooming is way too noticeable, especially when moving the mouse.\n* MO27Q2 (QD-OLED, 1440p, 27\"): Text clarity at 1440p on QD-OLED just isn't good enough for my taste.\n* MO32U2 (QD-OLED, 4K, 32\"): Text issues were pretty much gone here, but I was concerned that 4K might be overkill for me since I have a 9070XT and would often need to upscale. But is it really not good with FSR? I I mainly play League, Valorant and some AAA Games like Indiana Jones or Expedition 33\n* MO27Q28G (Tandem WOLED, 1440p, 27\"): In non-gaming scenarios, I found the gray banding quite severe, and text clarity still wasn't great.\n\nSo far, I haven't found the perfect fit. I think the MO32U2 was my favorite overall. OLED just looks amazing, but since I also use my monitor for office work, text clarity has been the main issue holding me back.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or recommendations? I'd really appreciate your help!",

    "selftext": "I'm trying to understand more about the intricate world of HDR, and since I didn't find any answers online I have a couple of questions.\nI've decided to switch to PC gaming, so I recently bought a good PC and a new tv. The tv is a Samsung QN90D, which according to RTINGS reaches 2100 nits in a 10% window, so I expected the HDR calibration tests to reach around that value, but in both the Windows 11 and PS5 tests the symbol disappears at around 1100 nits. it's a notable discrepancy.\nI should point out that HGiG (Samsung calls it Game HDR) is enabled and tone mapping is set to static. I did some comparisons to see how much the TV settings affected:\n● HGiG off, TM static = 1310 nits\n● HGiG on,  TM static = 1100 nits\n● HGiG off, TM active = 2200 nits\n● HGiG on,  TM active = 1100 nits\n\n1) I thought it might be due to the test window being 2/10% larger than the screen (so it might be correct to look at another value of RTINGS), but the Windows window seems to be around 10% of the screen.However, if the size does matter, then why is it that in the third step, when the screen is fully lit, the maximum visible nits are still 1100 with HGiG? Shouldn't they be less?\n\n2) Why can't I get around 2000 nits with HGiG enabled?",

    "title": "Long term usage of the AOC Q27G40XMN?",
    "selftext": "Howdy everyone,\n\nI just purchased 2 AOC Q27G40XMN monitors and I was wondering if anyone has used these extensively and can provide some insight as to their long term usage. The reviews on this monitor were kind of all over the place so I genuinely don't know what to expect. For my price range (under $500 for 2 27\" monitors) I feel like these are a great buy, even with some of their drawbacks.\n\nI was considering the AOC Q27G3XMN, which people seem to really like, but then came across a really good deal for this newer model which purportedly handles motion better and has a lot more dimming zones. Many of the people that didn't like the monitor mentioned \"black smearing\". I'm not really sure what \"black smearing\" is but I'm coming from a VA panel, so hopefully it's something I'm already used to and wont even notice. I know about the \"lottery\" in terms of firmware version and some people being plagued by the  \"desaturation bug\".\n\n>via Rtings:\n\n>There's also a bug when using the 'Strong' Local Dimming setting in the 'DisplayHDR' HDR Mode. Content looks overbrightened and desaturated, and it stays like this even when switching back to SDR or turning the monitor on and off again. The only way to stop the issue is by resetting the monitor. We don't recommend using the 'Strong' Local Dimming setting with the 'DisplayHDR' HDR Mode, and it's better to use 'Medium' instead because it doesn't have this bug. That said, this issue doesn't happen in any of the other HDR Modes.\n\nHopefully we are far enough out from the original manufacturing error that this is no longer an issue, but I will just use the \"medium\" settings if not.\n\nI am coming from a curved LC27F591FDNXZA which I bought all the way back in 2017, so I'm sure anything will feel like a massive upgrade for me. I just hope I'm happy with them as I don't like returning things and have a tendency to keep monitors for a LONG time. Needless to say, display tech has come a long way since I last looked into buying a monitor. I considered OLED, miniLED, VA/IPS, high refresh rate, and even ultrawide. I had a laundry list of other monitors I was considering but the finalists came down to:\n\nAOC Q27G40XMN\n\nAOC Q27G3XMN\n\nASUS XG27ACS\n\nPG27QFT1B\n\nI selected these based of a combination of reviews on RTINGS, this subreddit, and Monitors Unboxed. Additionally, price and availability were two major factors as well. I ended up going with the Q27G40XMN in part to find out if miniLED is as good as everyone says it is and also because I feel like for what I paid ($200 each) I couldn't pass it up. I understand it's a VA panel and everyone likes to shit on VA panels, but I'm coming from a VA panel, so I'm hoping it doesn't bother me.\n\nThe only real thing my Q27G40XMNs don't have that I really wanted is integrated speakers. Yes, I know they suck, but I just wanted them. It's a clutter thing not a sound quality thing. In fact one of the only reasons I was considering the PG27QFT1B was because it has integrated speakers and it was dirt cheap with seemingly good reviews.\n\nIf for some reason I'm unhappy with the these I will most likely return them and go the \"safe\" route and buy 2 ASUS XG27ACS for around the same price unless someone has a better suggestion.\n\nI'm hoping someone here has spent some real time with these monitors and can provide some insight, good OR bad. Additionally if anyone has any calibration, color correction, or settings they would like to share I would be super grateful.\n\nThanks!\n\nP.S: If I've made a huge mistake and should have bought something else please let me know ASAP! There's still time to cancel, lol!",

And is it worth trading a bit of refresh rate for the added Quantum Dot?\n\n\n(When I realized how much I paid for that 1080p monitor years ago compared to what you can get for the same price now… it’s CRAZY.)",

I've already tested the following models:\n\n* KTC M27P6 (1152-zone Mini LED, 4K, 27\"): The blooming is way too noticeable, especially when moving the mouse.\n* MO27Q2 (QD-OLED, 1440p, 27\"): Text clarity at 1440p on QD-OLED just isn't good enough for my taste.\n* MO32U2 (QD-OLED, 4K, 32\"): Text issues were pretty much gone here, but I was concerned that 4K might be overkill for me since I have a 9070XT and would often need to upscale. But is it really not good with FSR? I I mainly play League, Valorant and some AAA Games like Indiana Jones or Expedition 33\n* MO27Q28G (Tandem WOLED, 1440p, 27\"): In non-gaming scenarios, I found the gray banding quite severe, and text clarity still wasn't great.\n\nSo far, I haven't found the perfect fit. I think the MO32U2 was my favorite overall. OLED just looks amazing, but since I also use my monitor for office work, text clarity has been the main issue holding me back.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or recommendations? I'd really appreciate your help!",

    "selftext": "I'm trying to understand more about the intricate world of HDR, and since I didn't find any answers online I have a couple of questions.\nI've decided to switch to PC gaming, so I recently bought a good PC and a new tv. The tv is a Samsung QN90D, which according to RTINGS reaches 2100 nits in a 10% window, so I expected the HDR calibration tests to reach around that value, but in both the Windows 11 and PS5 tests the symbol disappears at around 1100 nits. it's a notable discrepancy.\nI should point out that HGiG (Samsung calls it Game HDR) is enabled and tone mapping is set to static. I did some comparisons to see how much the TV settings affected:\n● HGiG off, TM static = 1310 nits\n● HGiG on,  TM static = 1100 nits\n● HGiG off, TM active = 2200 nits\n● HGiG on,  TM active = 1100 nits\n\n1) I thought it might be due to the test window being 2/10% larger than the screen (so it might be correct to look at another value of RTINGS), but the Windows window seems to be around 10% of the screen.However, if the size does matter, then why is it that in the third step, when the screen is fully lit, the maximum visible nits are still 1100 with HGiG? Shouldn't they be less?\n\n2) Why can't I get around 2000 nits with HGiG enabled?",

At my moms house tho it is so difficult to play games because the tv's graphics suck and it is just difficult to focus on stuff with the tv. The monitor i want to buy is the Asus Tuf VG32VQM5B, i only need about 50 bucks to buy it but my mom said it was a horrible idea because i was gonna sit to close to it? She was expecting me to sit as far away from it as my tv. She said she'll think about it but that pretty much means no. Please help\n",

    "selftext": "I recently purchased the Dell P2725DE monitor online without having a look at it in real life. Having used only upto 24 inch FHD monitors till now, my first reaction on hooking it up was that the text and buttons looked too small. If I set the scaling to 125% (Windows OS), I lose a significant amount of screen real estate. So I’m looking for that sweet spot scaling factor from experienced users, that would give me optimal estate without having to strain my eyes sand producing minimal scaling blur. Or just your general preference. I’d have experimented myself but Windows requires signing out and back in for custom scaling changes. ",

I might, if the French fries are that good, eat the whole thing without dip once or twice. But generally, even if it covers up some of the French fry flavor, I still want a dip like ketchup. Basically, being a little bass heavy or treble heavy gives music a little spice, and it’s definitely better for every day use if you find it to sound better to you.

I bought these myself as it seemed like a pretty good deal at around $200 with discount codes.\n\nThe Ananda Stealth has a slightly warm tonality. It’s very non-fatiguing and quite balanced. Details are apparent and clearly heard in the background, it doesn’t try to push it up right in your face. Soundstage is okay, not super wide but imaging is good.\n\nFor $200, I think the Ananda Stealths are one of the best valued open headphones. I don’t think I heard anything that sounds as all rounded for $200. I think they’re great for someone who prioritizes sound quality. In terms of build and comfort, it’s just okay, afterall that’s not Hifiman’s strength.",

In the case of the first song, I believe the culprit is the Expanded Edition of the album, but I just can't find the original one in CD quality (digital) for offline use. Both FLAC versions are mixed too loudly (and don't feel as dynamic, though this might be placebo) and have artifacts that aren't (as) present on YouTube, otherwise YouTube is just as crisp and detailed, absolutely nothing is missing, it's just that it's a higher quality master and not that FLAC is more revealing... \n\nI would immensely appreciate help because the 1st song is arguably the most spectacular one I've ever heard on my HD 600, and the 2nd one has really great vocals and layering.\n\nOn a side note, about different file formats and masters:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltjio4AM2uw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltjio4AM2uw)\n\nI thought this sounded great, but the FLAC version actually has noticeably more treble and bass which sound really, really great, not boosted and distorted at all. This is not because of FLAC because if you take that FLAC file, drop it in Audacity and export as a 128 kbps MP3, it's all still there unlike on YouTube, so some masters are really just different and it's not a matter of 128 kbps MP3 being audibly worse than up to 24-bit 192 kHz FLAC, really.

    "selftext": "I know this has been beat to death multiple times with multiple sticks, but I was scrapin' the web and didn't end up satisfied - was looking for some more opinions. \n\nI have owned my HD600's for awhile now - a few years probably, and they were one of my first non-completely-crap headphones after using some ear splitty Sony's and BD's. I originally got them for mixing, as I was not really into audiophile listening with headphones (had decent speakers), but they I got bit by the bug. I have a few pairs I really like now, but I have always been curious about the other HD alternatives.\n\nIn my search for that beautiful midrange timber with some more heft in the bass, I got the HD660S2's not long after they were released. They were also really smooth, with great timbre, but even more \"veiled\" and after a year or two, I decided they were not for me, and moved them on. I kept the HD600's, but mostly as a reference, because the bass roll off displeases me. I would never reach for them over, for example, the Edition XS. Totally different sound signature, each with advantages and disadvantages, but overall, that's where that fell out for me.\n\nOn a lark, I just saw the 650's for $300 on Amazon, which is a pretty low price (might still be there if you are reading this soon after it posts - I literally just clicked on them) so I snagged them. I figure I will probably not like them better than the 600 and will send them back, but the curiosity is killing me. A lot of people say they are just a more warmer or even muffled 600, and some say they are an improvement.  I guess I will find out, but I am really curious to hear some fresh opinions from users of both. Which do you prefer and why? Are they both just out of date, with all the great sub $500 offerings out there these days? Not to mention the >$500 offerings.\n\nIn return for your opinions, I will share mine once I get these on my head for a week or so, and get a good solid impression. I am expecting to be underwhelmed. I kinda wonder if I need a tube amp to properly appreciate the HD6XO line. I really like my current dac/amp (dx9), but I could add a modestly priced tube amp to the arsenal.",

    "title": "Flux FA-10: Brutal Power, \"Nervous\" Character",
    "selftext": "​I was looking for a powerful and clean-sounding Solid State (SS) amplifier for my HE6se V2 headphones when I stumbled upon this Flux FA-10 on sale for €350 shipped. So, I pulled the trigger. Now I'm here with this Class A \"beast,\" capable of delivering a staggering 16W into 32 ohms (10.5W into 64 ohms).\n​Overall, the sound was... adequate. But let me unpack this a little bit further.\n\n\n**​An Aggressive Presentation**\n\n​I don't want to complain about the cleanliness and detail this unit brings to the table on some (though not all) of my headphones, but I genuinely dislike its aggressive and 'in your face' presentation. \nIt sounds tense, like a nervous person trying to tell a fairy tale to a child. Granted, I'm coming from tube amps like my Eufonika OTL, or the relaxed sound of the Mojo 2, but... I wasn't expecting this kind of house sound from Flux.\nI usually associate Class A with a slightly warm character and a rolled-off treble, which this device is definitively not.\n\n\n**​Lack of Dynamics on Elex and HE6**\n\n​The HE6 and the Elex are among the most punchy and dynamic headphones on the market. The Elex can sound punchy even if connected to a [potato](https://www.instructables.com/Potato-Battery-Understanding-Chemical-and-Electric/), and the HE6 demands significant power to fully express its dynamic nature.\nNevertheless, with the FA-10, both headphones sound unimpressive dynamically, especially the Elex, which really surprised me.\nI usually plug them into an Aliexpress dongle or the Chord Mojo 2 and am always satisfied with the bass impact.\n​The Elex's punchiness seems irrecoverable even with EQ, which only introduces mud into the sound. The HE6, however, can regain some of its impact through equalization.\n\n\n***​Note***: It is important not to confuse the role of EQ. It can add bass quantity, but the violence of the attack of a bass note is what dictates its physical impact. This is a physical characteristic that does not solely relate to the Frequency Response (FR). For example, the FiiO FT1 has much more bass than the Elex, but it sounds way less punchy.\n\n​The Elex sounds somewhat muddy and poorly controlled compared to the Mojo 2, while the HE6 sounds largely as its graph suggests.\n\n\n**Decent ​Synergy with the HD660S2**\n\n​The Sennheiser HD660S2 has a very relaxed sound signature (with some sparkle around 6-8kHz). They actually sound good with this amp because it balances their chill presentation, occasionally making them sound aggressive too.\n\n\n**​Strengths Worth Highlighting**\n\n​Despite my criticisms, I want to highlight the amp's strengths:\n- ​Incredible Power: It runs my HE6se V2 on low gain, using only 3/4 of the volume knob.\n- ​Pristine Cleanliness and Detail: The sound is dead clean and highly detailed.\n- ​Stage and Separation: The stage is a decent, medium size, and the imaging and instrumental separation are top-notch for the price.\n- Flexible Inputs: It accepts balanced inputs, but since it's a pure single-ended device, both the SE and balanced outputs should sound virtually the same. This is a great feature, making the FA-10 more flexible regarding the source you feed it.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n​Ultimately, I would never recommend this amp to people sensitive to the 3-4kHz region like myself. This amplifier is a cannon for those frequencies (from a presentation standpoint). If you have a warm and relaxed headphone, it can truly wake it up. But for neutral to bright headphones, especially aggressive ones like the HE6 and Elex... proceed at your own risk!\n",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m running into a bit of a challenge getting enough power for my main headphones from my Focusrite Scarlett 4th Gen 2i2. The interface itself is great for tracking and monitor control, but the headphone out just doesn’t have the juice I need for the Dan Clark AEON closed X which I love. Need it to record and track etc. \n\nI’ve tried a couple of external DAC/amp setups (one distorted badly from the Scarlett’s line outs, the other colored the sound more than I liked), and I’m now trying to figure out the *right* way to integrate an external amp or DAC/amp combo without messing up my monitor chain. \n\nMy Scarlett’s main outputs are already feeding my studio monitors, so I’m not sure of the best wiring approach. I tried Y splitters so I can keep the monitors as well as TRS to RCA on the zH3 by Fosi, it distorted. On the Schiit Magni it didn’t until higher levels but it did not sound good at all so I returned it. \n\nBasically I’m trying to answer:\n\n* What’s the cleanest way to add a dedicated headphone amp (or DAC/amp) to a Scarlett interface when the main outs are already used for monitors? Should I just upgrade to Topping E2x2 Audio Interface?\n\n* Are there any level-matching or wiring tricks to avoid distortion when feeding an external amp from an interface?\n\n* Would it make more sense to just switch to something like a Topping L50 as just amp (would it make a difference in the wiring) or FiiO k7 (has a DAC though.) I wanted to use the DAC just for pleasure casual listening outside my DAW. \n\nI’d prefer to keep using the Scarlett if possible (and definitely not use ASIO4ALL), but I’m open to what most people do for this type of setup.\n\nAppreciate any advice.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I don't talk on here very often but I had been searching for headphones after my last pair which lasted me about 13 years (Sennheiser HD598's) and still worked fine.\n\nI settled on the Aune AR5000's because they fit my pricepoint. I got them, EQ'd them and fell in love with that nice creamy bass.\n\nThat was exactly 14 months ago. For my usage I babied them, was always gentle despite the feeling of sturdy construction, and adored them. Never dropped.\n\nI have a small'ish to medium head. When I would use my pc I would simply pick them up and put them on like any other headphone.\n\nToday I wake up and the absolute weirdest thing happen, I went to put them on but they weren't... feeling right, I checked and YEP, they had cracked from soft usage after a year. I had seen other users with the pin for the ear support coming out because it was plastic but thought it would never happen to me because I'm so gentle with them.\n\nI have emailed my retailer and aune to see what they say but I'm pretty sure I'm SOL.\n\nMy advice? DO NOT BUY. This isn't a quality control problem, its a design and fundamental flaw in having that section made from plastic.\n\nI'm livid and now have to go searching for new headphones AGAIN.\n\n\n\nEDIT: If aune refuse to help I will investigate the replacement bands, or just outright upgrade to a pair of Meze 105's\n\nThese headphones were great for gaming and music and I feel the 105's have a better looking construction.\n\nAlso after plugging my over decade old HD598's they sound almost as good as the Aune AR5000's. So I think my over-enthusiasm for their sound might have been for reasons I can't explain. These are 90% the headphone sound of them and considering the age of them, that's hilarious.",

    "title": "Audeze LCD5 with EQ is .... WOW (what took me so long)",
    "selftext": "So Ive had a couple of superb  headphones, of which my favorites have been the U12T Iem, Utopia 2022, KSE1200, yet none touch the speaker setup, but thats more to do with physicality.  Anyways, I always loved the technicality of the LCD5 for mixing but hated its tonality for music enjoyment, as its not enjoyable relative to the Utopia, or even the U12t.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xict0bc0iyf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd00e3b32336bb99067869b285106ebc701b94c9\n\nAnyways having recently gotten the U12Ts I was very impressed, as they are pretty damn technical, yet also enjoyable for music enjoyment, and dont require EQ or anything.   I used to EQ the KSE1200 for example which I still think performs technically better than anything else I have, but its a pain....  So that comparison is what got me curious about WHAT IF I spend some time to EQ the LCD5 with a phase linear plugin.\n\nANYWAYS, this is what this post is about:\n\nThe U12T got me curious about adding EQ to the LCD5, and then I saw other people often complain about the LCD5 until they EQ it.  I used the Utopia 2022, as a reference for a tuning I enjoy.  I found in mac the app soundSource allows me to use some of the same software I use for mixing and mastering, to EQ these things.   After EQing it, it punches like the Utopia, but the resolution is still that of the most detailed headphone I have ever heard. Im gonna get hate for this, but even the Stax SR009 doesnt do bass like the LCD5 (or at least I imagine as I dont have them side by side, but I remember it doesnt do bass like the Utopia in terms of weight). With EQ the LCD5 is just WOW.   Now the downside however is this is a pain in the ass to have to setup.\n\nThe setup:\n\n•⁠  ⁠I  found a software in the MAC called soundsource that allows applying corrective curves and also some of the same plugins used for mastering.\n\n•⁠  ⁠On the above software Audeze LCD-5 was setup to Oratory reference.  This corrects some imbalances but also sounds a bit dull next to the Utopia when set to the same curve for example.\n\n•⁠  ⁠To correct that, I then follow this by adding a hi pass WAY below the hearing range at 16hz to help the driver work better not dealing with stuff I cannot hear anyways.   Then I re-add some of the frequencies in the 2.6k nd 5.1k (only about 2-3db), which are frequencies dulled by the oratory curve, in this headphone. This brings a bit of that character I like in vocals in the Utopia, but smooth like the LCD5's are good at.\n\nThe LCD5 can take HUGE gain vai EQ without distorting. Its honestly really impressive.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02k9l6yk0iyf1.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=92b89d90635e2e02a6427c642433eeac833cb9b7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8f6te6yk0iyf1.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=009b587ecf81fffbbfaf2f95aa2aa5bdae0c7732",

    "title": "A New Study on the Equivalence of Harman OE Target on Modern Test Fixtures, Co-authored by Sean Olive and Dan Clark Audio",
    "selftext": "> Summarized by Qwen.\n\nFor years, the *Harman target*—a frequency response profile derived from extensive double-blind listening tests—has served as a benchmark for “neutral” or preferred headphone sound. Originally defined using a specific GRAS 45CA test fixture equipped with a custom “Welti” pinna and an RA045 (Type 3.3) ear simulator, this target has become widely referenced in both research and product development.\n\nHowever, a critical issue has emerged: many modern labs and manufacturers now use newer test fixtures—such as the **GRAS 45CA-10** (with KB5000 anthropomorphic pinna and RA0402 ear simulator) and the **Brüel & Kjær Type 5128** (featuring a Type 4.3 ear simulator compliant with ITU-T P.57). These fixtures differ acoustically from the original Harman setup, particularly in their **acoustic transfer impedance**, especially below 500 Hz and above 3 kHz. Applying the original Harman target directly to measurements from these newer systems can lead to misinterpretation—and potentially misguided tuning decisions.\n\nIn a new paper presented at the **AES 159th Convention** (October 2025), **Sean Olive** (the architect of the Harman target) and **Dan Clark** address this problem head-on. Their work defines *Harman-equivalent targets* specifically calibrated for the GRAS 45CA-10 and B&K 5128 fixtures, ensuring that headphones tuned to these revised targets will sound subjectively similar to those tuned to the original Harman reference.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe authors measured seven diverse headphones including open-back and closed-back models from Dan Clark Audio, HiFiMan, and Sennheiser—on all three fixtures (original Welti, GRAS 45CA-10, and B&K 5128). Using a straightforward calibration method in Room EQ Wizard (REW), they derived fixture-specific targets by:\n\n1. Measuring each headphone on both the original and new fixtures.\n2. Computing the ratio between responses (e.g., KB5000 / Welti).\n3. Applying this ratio to the original Harman target (phase-conjugated and smoothed) to generate a new, equivalent target.\n\nThis process accounts for the unique acoustic loading and leakage characteristics of each fixture.\n\n## Listening Tests Confirm Validity\n\nTo validate the approach, the team conducted controlled **MUSHRA-style listening tests** with 13 experienced listeners, comparing seven versions of the target:\n\n- The original Harman target (Reference)\n- Fixture-specific targets calibrated per headphone\n- Targets averaged across 7 or 20 headphones\n\nResults were clear: when headphones were equalized to their **fixture-specific, individually calibrated targets**, they sounded **nearly identical** to the original Harman reference. In statistical terms, the **B&K 5128** and **GRAS 45CA-10** targets (calibrated per model) were **not significantly different** from the reference in perceived similarity.\n\nBy contrast, targets derived from **averages across multiple headphones** (e.g., “5128_20”) scored lower—though still within the “very similar” range—highlighting that **individual calibration yields the best match**.\n\nInterestingly, the type of headphone (open vs. closed-back) had minimal impact on results, suggesting the method is robust across designs.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nFor engineers and audiophiles alike, this work resolves a long-standing ambiguity: **you cannot directly apply the classic Harman target to measurements taken on modern fixtures** and expect accurate tuning. Instead, fixture-specific equivalents are needed.\n\nEncouragingly, the differences between targets are often correctable with **simple bass and treble shelving filters**, as most deviations occur in well-defined frequency regions. This opens the door for more consistent, cross-platform headphone evaluation—and more reliable interpretations of published measurements.\n\nWhile the study focused on seven models, the calibration framework is generalizable. Future work may yield standardized correction targets for common fixtures, enabling broader adoption without per-headphone measurement.\n\n## Reference\n\nOlive, S., & Clark, D.

    "title": "Arya Organic…Wow",
    "selftext": "My thoughts on the Arya Organics (I know there’s plenty of reviews etc, but what harm can another do)\n\nI jumped into this hobby about 2 years ago roughly. Through that time, I’ve been through plenty headphones, but the only ones I spent a LOT of time with was 2. The Arya Stealth, and the HD560s. \n\n(Skip further down if you don’t care about the previous stories)\n\nThe Stealths were mind blowing to me, I did have planars before these. The edition xs (felt way too cheap for the 300 mark at the time. The Ananda Nanos (clamped like a vice). So picked up the Arya Stealths for £710, which was their cheapest price at the time. I owned these for 6 months. Every time I put them on, I was astounded at the sound. However, after 2 months, I rarely used them, I didn’t have the time to listen, and didn’t want £700 lying around. So I reluctantly sold them, and decided to pick up the cheaper pair, the HD560s. So I could still enjoy music, without feeling guilty having some premium set collecting dust. And these were fine, for £90, they were great.\n\nRecently however I’m now in a position where I have a lot more free time, and for that reason, I wanted to pick up a higher end headphone again. I was debating between many, but in the end it kept boiling down to the Stealths, which were now £460. But then saw the Organics were just £120 extra as “open-box” from Hifiman. One thing I absolutely hated with the Stealths was how harsh some of the treble was, and at the time I didn’t have EQ. So I was stuck with harsh treble in a few songs I enjoyed other times. Between owning the 560s and Stealths, I did pick up the JDS Element 4 Dac/Amp in preparation for higher end cans in the future, and to play around with EQ. So hearing the Organics had a harsh treble, it didn’t really deter me as I had the capabilities to town it down.\n\nSo now onto the Organics…\n\nLOOKS:\nThese things are absolutely gorgeous! It’s like taking your grandads beautifully varnished wooden table and chairs, and adding a modern touch to it. It makes them stand out and look far more premium than the price suggests (I’m aware they were 1500 odd on release, but on current pricing, the point stands). They feel more premium for this matter. I the one massive negative, is you have to wear them to listen, meaning I can’t just stare at them when in use. \n\nCOMFORT:\nAnyone who’s familiar with the Arya lineup, know that this line of headphones are on the comfier side of the Hifiman brand. They clamp just enough to not feel loose, but not too hard that it feels like the hulk is crushing your skull (Nanos). Yes the pads aren’t the most comfy pads on any headphone, they’re actually the one aspect I don’t like. They don’t feel premium, and the fabric design sometimes catches the odd strand of hair which isn’t pleasant. However changing these means altering the sound, which you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT, want to do. The headband is perfect though. Suspended straps are my favourite on headphones, adds a premium feel, look and feels like far less pressure on your head. Not to mention how wide they are, it helps distribute the weight so well.\n\nUNBOXING: \nDead, £5 unboxing experience, but realistically who cares…\n\nSOUND:\nGrand. Exciting. Smooth. \n\nThe 3 words I’d use to describe the sound. Which goes to show how versatile they are. They give off such a ‘grand’ feeling, when you listen to orchestral pieces, it feels like you’re in a theatre listening to a band playing, but like you’re middle row. Not first row where it feels in your face, and not back row that it feels like it’s far away. It’s that perfect middle ground where it’s around you, but so that you can hear everything so cleanly. They’re exciting in the sense that after an orchestral piece, you put on an EDM track, pop or anything in that region, and it feels like you want to get up and just dance, but don’t, as these probably would fall off your head. And then you go for a very vocal focused piece of music, and the smoothness of the voice just glides through your ears. There’s no moment where it’s aggressive (unless it needs to be) or where it holds back. It’s like an electric supercar. You put your foot down, and it picks up straight away, but with no aggression, just picks up and gets going right away. \n\nOnto the specifics:\n\nBASS - Very solid. Definitely stronger than the Arya Stealths. When I had them, the bass was there, but it needed a tad more punch. These add that very subtle punch, where you know it’s bass, but it doesn’t slip into the other frequencies and overthrow them. It’s controlled VERY well. The sub bass is fantastic too. My favourite song to test this is “The Droid Invasion and the Appearance of Darth Maul” from The Phantom Menace. The drums at the start provide that sub bass test and it really shows how it handles it well. Doesn’t get fatiguing, just presents it so smoothly. Not to mention how clear the drums sound, like you can visualise the fabric drum stick hitting against the massive drum. The bass is also quick when needing to be. In many pop songs where there is the common use of bass, or in rap music, it’ll show the bass, and stop it perfectly. It never feels like it over presents itself. They also hold the bass off so well from overpowering the mids. Many headphones either make the bass so minimal that you don’t realise there should be bass, and many push it so hard it dims down the vocals. These control it so so well.\n\nMIDS - I would say the weakest out of the Low, Mid and High ends. Definitely NOT bad, it’s really really great. However when there is consistent bass present, and a lot of higher end or many many instruments playing, the vocals definitely take a seat back. They’re still very clear, but it pushes the instruments forward a bit more. Which isn’t bad at all, and some people may prefer this. It’s more of a preference thing. I certainly don’t mind it, and it’s not something I’m gonna be quickly to go and EQ, but if I was, it’s the first thing I’d play with, just to bring them forward a touch. BUT, when there’s only a low end and vocals, or high end and vocals, they are stunning. They just sound so real and ‘organic’, it’s like having a conversation with David Attenborough, just so nicely spoken and a voice you wish could commentate on your whole life. \n\nHIGHS - Lies were told here, or obviously it’s just down to personal hearing. But these are NOT ‘peaky’ or ‘harsh’. The high end is so well controlled. With the Arya Stealth, I absolutely could not listen to Nightcall - Kavinsky from Drive. The chorus of the song was so harsh I literally couldn’t listen to it. So the first song I wanted to try was that, and on these I could listen to the entire song with no issues. They have just enough brightness to make everything sound clean and clear, but not too much that it comes across as piercing during songs. Same with Time - Pink Floyd. The start with all the clocks can be very piercing with poorly controlled highs, but it’s like the headphones actively know it’s going to sound harsh and presents them just a tone down so that you don’t have to turn the volume down or skip forward. It was my one worry with these, and although EQ is an option, I did want to enjoy them stock for as long as possible. Which I’m ecstatic with the fact I can.\n\nSOUNDSTAGE - Wide, but not artificially wide, just naturally wide. Like I said with the orchestral hall and being “grand”. It just sounds so perfectly deep. It’s not like the sound is coming from across the room, but it’s not like the song is being played right next to you. It’s similar to car speakers, in the way it’s all round you, but not as if you’re listening to the persons car next to you. It’s intimate enough that you feel like it’s YOUR music, not someone else’s near you, but also distant enough that it’s like it’s your own personal concert. \n\nSEPARATION - Always tough because if a song is produced badly, even the greatest ever headphones won’t be able to separate the parts. But in a well produced track, you can actively hear each and every instrument and voice. In “Call it what you want” by Taylor Swift, there’s many instances where there are backing vocals playing over Taylor, and you can hear each one clearly, but as if they’re actually behind her. Like Taylor’s singing into your ear, whilst the backing singer is sat 2 foot behind her also singing, but you can clearly tell one is the main, one is the backing. The 560s definitely struggled with this, you often couldn’t hear the multiple voices, so now listening to many songs, I’m hearing voices I didn’t realise were there (I actually checked on 2 occasions that I wasn’t listening to a remix).\n\nConclusion:\nYes. Just yes. Stellar\n\nSetup I’m using:\nHifiman Arya Organic -> JDS Element 4 -> MacBook M3 -> Audirvana (because Tidal is buggy as anything on Mac since iOS 26 and Apple Music doesn’t auto change the Sample Rate) \n",

The music is gritty, dirty, and honestly very fun to listen to. \n\nTruthfully the reason why I mention any of this is because I want to keep my things nice and prevent any wear, in other words, I want to protect my investment the best I can but I'm unsure if music like this (or any music) can really be considered \"unsafe\".\n\nI'll add, I am not listening at high volumes during this album, nor do I have anything EQ'd weirdly, it is essentially just a tube amp, a 6SN7 tube, and the headphones.\n\nIf anybody would want to hear what I'm talking\nabout, some songs I was questioning are all by Jane Remover:\n\nDreamflasher, movies for guys, Experimental Skin, search party.\n\nOnce again, I'm aware these songs are supposed to sound gritty, but there are also some more clear and crisp sections in each of these, so I'm trying to decide if I should embrace the grit and imperfections of these songs through the LCD 2c if it's safe, or continue on my Beyers.",

It's fine on a few people but a lot of us won't get as much or as good bass as we should. The Audeze headband really help in this area. It's still quite v-shape headphones but really enjoyable for K/J-pop or ani-song.",

This is erratic and random sometimes it doesn't! This tinnitus type noise goes away after a few seconds! And comes back when music is paused and it's a repeat cycle!(And no this isn't ANC noise coz it happens when even ANC IS OFF and only happens on the left ear driver/ hardware). And for this price i except a premium consistent experience, NOT this!\n\nAnd secondly, also only the left side earpad makes a mild squeaky toy noise when pressed, but right earpad is dead SILENT even when it's pressed. Is this is how it is suppose to be? Also ironically when earpads were interchanged, SURPRISE surprise! STILL only left side earpads makes this mild squeaky noise when pressed and whilst trying to wear it! (Despite the same earpad when on the right driver is dead SILENT and left earpads is silent on right?!)\n\nAnd thirdly!, the return policy is NON-EXISTENT! In my country!  And when asked about it throught their painfully call with executive they said RESET IT which I had already done MULTIPLE TIMES and tried MULTIPLE DEVICES from latest Android, IPAD AND MacBook Pro. Still it's persistent (random and occasional mild white noise/ mechanical noise from left ear driver alone)\n\nThey gave me an ultimatum to even get it checked I HAVE TO Ship my brand new expensive headphone AT MY OWN EXPENSE AND OWN RISK To their warehouse ACROSS THE COUNTRY! And after sonova took over all the service center were closed except one with courier-in type service center!\n\nMany told that the white noise/ TINNITUS issue SPECIFICALLY Left driver one is kinda common. Can you guys as confirm this for me and also other FUTURE BUYERS. Can you check and test in SILENT room with pausing after playing music.\n\nLastly, is this the QUALITY CONTROL by a 'TRUSTED' german brand? And hassle is almost unbearable and everytime I PAUSE I get left ear driver making a very mild tinnitus sound randomly! \n\nu/sennheiserconsumer\n",

    "selftext": "I had a go at processing the HUTUBS data, which are in ear measurements of the HRTFs and HD 800 S for 96 subjects, and the HD 650 for 64 subjects.\n\nMy intent was to compare the accuracy of the gras and bk5128 rigs to real heads. Each measurement is compensated to the diffuse field curve of the respective head with a -1 dB slope. By compensating to that target we are in effect \"subtracting\" the effect of each individuals ear geometry and are left with only the perceived variation in frequency response between heads caused by the acoustic impedance of the headphone.\n\nHD 800 S:\n\nBoth measurement rigs rise up to 4kHz too quickly and also show the first peak occurring closer to 6k, while real heads show it occuring around 5k. Using a tone generator I can hear it peaking at 5.2khz on my head. The second peak occurs around 7k in HUTUBS. On my head I can hear it around 7.2kHz. Both rigs show it closer to 8 kHz.\n\nUsing this as a basis for EQ results in a much more pleasing sound than the harman target profiles which don't deal with these peaks adequality.\n\nHD 650:\n\nThe HD 650 shows a lot more variance, despite that, there are features in the response that aren't present on either GRAS or BK rig. The first being a peak at 5kHz. Using a tone generator I can hear this very clearly on my head. Then there is a strong recession between 6k and 8k Hz which the gras rig doesn't show clearly.\n\nUsing this as a basis to EQ results in these two headphones sounding the most similar I've ever heard two different models of headphone sound (albeit still different).\n\nI've included headphones.coms processing of the same data for 30 heads, and the results seem similar.\n\nMy take away from this is despite the variance of the results between heads there is a clear average or trend in terms of the most common locations for peaks and dips, and neither of the most common industry standard rigs match it.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe HUTUBS, GRAS and BK5128 measurements all use different units. HD 800 S unit variation is incredibly good so hopefully this isn't an issue. I sourced the GRAS measurements from crinacle and the BK5128 measurements from earphones archive, and overlayed them on top of crinacles measurement.",

Phenomenal. \n\nHaving said that, I hope you got the reference to what I will be comparing the Avantone to.\n\nQuick mention - I do drive my Headphones with the Fiio K11 R2R since a couple weeks, which already improved the sound of the AKG by a mile compared to the onboard solution.\n\n\\- Avantone Planar 2 Impression starts here -\n\nOut of the box first impressions were not too overwhelming, they are fairly unimpressive at first glance from a visual standpoint, the boxy \"cheese grater\" design looks actually kinda nice in the polished black colour I got here tho.  \nBuild quality is very solid, compared to all my previous headphones which were all just big chunks of plastic you get a solid metal frame, fairly thick leather strap which also has the width to spread the enormous weight of the headphones across your head so they actually do NOT feel heavy at all.  \nThe AKG already had comfortable Velour Pads but damn, those Pads on the Avantone are silky smooth and nice to touch.\n\nNow to the sound,\n\nOut-of-the-box: Not to impressive if you ask me. I felt like something was \"missing\" compared to the AKG. Everything felt kinda flat and very narrow in comparison.  \nBy no means did they sound bad, but just.. boring?  \nHaving said that, the low-end did have more punch and they also provided more details in busy passages. It was just uninspired and so narrow, as if you were stuck in a small box.  \nAt that point I was contemplating if the price tag of 429€ was worth it or if I should return them.   \n  \nBut then I gave em another shot after researching a bit and applied an EQ (Self Tweaked Version of the u/Oratory1990 EQ for the first iteration of the Avantone Planar) via APO (Peace Interface) and I was simply shocked.  \nIt really opened up the stage and completely removed the feeling of being boxed in. They take the EQ as if they were made for it.   \n  \nThe low end got even more punch without any signs of being too much for the driver. The midrange is just as detailed as before but the elevated treble is what enhances the whole experience to new heights. As I described earlier everything sounds alive, the stage is wider and most importantly - It's fun! (Which I feel like is a point a lot of people forget to talk about)  \n\n\nBy no means do I have the equipment to measure those things or the extensive knowledge to compare it to hundred other headphones in different price brackets.   \nI cant tell you, especially after applying the EQ, if they follow some imaginary \"perfect\" frequency response curve.  \nAll I can say is - I love those things after applying the EQ and will keep them for a long time to come! \n\nThat is all from me, if there is anything you would like me to add feel free to ask in the comments as this is my first \"review\" I probably missed a ton of important stuff.\n\nCheers y'all!",

    "title": "PSA: Aune's Official Store charges import fees to US customers, no mention of this anywhere on their website",
    "selftext": "I ordered the AC45 from Aune's Official Store (mall.auneaudio.com) as I wasn't sure how long it would be before they're more widely available in the US and whether they would be carried by any of their distributors since they're a fairly niche product category. Shipping to the US was free which is nice but at no point was there any mention that they wouldn't handle import fees (tariffs) on their end before the product was shipped and I didn't think anything of it since I've had multiple orders from China where the seller handled everything ahead of time which is the proper way to do it. Today I got an email from UPS that I need to pay for the import fees on a shipment and I knew right away what it was for, ended up paying $27 of which $15 went to UPS for their BS charges to handle the import paperwork and processing. I'm a little annoyed at Aune since not only do they not mention this on their website or at checkout but they also picked the worst possible shipping option since DHL, FedEx, and UPS are known to be POS companies that charge extra fees on top of the actual import fee for essentially doing nothing. If they had shipped it via the postal service it wouldn't have been as big of an issue since they won't charge that extra fee and I would've only had to pay $12 in stead of $27. So if you're in the US and are thinking about ordering from Aune directly be prepared to pay extra on top of what the item costs, it's worth getting their products through other sellers if you can even if the price is slightly higher than their own store is selling them for to avoid these extra charges and the added hassle.\n\nP.S. I know that Aune isn't entirely to blame since this wouldn't be an issue at all if it wasn't for the current joke of an administration pretending to run this country but it's also the current reality that we're forced to live with and other companies have handled it much better than Aune has. If they had taken the time to figure out what the best option was instead of basically ignoring it and making their customers deal with the aftermath this wouldn't be an issue.",

    "selftext": "So you decide to upgrade your audio setup with a nice pair of headphones. BuT WhAt PaIr Of HeAdPhOnEs? You ask. Well here it is a guide to headphone tuning.\n\nSo first off there needs to be a disclaimer being no matter what headphones you buy, they will not sound perfect to you. Sonic \"perfection\" is entirely unique to you with complex ideas like HRTF and more importantly how that noggin of yours processes sounds. To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

    "selftext": "Hello, I haven’t really seen much coverage of this product online, and I thought it deserves some more attention so I will try to share my thoughts.\n\nThis headphone is not available in many countries, but I was able to buy it from Aliexpress for around £20($26) including postage. A retro-style lightweight Bluetooth openback headphones from Philips to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\n\nIn this product category, the closest competitor I could think of is Koss porta pro, Kph30i or the wireless koss porta pro all of which cost more than this product. I’ve also compared it to some grados and my HD6XX and HD560s.\n\nGiven the price range, I was shocked at the tonal balance and the resolution. I would say Grado and Koss both have a very distinct texture of sound that makes it sound really cheap with little bass. In my ears, Ringo definitely has a more balanced V shape sound signature and has less of that cheap texture to the sound. Given my experience and preference, I would take this over Grado SR60/80i/e or Koss porta pro/kph30 any day for its timbre and tuning even if it was the same price point.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the resolution or timbre isn’t gonna beat an HD6XX, and the build is quite cheap. But I find the build with its metal headband more sturdy than any of the Koss headphones that can even be triple the price. For a fun sounding Bluetooth headphones with 26 hour battery, lightweight and decent retro design AND built in app eq for around £20 is crazy. \n\nI’ve got too many headphones and have bought all the headphones mentioned in this review, but I will be keeping these around which is the biggest compliment I can give as I have given away/sold the all the Koss products. I’m no expert and have no intention to try over selling these but for anyone who’s considering a sub 100 open back Bluetooth headphones, these are the best in my experience!",

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. \n\nAfter many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to expand the rapidly growing collection and snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they’d be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. \n\nAfter about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. All the things the 600 family can’t do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. I would even say that I feel let down by the vocal presentation of the HD490 Pro's either, so I think it may just be some rose tinted glasses effect as I haven't owned my 6XX in nearly 4 years. Anyway, I started by just listening to the suede pads for the first 3-4 hours, and have now been listening to the other set. Both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. \n\nThe suede pads are definitely warmer and more relaxed, however after listening to both and EQ'ing with both, I find myself preferring the others. I don't know which are the mixing and which is the mastering set. The reason I am finding myself prefering these pads, I think, is because of the perceived extra detail from the mids and highs along with a more airy and open sense or a stage. I do understand why Sennheiser didn't have these in the 600 family, but I understand why so many have compared them, and I think there are some similarities.\n\nThe drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family (at least visually from the outside) but they provide a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the largest soundstage I’ve heard from a Sennheiser, it’s not even close. In my opinion they pull this off with a sound signature that is easy to listen to but honest and competent, and definitely a Sennheiser open back. That all being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. \n\nAs someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. \n\nWeirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop… I know what you want me to say, but I don’t hate them. They’re definitely not the headphone I’m going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I’m hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes.\n\nI absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is not floating my boat. I will be buying a new balanced cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro’s are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you’ve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I’d love to hear other’s perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I’ll get.",

The multipoint connection is just terrible.\n\nSometimes when I connect another device, the first one just disconnects for no reason. If I’m on a call and another device connects, it drops the call or randomly switches the audio back to my phone’s speakers — and then I can’t even get the sound back to Bluetooth unless I disconnect and reconnect the headphones.\n\nThe ear detection is also super inconsistent. Sometimes it pauses when I take them off, sometimes it keeps playing even when they’re around my neck. And other times, if I just tilt my head slightly, it pauses for no reason.\n\nBut the absolute worst part? Phone calls. Everyone I talk to keeps saying that they can hear all the background noise around me — sometimes even louder than my own voice. I honestly don’t understand how a company that’s supposed to be the world leader in noise cancellation can’t make headphones that handle calls properly.\n\nAnd to top it off, there’s this constant beep I get every 10 seconds when the connection to a device is lost. You can’t disable it, and it’s infuriating. It basically forces me to turn off multipoint altogether — which defeats the whole point of buying “premium” headphones that are supposed to handle multiple devices smoothly.\n\nI really wanted to love these, but between the connection issues, the unreliable ear detection, and the unusable mic for calls, I just can’t justify Bose anymore.",

    "selftext": "This week i received the DAC AMP SMSL DL200. I'm really enjoying the sound of this device, but now I'm trying an A/B Test from both outputs 6.35mm single-ended (with 3.5mm adapter) and 4.4mm \"balanced\", using the Fiio FT1 Pro. I'm not sure if is placebo, but I think I hear a better sound with the 6.35mm.\n\nI was checking ASR forum and i see the SMSL DL200 don't have a truly balanced output for the 4.4mm output, is \"pseudo-balanced\" so in theory both outputs have the same power, but I want to understand technically, why the single-ended output, in my ears, have a better sound than the pseudo-balanced 4.4mm output?",

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

Either it sounded dull, the UX was bad or I just plain didn't like using it.\n\nHaving tried mostly chinese stuff, I finally wanted to try something completly different and it paid off.\n\nMy recent purchase was the Lake People G101 a simple, anlog headphone amp. No balanced, no DSP, just a power putton, volume dial and headphone ports. I love it. This might sound silly, but I really enjoy having dedicated 3.5mm and 1/4inch ports so I never have to use an annoying adapter anymore.\n\nI rarely see products of this company anywhere online, so I wanted to share it with you all (although you might know them by their high-end brand \"Violectric\"). This costs 240€, is built like a tank and - something I also rarely see marketed about - is proud of the built-in headphone protection circuits. Let's hope I don't need them but it's nice to see thought given to that part of the device. Also designed and built in Germany for my fellow r/BuyFromEU volks.\n\nThe DAC on-top is a Topping D10s, one of the first HiFi products I got and it runs great too. What can I say: It's a DAC. Did an AB test with other DACs and couldn't tell a difference so they really don't matter in terms of sound (for me).\n\nIf I could change anything it would be the color of the DAC, both being black would be nice. But other than that I am so happy and juet feel peace with this setup. It sounds great, has lots of power and will hopefully last me a long time.",

He also had a Scarlet 2I2 sound card.\n\nIt’s been a year that we dont talk anymore and i wanted to buy the same by buying an AKG product. And so i went in with the AKG K72. However ALOT of problems have risen up Rn.\n\nThe audio sounds HORRIBLE! Its muffled, with me having to equalize the hell out of the headphone to sound the similar to my IEMs or the AKG K44. (I use the Onboard Motherboard sound card “gigabyte P110-D3” for more info) \neven then it screws my video/audio editing precision up,(volume control, General Equalization etc.) making me double check my videos twice with my IEMs. \n\nWhen I equalize it, i balance the bass but still give the cheap feeling  of when you listen to something with a bit of Bassy, the high and mids just go “low volume” mode. (Not sure that might be a sound card problem idk im new to the audio world)\n\nI was wondering if this is a fake headphone or not? And just general tips on what to do?\nThe headband just lost its stitches on its inner rubber and i had to stitch it myself (after 2 weeks of use btw).\nThe printing has some minor smudges on the font. As if they didnt paint it well, The cable feels nice tho and does not feel fake… but overall feels sketchy.\n\n(Im from iran and we dont have customer support here so i cant do anything but just look for tips here. Due to sanctions eveything is twice as expensive and banned here. Even buying stuff from amazon.)\n\nI’ve heared that if i buy a sound card (UE Volt 1) it will make it sound better, but im not sure… should it? Imean my brother’s K44 sounded amazing no matter what u plugged it into.\n\nSo what do i do?\n\nStart editing with my IEMs again?\nBuy the UE VOLT 1 sound card?\nGet a razor black shark V2X?\njust stop using the K72 entirely?\nI really dont know what to do tbh… ",

It was just very farty and anything close to normal volume made it sound extremely sad. I am not joking when I say this but an HD600 with a subbass shelf has cleaner bass. IT CANNOT DO SUBBASS EVEN STOCK.\n\nMids: actually not too bad, nothing to write home about. I honestly don't know what to say about it except for its mediocre and VERY IN YOUR FACE. Suicideboys was the only artist that sounded okay.\n\nHighs: OH BOY IT GETS WORSE, there is something real nasty goin on in the low-mid treble. This was something that could not be fixed with mods or whatever I did. Maybe it's a reflection or resonance from the driver cover? I tried everything in the book and I could not fix it.\nBut anyway, the treble wasn't fun. It was a hazy mess, any track sounded sharp and not detailed at the same time. I can accept being slightly piercing IF there is a good amount of detail output.\n\nThe baseline is that there are WAYYY better cans at the same price. I have also seen DMS recommending them and I can sort of understand why since his listening volume is extremely low (compared to mine) and doesn't run into the same distortion problems (I think).",

All over this sub, and other IEM subs have repeatedly said, \"If you can get it loud enough then you don't need an amp!\" LIES!\n\nI went to a headphone shop today, I brought my own dongle DAC/Amp. Tried a bunch of headphones. You know what? Yes I could get the demo units up to par listening volume. It was loud enough. Didn't even need to get to 80% volume for it to be loud. Huh, sounds decent.\n\nThen the guy said to try it with a dedicated desktop amp. I plugged it in, and lo' and behold, the audio is richer, soundstage is bigger, the headphones came ALIVE. Before, it was tinny and flat, but loud enough. Crazily, with the amp, the volume was actually set lower. Did I volume match? No, but I didn't need to because I could hear the difference before I got to the same volume. \n\nI always turn the volume down to zero before swapping anything.

    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n→ Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n→ Punchy bass.  \n→ Delicious female vocals.  \n→ Soundstage above average.  \n→ No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n→ DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n→ If you are a purist, stay away.  \n→ Mids somewhat soft.  \n→ Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30€/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a “more and better.”\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:** present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:** this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:** here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:** somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:** maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:** with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:** substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:** too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:** I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:** at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:** placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:** keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:** could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:** testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko’s character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos’ voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:** testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once… I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:** dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:** not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:** paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:** I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it’s unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that “I’m going to make you have fun” vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/hzhh291a74yf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1330b369663156fd2593bc89c456bd2a8ca3e1fb\n\nHi everyone:\n\nI used both the QCC Pro and BTD700 dongles to test various codecs (aptX, aptX Adaptive, AAC, and SBC) and noticed some distortion in the high frequencies—especially with piano tracks. This makes me suspect that my iPhone 17 Pro might have a defect in its audio chip or a related component. When I played the same songs on my older iPhone 13 Pro using AAC, there was no distortion. Unfortunately, I don’t have a Lightning dongle, so I couldn’t test aptX on the older phone. And also I have dropout problem when using both dongle.Does anyone else with an iPhone 17 series notice these issues?\n\nMy personal experience with these three little friends:\n\nYou really can’t go wrong with either dongle.\n\nQCC Pro\n\nHas its own app with a much better UX design. The slim form factor fits perfectly on a phone or tablet. Looks more premium in person (the photos make it seem cheaper than it is). Comes with only one dongle — I originally thought there were two (one for the phone and one for the headphones that communicate directly), which would’ve justified the higher price over the BTD700. The packaging design is a bit misleading.\n\nBTD700\n\nWorks great for home or office use.Doesn’t have a mobile app, but there’s one for PC/Mac. Sadly, I couldn’t update the firmware no matter what system I used. But it works. One simple button does everything you need.\n\nIn terms of sound, they’re very similar. I can only tell the difference when comparing side by side — the QCC Pro’s mids are slightly louder and more forward.\n\nIf you like the QCC Pro’s design but prefer the BTD700’s price, check out the QCC Standard (white) version. I believe only Bloom Audio carries it, and they’re an awesome retailer. Please remember, Only QCC PRO Has LDAC.\n\nAbout the PX8 S2\n\nThey’re extremely comfortable. My head circumference is about 21.5\", and I’m very sensitive — even picky — about anything pressing on my head (I can’t stand most beanies). But I can wear the PX8 S2 for long sessions with no problem. My old XM3s and AirPods Max felt like Jigsaw’s traps in comparison.\n\nThe leather is incredibly soft — genuinely reminiscent of Hermès leather. If you or your HAPPY WIFE have Hermès bags, you’ll know what I mean.\n\nAs for sound quality, the PX8 S2 really shines with large-scale or orchestral music. That doesn’t mean they’re not good for solo performances — I love listening to Yo-Yo Ma with them. For pop music, it’s more about personal preference. The sound is very balanced — I like it a lot, but as I like to say, I like drinking water… and you might not.\n\n\\*I use gpt to make my post more readable and I also post this review on B&W subreddit. Any advice or question are welcome\n\n",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/2flmc5e914yf1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=70db2ea529ba5f5b1230ac28b4d91c7ec2cfedce\n\nSo, I want to talk about DACs. Personally, I’m not a believer in all that snake oil — people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don’t buy it. And honestly, I don’t think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I’ve always thought that if there’s any difference, it’s basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time — I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a “bigger soundstage,” I just assume it’s because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I’m open-minded — I’ll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that’s matched, everything else — bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging — sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I’m out. Either they’re trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don’t. In either case, their opinions don’t mean much to me anymore, because I can’t hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let’s talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn’t tell exactly what at first, but it didn’t feel like my imagination. After more testing — switching headphones, replaying the same tracks — I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head — especially those higher notes — in a way the K7 doesn’t. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that’s somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it’s like their voice locks into one spot — more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** — and I can’t believe I’m saying this — it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you — same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat’s not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer’s right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste — some benefit from that extra space, some don’t. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** — *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn’t huge, but it’s there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It’s actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it’s slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less “exciting.” The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah — I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It’s pricey, and there’s no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat’s my honest take.",

That one had connectivity issues straight out of the box: every time I'd move or turn my head *even slightly*, the connection would quit and I'd have to unplug and re-plug them in again.\n\nEventually I got tired of this and bought a *third* set. Which also, immediately out of the box, gave me the same issue.

    "title": "Advice for the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs 80ohm Headphones",
    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

This is usually resolved by installing the USB DAC driver provided by the maker, but [SMSL does not have such a driver for the R1](https://www.smsl-audio.com/portal/product/downlist/id/11.html).\n\nThe sound when the treble/bass sliders are set to flat and EQ is set to 1 (neutral) is decent, soundstage is wide and imaging is pleasing. I would say it sounds as good as any good dongle DAC out there. The volume dial stepping is digital, and its 0% volume rest position is around 8 o'clock but audio cannot be heard until the dial moves to just above 8 o'clock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unh2e5uyb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=543c5fadfb1cc44339cf3758d73cf601b3a33d75\n\nWhen all processing is flat/off there is no noticeable distortion even at high volume on both HE1000se and HD600. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih4wc1k5c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=729948d649f5ce4ddf421d1be1c21acebfcce333\n\nThe power output is 130mW so quite low, but it's capable of driving both headphones just fine and loud.\n\nWhen you enable any EQ or adjust the tone controls, distortion comes in at higher volumes especially noticed in songs with bass or audio with bass, so for gamers playing shooters, this is a big issue if you want to tone control or use one of the better EQ presets as flat is just that and lacks any smoothness/warmth in sound signature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j87meo97c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76683158a5dc1f033677e071151592f4e455520c\n\nUsing it is a DAC only and pre-amp using the RCA outputs to the power amp it does an OK job although there is noticeable noise floor interference that can be heard, just like what I found with the Creek 4040A a while back. Seems the analogue circuitry is not isolated.\n\nI then plugged in the RCA interconnect between the X9 and power amp to test and heard no noticeable interference noise. In this config the power amp was set to bypass and R1 used as pre-amp, in pure DAC mode and volume controlling via the power amp, the same noise can be heard once you increase the power amp's volume, the R1's volume is maxed out in this test to imitate bypass and be DAC only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r54td2q8c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3de0a8271051809a0c92c11c9a8c9092c9be0307\n\nIt is priced at $71 currently, I think if you must have a desktop sitting box to use and interact with then ok it's fine, but these caveats have to be considered. Otherwise I would say the ONIX Alpha XI1 offers better sound with none of the distortion issues or noise etc at a slightly higher price and offers more power, lower THD+N.\n\nThe other advantage of the R1 though is it has dedicated mic input, although if you are a gamer you almost certainly have a USB mic or headset anyway so this is not really a selling factor.\n\nThe volume dial is super slick though, there is that....\n\nI was unable to open up the housing properly for a teardown as even with all the screws out, I could not lift out the top panel with the sliders properly without fearing breaking something. Either it is glued on, or there is a method to it.",

I forgot my IEMs going into the office the other day, so I set up the BT for music and HOT DAMN.\n  \nWith ANC on these are absolute bass cannons. The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these. If you're a fellow bass head and need something for a job with remote communication, 10/10 I suggest these.",

But they seem to be lacking \"openness\" and some space.

Can this bass be EQ’d?\n\nThe XS sounded perfect, but the Ananda Nano sounded a bit boomy. But on every other track, the bass sounded tight and great, and there was just more separation and overall clarity on the Ananda Nano. But people kept saying it's like an analytical, dry headphone.

The earcups themselves have RGB lighting that you can activate or keep OFF, and when the RGB lights are OFF the headphones just look like any other headphone. When turned ON, they give some sort of gaming vibes which is confusing since these are supposed to be sold to DJs so it doesn’t seem like the target is well-defined, at least if we speak about lighting only. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knkv19g411yf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a782c04a5cdf3988d4358633ff85fbc2be306cb3\n\nThe overall build quality is solid, the sliders look and feel sturdy, the earcups themselves have about 90°C swivel on the back and and a couple degrees of swivel on the front as well to grant some headroom for proper fit and the overall softness of the pads and headband cushion is decent. The headphones are also foldable and this makes up for an easy-to-carry set, even though they sit quite awkwardly in the storage case.  The comfort itself is pretty good from my own experience, just be aware that the pleather pads could become pretty warm during summer or hot periods in general.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omubezl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10a9cf8e2c43f1a1950eb07df223cd4aed1cf480\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0ozhzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfcc854db3fd68d9f35ff467f2d33782027dd5bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8rgrzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826ba7f50c9920c089b54a0447621625ffde6a38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5ckyyl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=609c2127c547e2efb3f8dfc959c2c34f4c1fa761\n\nThe buttons on the earcups are responsive and they don’t cheap when clicked since there’s enough tension to them, even though the sound coming from them could have been a bit more muted in order to feel more “premium” (but that’s just a nitpick, nothing else).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/poj54dc711yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89863a313cd6087121e7fb116333aab9eb5c1eb9\n\n# Battery Life and Connectivity\n\nThe battery life is pretty good yet not the best you can find in this price range (especially considering that the Ardor exist) good, and although I didn’t have the chance to test the full 45  hours with ANC ON and RGB lighting OFF, I have done some testing and noted the remaining battery life after some listening.\n\nAfter 30 hours of listening with no charge between multiple sessions, the battery life displayed on my phone’s bluetooth settings for the Aventus was 29%, meaning that 71% of the battery was consumed in the first 30 hours of listening. Hypothesizing the same usage, which involved slightly different volume levels, ANC ON and RGB OFF and random calls here and there, we can assume that about 10 more hours of listening will consume the remaining battery life (more or less).\n\nSure, these aren’t objective measurements in optimal conditions (mixed usage, various volume levels, a couple calls here and there) but these are respectable numbers from my point of view.\n\nSomething that I cannot understand is the reason why a DJ would use these with bluetooth, since although these are shipped with a couple wires to use them wired, they are still promoted as DJ headphones, hence it’s pretty confusing that you have RGB lighting and bluetooth (I can understand ANC, instead, since it could help isolating from external noises during live sets).\n\nSo, you can use these wired connecting them to your amp or DJ console/controller, or you can use them in bluetooth mode: in this regard,I haven’t experienced any issues, disconnections or other types of problems related to pairing and/or connecting to the headphones, both in single point and multi-point mode. Just make sure you pair every single device singularly before using them in multi-point mode and you’ll be fine.\n\n# ANC/Transparency feature, Latency and Commands\n\nThe ANC of the Kiwi Ears Aventus is okay, and even though you’re not getting Bose-like ANC you’re still getting some isolation that will avoid super high volumes just to get rid of the surrounding noises. The passive isolation is pretty good as well so those in combination do the job, especially considering Just like with the Ardor, I have noticed a weird behaviour of the ANC when I’m on the bus and the bus itself meets some street bumps along the way: in those cases, the ANC makes some annoying pops that I have already heard when using my KZ Carol TWS. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s something worth mentioning.\n\nThe transparency feature works well, it doesn’t emphasize things too much making them almost “artificial” and I think it’s definitely usable. I have used sets with a better transparency mode, but I think this is on-point and accomplishes the task pretty well.\n\nThe latency is there, I am not gonna lie, and even using the low-latency mode it still isn’t low enough to make hassle-free gaming possible: if you’re playing games and want a wireless set, I don’t think this is the right one, it’s just better to buy a headset with proprietary 2.4GHz dongle since universal bluetooth connectivity has its own limits (and these don’t even have AptX to compensate for them).\n\nThe commands are responsive and easy to understand, and haven’t encountered any issue in this regard.\n\n# Sound\n\n**GEAR USED FOR THE TEST**\n\n* Mobile phones: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Xiaomi Mi A3, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n* Laptop and Desktop PC with Bluetooth 5.1 USB adapter\n* Lenovo Chromebook Duet\n\n**Let’s talk about the sound**\n\nI will be talking about the Aventus with ANC ON and Music Mode ON.\n\nThe Aventus are mostly balanced with some added bass, a relaxed upper midrange and slightly boosted treble response (not fatiguing though). Depending on your head-size and on how they fit and clamp on your head, you’re going to have slight deviations from what I am saying and that is probably one of the weaknesses of this product. The main issue, in fact, is that very small positioning differences on my head lead to sound differences that I struggle to explain, so it was a very inconsistent experience in my case and a very hard product to review. \n\nTo me, the Aventus are okay, with an overall balanced response that never gets overdone in a specific part of the response. The bass, for example, is not overcooked or muffled, nor is it too thick/overpowering, and it’s there in the right quantity with average speed. It’s not very textured yet not super fat to the point that you don’t hear any texture in it, if that makes sense.  \nThe lower midrange has some added warmth even though the midbass isn’t rich enough to empower the lower mids, so the lower mids are probably boosted by the tuner to warm things up a bit without the need of pushing the bass more than that. The upper mids, instead, aren’t fatiguing and they never become hot, and I’d say that they’re not as emphasized as on your average Harman-tuned headphone.  \nThe treble isn’t fatiguing but there’s some spice here and there to avoid darkness, even though the highs definitely feel like something is missing up top (some details and sparkle, for example). The mid-treble can get a bit peaky at times also and this makes some cymbals slightly unnatural or splashy and some “S” sounds a bit sharp occasionally.  \nUsing the spare foams included in the box can attenuate the treble even more, although I don’t really find these annoying.  \n  \nThe soundstage isn’t very spacious, but it’s okay for a closed back set, and the imaging is also okay overall. Nothing to write home about I’d say but no true bad words to spend here either. \n\nTurning OFF the ANC gives the sound a warmer tint, the mid-treble emphasis is tamed a bit and the headphones become a touch more controlled and relaxed, even though they are still mildly V-shaped. The soundstage and imaging remain intact.\n\nClicking the ANC button twice activates the gaming mode, which kinda makes the bass tighter and gives a more V-shaped tinge to the sound with slightly tighter and less thick bass and more treble emphasis. I’d say it helps a bit with spatial cues in game even though a pair of KSC75 or similar stuff will still give you cleaner positional cues, period.\n\n**Microphone quality**\n\nThe microphone quality is passable, nothing that screams high quality but I’d say it’s usable for calls and similar stuff. The noise cancellation is overall pretty strong, which is good news, although sometimes it cuts out some parts of my voice trying to eliminate the surrounding noises.  \nHere you have an example of the microphone quality:\n\n# Some comparisons: \n\n**Kiwi Ears Ardor vs Kiwi Ears Aventus**\n\n>With ANC ON, both are tendentially bassy and warm-sounding with average technical performance. However, the Aventus goes for a warmer presentation up top, with less upper midrange and less low-end as well. The main issue, in my opinion, is that the response relies too much on the positioning of the headphones on the head, leading to an inconsistent listening experience that I found dealbreaking. The technical performance of the Aventus is also inferior compared to the Ardor and varies with positioning on the head. The Ardor sound less loud even at higher volumes compared to the Aventus. In terms of overall value, the Ardor are a lot more specific, they look and feel like a more well-thought product and target the average casual user who wants a portable, comfortable and bassy headphone for the day-to-day commuting, whereas the Aventus are still confusing to me: they have RGB to appeal gamers, the DJ design to appeal DJs, but they somehow have a sort of “inconsistent” sound experience which is not ideal for DJs since they never stay in the same position when they’re performing (source: I used to DJ as well so I know what I am talking about). In addition, the Ardor has better battery life so it’s the smarter choice between the two if you don’t wanna charge it as frequently as you’d do with the Aventus (not that their battery life is bad but the Ardor have better battery life and that’s objective).  \nIn my opinion, the Ardor gives you something more for your money and it’s a sleeker and more comfortable set for everyday use. The Aventus are not “bad” per se, but some quirks make them less recommendable than the similarly priced Ardor, which are a lot more consistent no matter how you wear them and truly feel like something that was designed a touch better.\n\n**Kiwi Ears Aventus vs Sony WH-1000XM5**\n\n>Very different price yet maybe someone could be curious to compare a couple different options. To me, both sound a touch unnatural, but there are a couple key differences.   \nThe XM5 sound more V-shaped with brighter treble and a lot more low-end (even too much at times). However, they almost sound the same everytime I wear them whereas the Aventus are kinda inconsistent so the perceived level of bass and treble kinda depends on the fit. In terms of overall technical performance, I think there aren’t big differences even though the XM5 sound sometimes more resolving due to the brighter treble (it’s more of a “perceived” clarity” up top but it doesn’t really translate into a better opinion from my side).  \nThe comfort is good on both sets but the WH-1000XM5 sit on my head way better and are more stable. In terms of passive isolation and ANC, the WH-1000XM5 easily takes the lead.  \nIn terms of overall customization through the app, bluetooth codecs and so on, the WH-1000XM5 easily win. However, I’d say the battery life of the Aventus is one of their strengths (even though you have to count the worse ANC and so on).  \nThe price is very different and although the sound signatures are different, the sum-up of this comparison is that spending more will give you a more refined and well-though product.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus aren't revolutionary nor do they set new standards. It's a set that has some fit issues that lead to an inconsistent sound, so everyone's experience may vary depending on the size of the head, on how the headphones are placed on the head, and it's probably the biggest fault of this product.  \nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus score a 3/5 from me, which may seem like a bad vote but that is a 6/10 that hopefully will convert into a better rank if they'll ever release a sequel with better overall consistency. The sound is pretty pleasant, the comfort is nice, the headphones are foldable and they should appeal to many users, but the target market itself is also confusing so it's another thing that makes them less \"specific\".  \nSome say \"Don't bite off more than you can chew\", and this is probably the way I'd like to end my review: I think Kiwi Ears is able to appeal most of the people out there but they should not do that with a single product. It's much better to carefully design a product targeted to very specific users rather than trying to make one that has to appeal many people without excelling in anything particular for those specific users.  \n  \nThanks Kiwi Ears for starting the journey in over-ear headphones, this is a welcomed choice and hopefully we'll see even more competition in the full-size cans' market space.  \n",

    "title": "Aune AR5000: Avoid them. Cheap plastic designed to break.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I don't talk on here very often but I had been searching for headphones after my last pair which lasted me about 13 years (Sennheiser HD598's) and still worked fine.\n\nI settled on the Aune AR5000's because they fit my pricepoint. I got them, EQ'd them and fell in love with that nice creamy bass.\n\nThat was exactly 14 months ago. For my usage I babied them, was always gentle despite the feeling of sturdy construction, and adored them. Never dropped.\n\nI have a small'ish to medium head. When I would use my pc I would simply pick them up and put them on like any other headphone.\n\nToday I wake up and the absolute weirdest thing happen, I went to put them on but they weren't... feeling right, I checked and YEP, they had cracked from soft usage after a year. I had seen other users with the pin for the ear support coming out because it was plastic but thought it would never happen to me because I'm so gentle with them.\n\nI have emailed my retailer and aune to see what they say but I'm pretty sure I'm SOL.\n\nMy advice? DO NOT BUY. This isn't a quality control problem, its a design and fundamental flaw in having that section made from plastic.\n\nI'm livid and now have to go searching for new headphones AGAIN.\n\n\n\nEDIT: If aune refuse to help I will investigate the replacement bands, or just outright upgrade to a pair of Meze 105's\n\nThese headphones were great for gaming and music and I feel the 105's have a better looking construction.\n\nAlso after plugging my over decade old HD598's they sound almost as good as the Aune AR5000's. So I think my over-enthusiasm for their sound might have been for reasons I can't explain. These are 90% the headphone sound of them and considering the age of them, that's hilarious.",

    "title": "Arya Organic…Wow",
    "selftext": "My thoughts on the Arya Organics (I know there’s plenty of reviews etc, but what harm can another do)\n\nI jumped into this hobby about 2 years ago roughly. Through that time, I’ve been through plenty headphones, but the only ones I spent a LOT of time with was 2. The Arya Stealth, and the HD560s. \n\n(Skip further down if you don’t care about the previous stories)\n\nThe Stealths were mind blowing to me, I did have planars before these. The edition xs (felt way too cheap for the 300 mark at the time. The Ananda Nanos (clamped like a vice). So picked up the Arya Stealths for £710, which was their cheapest price at the time. I owned these for 6 months. Every time I put them on, I was astounded at the sound. However, after 2 months, I rarely used them, I didn’t have the time to listen, and didn’t want £700 lying around. So I reluctantly sold them, and decided to pick up the cheaper pair, the HD560s. So I could still enjoy music, without feeling guilty having some premium set collecting dust. And these were fine, for £90, they were great.\n\nRecently however I’m now in a position where I have a lot more free time, and for that reason, I wanted to pick up a higher end headphone again. I was debating between many, but in the end it kept boiling down to the Stealths, which were now £460. But then saw the Organics were just £120 extra as “open-box” from Hifiman. One thing I absolutely hated with the Stealths was how harsh some of the treble was, and at the time I didn’t have EQ. So I was stuck with harsh treble in a few songs I enjoyed other times. Between owning the 560s and Stealths, I did pick up the JDS Element 4 Dac/Amp in preparation for higher end cans in the future, and to play around with EQ. So hearing the Organics had a harsh treble, it didn’t really deter me as I had the capabilities to town it down.\n\nSo now onto the Organics…\n\nLOOKS:\nThese things are absolutely gorgeous! It’s like taking your grandads beautifully varnished wooden table and chairs, and adding a modern touch to it. It makes them stand out and look far more premium than the price suggests (I’m aware they were 1500 odd on release, but on current pricing, the point stands). They feel more premium for this matter. I the one massive negative, is you have to wear them to listen, meaning I can’t just stare at them when in use. \n\nCOMFORT:\nAnyone who’s familiar with the Arya lineup, know that this line of headphones are on the comfier side of the Hifiman brand. They clamp just enough to not feel loose, but not too hard that it feels like the hulk is crushing your skull (Nanos). Yes the pads aren’t the most comfy pads on any headphone, they’re actually the one aspect I don’t like. They don’t feel premium, and the fabric design sometimes catches the odd strand of hair which isn’t pleasant. However changing these means altering the sound, which you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT, want to do. The headband is perfect though. Suspended straps are my favourite on headphones, adds a premium feel, look and feels like far less pressure on your head. Not to mention how wide they are, it helps distribute the weight so well.\n\nUNBOXING: \nDead, £5 unboxing experience, but realistically who cares…\n\nSOUND:\nGrand. Exciting. Smooth. \n\nThe 3 words I’d use to describe the sound. Which goes to show how versatile they are. They give off such a ‘grand’ feeling, when you listen to orchestral pieces, it feels like you’re in a theatre listening to a band playing, but like you’re middle row. Not first row where it feels in your face, and not back row that it feels like it’s far away. It’s that perfect middle ground where it’s around you, but so that you can hear everything so cleanly. They’re exciting in the sense that after an orchestral piece, you put on an EDM track, pop or anything in that region, and it feels like you want to get up and just dance, but don’t, as these probably would fall off your head. And then you go for a very vocal focused piece of music, and the smoothness of the voice just glides through your ears. There’s no moment where it’s aggressive (unless it needs to be) or where it holds back. It’s like an electric supercar. You put your foot down, and it picks up straight away, but with no aggression, just picks up and gets going right away. \n\nOnto the specifics:\n\nBASS - Very solid. Definitely stronger than the Arya Stealths. When I had them, the bass was there, but it needed a tad more punch. These add that very subtle punch, where you know it’s bass, but it doesn’t slip into the other frequencies and overthrow them. It’s controlled VERY well. The sub bass is fantastic too. My favourite song to test this is “The Droid Invasion and the Appearance of Darth Maul” from The Phantom Menace. The drums at the start provide that sub bass test and it really shows how it handles it well. Doesn’t get fatiguing, just presents it so smoothly. Not to mention how clear the drums sound, like you can visualise the fabric drum stick hitting against the massive drum. The bass is also quick when needing to be. In many pop songs where there is the common use of bass, or in rap music, it’ll show the bass, and stop it perfectly. It never feels like it over presents itself. They also hold the bass off so well from overpowering the mids. Many headphones either make the bass so minimal that you don’t realise there should be bass, and many push it so hard it dims down the vocals. These control it so so well.\n\nMIDS - I would say the weakest out of the Low, Mid and High ends. Definitely NOT bad, it’s really really great. However when there is consistent bass present, and a lot of higher end or many many instruments playing, the vocals definitely take a seat back. They’re still very clear, but it pushes the instruments forward a bit more. Which isn’t bad at all, and some people may prefer this. It’s more of a preference thing. I certainly don’t mind it, and it’s not something I’m gonna be quickly to go and EQ, but if I was, it’s the first thing I’d play with, just to bring them forward a touch. BUT, when there’s only a low end and vocals, or high end and vocals, they are stunning. They just sound so real and ‘organic’, it’s like having a conversation with David Attenborough, just so nicely spoken and a voice you wish could commentate on your whole life. \n\nHIGHS - Lies were told here, or obviously it’s just down to personal hearing. But these are NOT ‘peaky’ or ‘harsh’. The high end is so well controlled. With the Arya Stealth, I absolutely could not listen to Nightcall - Kavinsky from Drive. The chorus of the song was so harsh I literally couldn’t listen to it. So the first song I wanted to try was that, and on these I could listen to the entire song with no issues. They have just enough brightness to make everything sound clean and clear, but not too much that it comes across as piercing during songs. Same with Time - Pink Floyd. The start with all the clocks can be very piercing with poorly controlled highs, but it’s like the headphones actively know it’s going to sound harsh and presents them just a tone down so that you don’t have to turn the volume down or skip forward. It was my one worry with these, and although EQ is an option, I did want to enjoy them stock for as long as possible. Which I’m ecstatic with the fact I can.\n\nSOUNDSTAGE - Wide, but not artificially wide, just naturally wide. Like I said with the orchestral hall and being “grand”. It just sounds so perfectly deep. It’s not like the sound is coming from across the room, but it’s not like the song is being played right next to you. It’s similar to car speakers, in the way it’s all round you, but not as if you’re listening to the persons car next to you. It’s intimate enough that you feel like it’s YOUR music, not someone else’s near you, but also distant enough that it’s like it’s your own personal concert. \n\nSEPARATION - Always tough because if a song is produced badly, even the greatest ever headphones won’t be able to separate the parts. But in a well produced track, you can actively hear each and every instrument and voice. In “Call it what you want” by Taylor Swift, there’s many instances where there are backing vocals playing over Taylor, and you can hear each one clearly, but as if they’re actually behind her. Like Taylor’s singing into your ear, whilst the backing singer is sat 2 foot behind her also singing, but you can clearly tell one is the main, one is the backing. The 560s definitely struggled with this, you often couldn’t hear the multiple voices, so now listening to many songs, I’m hearing voices I didn’t realise were there (I actually checked on 2 occasions that I wasn’t listening to a remix).\n\nConclusion:\nYes. Just yes. Stellar\n\nSetup I’m using:\nHifiman Arya Organic -> JDS Element 4 -> MacBook M3 -> Audirvana (because Tidal is buggy as anything on Mac since iOS 26 and Apple Music doesn’t auto change the Sample Rate) \n",

    "selftext": "Hi guys, here’s my review of the Hifiman Ananda Stealth V3. I bought these myself as it seemed like a pretty good deal at around $200 with discount codes.\n\nThe Ananda Stealth has a slightly warm tonality. It’s very non-fatiguing and quite balanced. Details are apparent and clearly heard in the background, it doesn’t try to push it up right in your face. Soundstage is okay, not super wide but imaging is good.\n\nFor $200, I think the Ananda Stealths are one of the best valued open headphones. I don’t think I heard anything that sounds as all rounded for $200. I think they’re great for someone who prioritizes sound quality. In terms of build and comfort, it’s just okay, afterall that’s not Hifiman’s strength.",

    "title": "Flux FA-10: Brutal Power, \"Nervous\" Character",
    "selftext": "​I was looking for a powerful and clean-sounding Solid State (SS) amplifier for my HE6se V2 headphones when I stumbled upon this Flux FA-10 on sale for €350 shipped. So, I pulled the trigger. Now I'm here with this Class A \"beast,\" capable of delivering a staggering 16W into 32 ohms (10.5W into 64 ohms).\n​Overall, the sound was... adequate. But let me unpack this a little bit further.\n\n\n**​An Aggressive Presentation**\n\n​I don't want to complain about the cleanliness and detail this unit brings to the table on some (though not all) of my headphones, but I genuinely dislike its aggressive and 'in your face' presentation. \nIt sounds tense, like a nervous person trying to tell a fairy tale to a child. Granted, I'm coming from tube amps like my Eufonika OTL, or the relaxed sound of the Mojo 2, but... I wasn't expecting this kind of house sound from Flux.\nI usually associate Class A with a slightly warm character and a rolled-off treble, which this device is definitively not.\n\n\n**​Lack of Dynamics on Elex and HE6**\n\n​The HE6 and the Elex are among the most punchy and dynamic headphones on the market. The Elex can sound punchy even if connected to a [potato](https://www.instructables.com/Potato-Battery-Understanding-Chemical-and-Electric/), and the HE6 demands significant power to fully express its dynamic nature.\nNevertheless, with the FA-10, both headphones sound unimpressive dynamically, especially the Elex, which really surprised me.\nI usually plug them into an Aliexpress dongle or the Chord Mojo 2 and am always satisfied with the bass impact.\n​The Elex's punchiness seems irrecoverable even with EQ, which only introduces mud into the sound. The HE6, however, can regain some of its impact through equalization.\n\n\n***​Note***: It is important not to confuse the role of EQ. It can add bass quantity, but the violence of the attack of a bass note is what dictates its physical impact. This is a physical characteristic that does not solely relate to the Frequency Response (FR). For example, the FiiO FT1 has much more bass than the Elex, but it sounds way less punchy.\n\n​The Elex sounds somewhat muddy and poorly controlled compared to the Mojo 2, while the HE6 sounds largely as its graph suggests.\n\n\n**Decent ​Synergy with the HD660S2**\n\n​The Sennheiser HD660S2 has a very relaxed sound signature (with some sparkle around 6-8kHz). They actually sound good with this amp because it balances their chill presentation, occasionally making them sound aggressive too.\n\n\n**​Strengths Worth Highlighting**\n\n​Despite my criticisms, I want to highlight the amp's strengths:\n- ​Incredible Power: It runs my HE6se V2 on low gain, using only 3/4 of the volume knob.\n- ​Pristine Cleanliness and Detail: The sound is dead clean and highly detailed.\n- ​Stage and Separation: The stage is a decent, medium size, and the imaging and instrumental separation are top-notch for the price.\n- Flexible Inputs: It accepts balanced inputs, but since it's a pure single-ended device, both the SE and balanced outputs should sound virtually the same. This is a great feature, making the FA-10 more flexible regarding the source you feed it.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n​Ultimately, I would never recommend this amp to people sensitive to the 3-4kHz region like myself. This amplifier is a cannon for those frequencies (from a presentation standpoint). If you have a warm and relaxed headphone, it can truly wake it up. But for neutral to bright headphones, especially aggressive ones like the HE6 and Elex... proceed at your own risk!\n",

    "title": "A New Study on the Equivalence of Harman OE Target on Modern Test Fixtures, Co-authored by Sean Olive and Dan Clark Audio",
    "selftext": "> Summarized by Qwen.\n\nFor years, the *Harman target*—a frequency response profile derived from extensive double-blind listening tests—has served as a benchmark for “neutral” or preferred headphone sound. Originally defined using a specific GRAS 45CA test fixture equipped with a custom “Welti” pinna and an RA045 (Type 3.3) ear simulator, this target has become widely referenced in both research and product development.\n\nHowever, a critical issue has emerged: many modern labs and manufacturers now use newer test fixtures—such as the **GRAS 45CA-10** (with KB5000 anthropomorphic pinna and RA0402 ear simulator) and the **Brüel & Kjær Type 5128** (featuring a Type 4.3 ear simulator compliant with ITU-T P.57). These fixtures differ acoustically from the original Harman setup, particularly in their **acoustic transfer impedance**, especially below 500 Hz and above 3 kHz. Applying the original Harman target directly to measurements from these newer systems can lead to misinterpretation—and potentially misguided tuning decisions.\n\nIn a new paper presented at the **AES 159th Convention** (October 2025), **Sean Olive** (the architect of the Harman target) and **Dan Clark** address this problem head-on. Their work defines *Harman-equivalent targets* specifically calibrated for the GRAS 45CA-10 and B&K 5128 fixtures, ensuring that headphones tuned to these revised targets will sound subjectively similar to those tuned to the original Harman reference.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe authors measured seven diverse headphones including open-back and closed-back models from Dan Clark Audio, HiFiMan, and Sennheiser—on all three fixtures (original Welti, GRAS 45CA-10, and B&K 5128). Using a straightforward calibration method in Room EQ Wizard (REW), they derived fixture-specific targets by:\n\n1. Measuring each headphone on both the original and new fixtures.\n2. Computing the ratio between responses (e.g., KB5000 / Welti).\n3. Applying this ratio to the original Harman target (phase-conjugated and smoothed) to generate a new, equivalent target.\n\nThis process accounts for the unique acoustic loading and leakage characteristics of each fixture.\n\n## Listening Tests Confirm Validity\n\nTo validate the approach, the team conducted controlled **MUSHRA-style listening tests** with 13 experienced listeners, comparing seven versions of the target:\n\n- The original Harman target (Reference)\n- Fixture-specific targets calibrated per headphone\n- Targets averaged across 7 or 20 headphones\n\nResults were clear: when headphones were equalized to their **fixture-specific, individually calibrated targets**, they sounded **nearly identical** to the original Harman reference. In statistical terms, the **B&K 5128** and **GRAS 45CA-10** targets (calibrated per model) were **not significantly different** from the reference in perceived similarity.\n\nBy contrast, targets derived from **averages across multiple headphones** (e.g., “5128_20”) scored lower—though still within the “very similar” range—highlighting that **individual calibration yields the best match**.\n\nInterestingly, the type of headphone (open vs. closed-back) had minimal impact on results, suggesting the method is robust across designs.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nFor engineers and audiophiles alike, this work resolves a long-standing ambiguity: **you cannot directly apply the classic Harman target to measurements taken on modern fixtures** and expect accurate tuning. Instead, fixture-specific equivalents are needed.\n\nEncouragingly, the differences between targets are often correctable with **simple bass and treble shelving filters**, as most deviations occur in well-defined frequency regions. This opens the door for more consistent, cross-platform headphone evaluation—and more reliable interpretations of published measurements.\n\nWhile the study focused on seven models, the calibration framework is generalizable. Future work may yield standardized correction targets for common fixtures, enabling broader adoption without per-headphone measurement.\n\n## Reference\n\nOlive, S., & Clark, D.

It's fine on a few people but a lot of us won't get as much or as good bass as we should. The Audeze headband really help in this area. It's still quite v-shape headphones but really enjoyable for K/J-pop or ani-song.",

    "title": "Audeze LCD5 with EQ is .... WOW (what took me so long)",
    "selftext": "So Ive had a couple of superb  headphones, of which my favorites have been the U12T Iem, Utopia 2022, KSE1200, yet none touch the speaker setup, but thats more to do with physicality.  Anyways, I always loved the technicality of the LCD5 for mixing but hated its tonality for music enjoyment, as its not enjoyable relative to the Utopia, or even the U12t.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xict0bc0iyf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd00e3b32336bb99067869b285106ebc701b94c9\n\nAnyways having recently gotten the U12Ts I was very impressed, as they are pretty damn technical, yet also enjoyable for music enjoyment, and dont require EQ or anything.   I used to EQ the KSE1200 for example which I still think performs technically better than anything else I have, but its a pain....  So that comparison is what got me curious about WHAT IF I spend some time to EQ the LCD5 with a phase linear plugin.\n\nANYWAYS, this is what this post is about:\n\nThe U12T got me curious about adding EQ to the LCD5, and then I saw other people often complain about the LCD5 until they EQ it.  I used the Utopia 2022, as a reference for a tuning I enjoy.  I found in mac the app soundSource allows me to use some of the same software I use for mixing and mastering, to EQ these things.   After EQing it, it punches like the Utopia, but the resolution is still that of the most detailed headphone I have ever heard. Im gonna get hate for this, but even the Stax SR009 doesnt do bass like the LCD5 (or at least I imagine as I dont have them side by side, but I remember it doesnt do bass like the Utopia in terms of weight). With EQ the LCD5 is just WOW.   Now the downside however is this is a pain in the ass to have to setup.\n\nThe setup:\n\n•⁠  ⁠I  found a software in the MAC called soundsource that allows applying corrective curves and also some of the same plugins used for mastering.\n\n•⁠  ⁠On the above software Audeze LCD-5 was setup to Oratory reference.  This corrects some imbalances but also sounds a bit dull next to the Utopia when set to the same curve for example.\n\n•⁠  ⁠To correct that, I then follow this by adding a hi pass WAY below the hearing range at 16hz to help the driver work better not dealing with stuff I cannot hear anyways.   Then I re-add some of the frequencies in the 2.6k nd 5.1k (only about 2-3db), which are frequencies dulled by the oratory curve, in this headphone. This brings a bit of that character I like in vocals in the Utopia, but smooth like the LCD5's are good at.\n\nThe LCD5 can take HUGE gain vai EQ without distorting. Its honestly really impressive.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02k9l6yk0iyf1.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=92b89d90635e2e02a6427c642433eeac833cb9b7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8f6te6yk0iyf1.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=009b587ecf81fffbbfaf2f95aa2aa5bdae0c7732",

    "selftext": "I know this has been beat to death multiple times with multiple sticks, but I was scrapin' the web and didn't end up satisfied - was looking for some more opinions. \n\nI have owned my HD600's for awhile now - a few years probably, and they were one of my first non-completely-crap headphones after using some ear splitty Sony's and BD's. I originally got them for mixing, as I was not really into audiophile listening with headphones (had decent speakers), but they I got bit by the bug. I have a few pairs I really like now, but I have always been curious about the other HD alternatives.\n\nIn my search for that beautiful midrange timber with some more heft in the bass, I got the HD660S2's not long after they were released. They were also really smooth, with great timbre, but even more \"veiled\" and after a year or two, I decided they were not for me, and moved them on. I kept the HD600's, but mostly as a reference, because the bass roll off displeases me. I would never reach for them over, for example, the Edition XS. Totally different sound signature, each with advantages and disadvantages, but overall, that's where that fell out for me.\n\nOn a lark, I just saw the 650's for $300 on Amazon, which is a pretty low price (might still be there if you are reading this soon after it posts - I literally just clicked on them) so I snagged them. I figure I will probably not like them better than the 600 and will send them back, but the curiosity is killing me. A lot of people say they are just a more warmer or even muffled 600, and some say they are an improvement.  I guess I will find out, but I am really curious to hear some fresh opinions from users of both. Which do you prefer and why? Are they both just out of date, with all the great sub $500 offerings out there these days? Not to mention the >$500 offerings.\n\nIn return for your opinions, I will share mine once I get these on my head for a week or so, and get a good solid impression. I am expecting to be underwhelmed. I kinda wonder if I need a tube amp to properly appreciate the HD6XO line. I really like my current dac/amp (dx9), but I could add a modestly priced tube amp to the arsenal.",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m running into a bit of a challenge getting enough power for my main headphones from my Focusrite Scarlett 4th Gen 2i2. The interface itself is great for tracking and monitor control, but the headphone out just doesn’t have the juice I need for the Dan Clark AEON closed X which I love. Need it to record and track etc. \n\nI’ve tried a couple of external DAC/amp setups (one distorted badly from the Scarlett’s line outs, the other colored the sound more than I liked), and I’m now trying to figure out the *right* way to integrate an external amp or DAC/amp combo without messing up my monitor chain. \n\nMy Scarlett’s main outputs are already feeding my studio monitors, so I’m not sure of the best wiring approach. I tried Y splitters so I can keep the monitors as well as TRS to RCA on the zH3 by Fosi, it distorted. On the Schiit Magni it didn’t until higher levels but it did not sound good at all so I returned it. \n\nBasically I’m trying to answer:\n\n* What’s the cleanest way to add a dedicated headphone amp (or DAC/amp) to a Scarlett interface when the main outs are already used for monitors? Should I just upgrade to Topping E2x2 Audio Interface?\n\n* Are there any level-matching or wiring tricks to avoid distortion when feeding an external amp from an interface?\n\n* Would it make more sense to just switch to something like a Topping L50 as just amp (would it make a difference in the wiring) or FiiO k7 (has a DAC though.) I wanted to use the DAC just for pleasure casual listening outside my DAW. \n\nI’d prefer to keep using the Scarlett if possible (and definitely not use ASIO4ALL), but I’m open to what most people do for this type of setup.\n\nAppreciate any advice.

I was specifically listening to my favorite release this year, which is Revengeseekerz by Jane Remover. It is a\npretty loud and sometimes harsh electronic album that I've heard many times at this point through DT 990s but not through this setup.\n\nI noticed what I thought was peaking during some parts, but ultimately began to deduce it to the music just not being very well mixed and mastered for high-end listening application, but I'm still not 100% sure. The music is gritty, dirty, and honestly very fun to listen to. \n\nTruthfully the reason why I mention any of this is because I want to keep my things nice and prevent any wear, in other words, I want to protect my investment the best I can but I'm unsure if music like this (or any music) can really be considered \"unsafe\".\n\nI'll add, I am not listening at high volumes during this album, nor do I have anything EQ'd weirdly, it is essentially just a tube amp, a 6SN7 tube, and the headphones.\n\nIf anybody would want to hear what I'm talking\nabout, some songs I was questioning are all by Jane Remover:\n\nDreamflasher, movies for guys, Experimental Skin, search party.\n\nOnce again, I'm aware these songs are supposed to sound gritty, but there are also some more clear and crisp sections in each of these, so I'm trying to decide if I should embrace the grit and imperfections of these songs through the LCD 2c if it's safe, or continue on my Beyers.",

In the case of the first song, I believe the culprit is the Expanded Edition of the album, but I just can't find the original one in CD quality (digital) for offline use. Both FLAC versions are mixed too loudly (and don't feel as dynamic, though this might be placebo) and have artifacts that aren't (as) present on YouTube, otherwise YouTube is just as crisp and detailed, absolutely nothing is missing, it's just that it's a higher quality master and not that FLAC is more revealing... \n\nI would immensely appreciate help because the 1st song is arguably the most spectacular one I've ever heard on my HD 600, and the 2nd one has really great vocals and layering.\n\nOn a side note, about different file formats and masters:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltjio4AM2uw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltjio4AM2uw)\n\nI thought this sounded great, but the FLAC version actually has noticeably more treble and bass which sound really, really great, not boosted and distorted at all. This is not because of FLAC because if you take that FLAC file, drop it in Audacity and export as a 128 kbps MP3, it's all still there unlike on YouTube, so some masters are really just different and it's not a matter of 128 kbps MP3 being audibly worse than up to 24-bit 192 kHz FLAC, really.

    "selftext": "I had a go at processing the HUTUBS data, which are in ear measurements of the HRTFs and HD 800 S for 96 subjects, and the HD 650 for 64 subjects.\n\nMy intent was to compare the accuracy of the gras and bk5128 rigs to real heads. Each measurement is compensated to the diffuse field curve of the respective head with a -1 dB slope. By compensating to that target we are in effect \"subtracting\" the effect of each individuals ear geometry and are left with only the perceived variation in frequency response between heads caused by the acoustic impedance of the headphone.\n\nHD 800 S:\n\nBoth measurement rigs rise up to 4kHz too quickly and also show the first peak occurring closer to 6k, while real heads show it occuring around 5k. Using a tone generator I can hear it peaking at 5.2khz on my head. The second peak occurs around 7k in HUTUBS. On my head I can hear it around 7.2kHz. Both rigs show it closer to 8 kHz.\n\nUsing this as a basis for EQ results in a much more pleasing sound than the harman target profiles which don't deal with these peaks adequality.\n\nHD 650:\n\nThe HD 650 shows a lot more variance, despite that, there are features in the response that aren't present on either GRAS or BK rig. The first being a peak at 5kHz. Using a tone generator I can hear this very clearly on my head. Then there is a strong recession between 6k and 8k Hz which the gras rig doesn't show clearly.\n\nUsing this as a basis to EQ results in these two headphones sounding the most similar I've ever heard two different models of headphone sound (albeit still different).\n\nI've included headphones.coms processing of the same data for 30 heads, and the results seem similar.\n\nMy take away from this is despite the variance of the results between heads there is a clear average or trend in terms of the most common locations for peaks and dips, and neither of the most common industry standard rigs match it.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe HUTUBS, GRAS and BK5128 measurements all use different units. HD 800 S unit variation is incredibly good so hopefully this isn't an issue. I sourced the GRAS measurements from crinacle and the BK5128 measurements from earphones archive, and overlayed them on top of crinacles measurement.",

    "selftext": "So you decide to upgrade your audio setup with a nice pair of headphones. BuT WhAt PaIr Of HeAdPhOnEs? You ask. Well here it is a guide to headphone tuning.\n\nSo first off there needs to be a disclaimer being no matter what headphones you buy, they will not sound perfect to you. Sonic \"perfection\" is entirely unique to you with complex ideas like HRTF and more importantly how that noggin of yours processes sounds. To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

You hear every detail in perfect harmony. But it’s like eating French fries without a dip. I like eating a few like that, because a few will taste good without a dip. I might, if the French fries are that good, eat the whole thing without dip once or twice. But generally, even if it covers up some of the French fry flavor, I still want a dip like ketchup. Basically, being a little bass heavy or treble heavy gives music a little spice, and it’s definitely better for every day use if you find it to sound better to you. So, I say there’s a limit, but for me. I like a tiny bit of ketchup with my fries thank you very much 😤\n\nPS: my favorite headphones audio wise are the Skullcandy Aviator 900 ANCs.

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. \n\nAfter many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to expand the rapidly growing collection and snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they’d be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. \n\nAfter about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. All the things the 600 family can’t do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. I would even say that I feel let down by the vocal presentation of the HD490 Pro's either, so I think it may just be some rose tinted glasses effect as I haven't owned my 6XX in nearly 4 years. Anyway, I started by just listening to the suede pads for the first 3-4 hours, and have now been listening to the other set. Both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. \n\nThe suede pads are definitely warmer and more relaxed, however after listening to both and EQ'ing with both, I find myself preferring the others. I don't know which are the mixing and which is the mastering set. The reason I am finding myself prefering these pads, I think, is because of the perceived extra detail from the mids and highs along with a more airy and open sense or a stage. I do understand why Sennheiser didn't have these in the 600 family, but I understand why so many have compared them, and I think there are some similarities.\n\nThe drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family (at least visually from the outside) but they provide a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the largest soundstage I’ve heard from a Sennheiser, it’s not even close. In my opinion they pull this off with a sound signature that is easy to listen to but honest and competent, and definitely a Sennheiser open back. That all being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. \n\nAs someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. \n\nWeirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop… I know what you want me to say, but I don’t hate them. They’re definitely not the headphone I’m going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I’m hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes.\n\nI absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is not floating my boat. I will be buying a new balanced cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro’s are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you’ve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I’d love to hear other’s perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I’ll get.",

A retro-style lightweight Bluetooth openback headphones from Philips to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\n\nIn this product category, the closest competitor I could think of is Koss porta pro, Kph30i or the wireless koss porta pro all of which cost more than this product. I’ve also compared it to some grados and my HD6XX and HD560s.\n\nGiven the price range, I was shocked at the tonal balance and the resolution. I would say Grado and Koss both have a very distinct texture of sound that makes it sound really cheap with little bass. In my ears, Ringo definitely has a more balanced V shape sound signature and has less of that cheap texture to the sound. Given my experience and preference, I would take this over Grado SR60/80i/e or Koss porta pro/kph30 any day for its timbre and tuning even if it was the same price point.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the resolution or timbre isn’t gonna beat an HD6XX, and the build is quite cheap. But I find the build with its metal headband more sturdy than any of the Koss headphones that can even be triple the price. For a fun sounding Bluetooth headphones with 26 hour battery, lightweight and decent retro design AND built in app eq for around £20 is crazy. \n\nI’ve got too many headphones and have bought all the headphones mentioned in this review, but I will be keeping these around which is the biggest compliment I can give as I have given away/sold the all the Koss products. I’m no expert and have no intention to try over selling these but for anyone who’s considering a sub 100 open back Bluetooth headphones, these are the best in my experience!",

This is erratic and random sometimes it doesn't! This tinnitus type noise goes away after a few seconds! And comes back when music is paused and it's a repeat cycle!(And no this isn't ANC noise coz it happens when even ANC IS OFF and only happens on the left ear driver/ hardware). And for this price i except a premium consistent experience, NOT this!\n\nAnd secondly, also only the left side earpad makes a mild squeaky toy noise when pressed, but right earpad is dead SILENT even when it's pressed. Is this is how it is suppose to be? Also ironically when earpads were interchanged, SURPRISE surprise! STILL only left side earpads makes this mild squeaky noise when pressed and whilst trying to wear it! (Despite the same earpad when on the right driver is dead SILENT and left earpads is silent on right?!)\n\nAnd thirdly!, the return policy is NON-EXISTENT! In my country!  And when asked about it throught their painfully call with executive they said RESET IT which I had already done MULTIPLE TIMES and tried MULTIPLE DEVICES from latest Android, IPAD AND MacBook Pro. Still it's persistent (random and occasional mild white noise/ mechanical noise from left ear driver alone)\n\nThey gave me an ultimatum to even get it checked I HAVE TO Ship my brand new expensive headphone AT MY OWN EXPENSE AND OWN RISK To their warehouse ACROSS THE COUNTRY! And after sonova took over all the service center were closed except one with courier-in type service center!\n\nMany told that the white noise/ TINNITUS issue SPECIFICALLY Left driver one is kinda common. Can you guys as confirm this for me and also other FUTURE BUYERS. Can you check and test in SILENT room with pausing after playing music.\n\nLastly, is this the QUALITY CONTROL by a 'TRUSTED' german brand? And hassle is almost unbearable and everytime I PAUSE I get left ear driver making a very mild tinnitus sound randomly! \n\nu/sennheiserconsumer\n",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I don't talk on here very often but I had been searching for headphones after my last pair which lasted me about 13 years (Sennheiser HD598's) and still worked fine.\n\nI settled on the Aune AR5000's because they fit my pricepoint. I got them, EQ'd them and fell in love with that nice creamy bass.\n\nThat was exactly 14 months ago. For my usage I babied them, was always gentle despite the feeling of sturdy construction, and adored them. Never dropped.\n\nI have a small'ish to medium head. When I would use my pc I would simply pick them up and put them on like any other headphone.\n\nToday I wake up and the absolute weirdest thing happen, I went to put them on but they weren't... feeling right, I checked and YEP, they had cracked from soft usage after a year. I had seen other users with the pin for the ear support coming out because it was plastic but thought it would never happen to me because I'm so gentle with them.\n\nI have emailed my retailer and aune to see what they say but I'm pretty sure I'm SOL.\n\nMy advice? DO NOT BUY. This isn't a quality control problem, its a design and fundamental flaw in having that section made from plastic.\n\nI'm livid and now have to go searching for new headphones AGAIN.\n\n\n\nEDIT: If aune refuse to help I will investigate the replacement bands, or just outright upgrade to a pair of Meze 105's\n\nThese headphones were great for gaming and music and I feel the 105's have a better looking construction.\n\nAlso after plugging my over decade old HD598's they sound almost as good as the Aune AR5000's. So I think my over-enthusiasm for their sound might have been for reasons I can't explain. These are 90% the headphone sound of them and considering the age of them, that's hilarious.",

    "title": "Arya Organic…Wow",
    "selftext": "My thoughts on the Arya Organics (I know there’s plenty of reviews etc, but what harm can another do)\n\nI jumped into this hobby about 2 years ago roughly. Through that time, I’ve been through plenty headphones, but the only ones I spent a LOT of time with was 2. The Arya Stealth, and the HD560s. \n\n(Skip further down if you don’t care about the previous stories)\n\nThe Stealths were mind blowing to me, I did have planars before these. The edition xs (felt way too cheap for the 300 mark at the time. The Ananda Nanos (clamped like a vice). So picked up the Arya Stealths for £710, which was their cheapest price at the time. I owned these for 6 months. Every time I put them on, I was astounded at the sound. However, after 2 months, I rarely used them, I didn’t have the time to listen, and didn’t want £700 lying around. So I reluctantly sold them, and decided to pick up the cheaper pair, the HD560s. So I could still enjoy music, without feeling guilty having some premium set collecting dust. And these were fine, for £90, they were great.\n\nRecently however I’m now in a position where I have a lot more free time, and for that reason, I wanted to pick up a higher end headphone again. I was debating between many, but in the end it kept boiling down to the Stealths, which were now £460. But then saw the Organics were just £120 extra as “open-box” from Hifiman. One thing I absolutely hated with the Stealths was how harsh some of the treble was, and at the time I didn’t have EQ. So I was stuck with harsh treble in a few songs I enjoyed other times. Between owning the 560s and Stealths, I did pick up the JDS Element 4 Dac/Amp in preparation for higher end cans in the future, and to play around with EQ. So hearing the Organics had a harsh treble, it didn’t really deter me as I had the capabilities to town it down.\n\nSo now onto the Organics…\n\nLOOKS:\nThese things are absolutely gorgeous! It’s like taking your grandads beautifully varnished wooden table and chairs, and adding a modern touch to it. It makes them stand out and look far more premium than the price suggests (I’m aware they were 1500 odd on release, but on current pricing, the point stands). They feel more premium for this matter. I the one massive negative, is you have to wear them to listen, meaning I can’t just stare at them when in use. \n\nCOMFORT:\nAnyone who’s familiar with the Arya lineup, know that this line of headphones are on the comfier side of the Hifiman brand. They clamp just enough to not feel loose, but not too hard that it feels like the hulk is crushing your skull (Nanos). Yes the pads aren’t the most comfy pads on any headphone, they’re actually the one aspect I don’t like. They don’t feel premium, and the fabric design sometimes catches the odd strand of hair which isn’t pleasant. However changing these means altering the sound, which you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT, want to do. The headband is perfect though. Suspended straps are my favourite on headphones, adds a premium feel, look and feels like far less pressure on your head. Not to mention how wide they are, it helps distribute the weight so well.\n\nUNBOXING: \nDead, £5 unboxing experience, but realistically who cares…\n\nSOUND:\nGrand. Exciting. Smooth. \n\nThe 3 words I’d use to describe the sound. Which goes to show how versatile they are. They give off such a ‘grand’ feeling, when you listen to orchestral pieces, it feels like you’re in a theatre listening to a band playing, but like you’re middle row. Not first row where it feels in your face, and not back row that it feels like it’s far away. It’s that perfect middle ground where it’s around you, but so that you can hear everything so cleanly. They’re exciting in the sense that after an orchestral piece, you put on an EDM track, pop or anything in that region, and it feels like you want to get up and just dance, but don’t, as these probably would fall off your head. And then you go for a very vocal focused piece of music, and the smoothness of the voice just glides through your ears. There’s no moment where it’s aggressive (unless it needs to be) or where it holds back. It’s like an electric supercar. You put your foot down, and it picks up straight away, but with no aggression, just picks up and gets going right away. \n\nOnto the specifics:\n\nBASS - Very solid. Definitely stronger than the Arya Stealths. When I had them, the bass was there, but it needed a tad more punch. These add that very subtle punch, where you know it’s bass, but it doesn’t slip into the other frequencies and overthrow them. It’s controlled VERY well. The sub bass is fantastic too. My favourite song to test this is “The Droid Invasion and the Appearance of Darth Maul” from The Phantom Menace. The drums at the start provide that sub bass test and it really shows how it handles it well. Doesn’t get fatiguing, just presents it so smoothly. Not to mention how clear the drums sound, like you can visualise the fabric drum stick hitting against the massive drum. The bass is also quick when needing to be. In many pop songs where there is the common use of bass, or in rap music, it’ll show the bass, and stop it perfectly. It never feels like it over presents itself. They also hold the bass off so well from overpowering the mids. Many headphones either make the bass so minimal that you don’t realise there should be bass, and many push it so hard it dims down the vocals. These control it so so well.\n\nMIDS - I would say the weakest out of the Low, Mid and High ends. Definitely NOT bad, it’s really really great. However when there is consistent bass present, and a lot of higher end or many many instruments playing, the vocals definitely take a seat back. They’re still very clear, but it pushes the instruments forward a bit more. Which isn’t bad at all, and some people may prefer this. It’s more of a preference thing. I certainly don’t mind it, and it’s not something I’m gonna be quickly to go and EQ, but if I was, it’s the first thing I’d play with, just to bring them forward a touch. BUT, when there’s only a low end and vocals, or high end and vocals, they are stunning. They just sound so real and ‘organic’, it’s like having a conversation with David Attenborough, just so nicely spoken and a voice you wish could commentate on your whole life. \n\nHIGHS - Lies were told here, or obviously it’s just down to personal hearing. But these are NOT ‘peaky’ or ‘harsh’. The high end is so well controlled. With the Arya Stealth, I absolutely could not listen to Nightcall - Kavinsky from Drive. The chorus of the song was so harsh I literally couldn’t listen to it. So the first song I wanted to try was that, and on these I could listen to the entire song with no issues. They have just enough brightness to make everything sound clean and clear, but not too much that it comes across as piercing during songs. Same with Time - Pink Floyd. The start with all the clocks can be very piercing with poorly controlled highs, but it’s like the headphones actively know it’s going to sound harsh and presents them just a tone down so that you don’t have to turn the volume down or skip forward. It was my one worry with these, and although EQ is an option, I did want to enjoy them stock for as long as possible. Which I’m ecstatic with the fact I can.\n\nSOUNDSTAGE - Wide, but not artificially wide, just naturally wide. Like I said with the orchestral hall and being “grand”. It just sounds so perfectly deep. It’s not like the sound is coming from across the room, but it’s not like the song is being played right next to you. It’s similar to car speakers, in the way it’s all round you, but not as if you’re listening to the persons car next to you. It’s intimate enough that you feel like it’s YOUR music, not someone else’s near you, but also distant enough that it’s like it’s your own personal concert. \n\nSEPARATION - Always tough because if a song is produced badly, even the greatest ever headphones won’t be able to separate the parts. But in a well produced track, you can actively hear each and every instrument and voice. In “Call it what you want” by Taylor Swift, there’s many instances where there are backing vocals playing over Taylor, and you can hear each one clearly, but as if they’re actually behind her. Like Taylor’s singing into your ear, whilst the backing singer is sat 2 foot behind her also singing, but you can clearly tell one is the main, one is the backing. The 560s definitely struggled with this, you often couldn’t hear the multiple voices, so now listening to many songs, I’m hearing voices I didn’t realise were there (I actually checked on 2 occasions that I wasn’t listening to a remix).\n\nConclusion:\nYes. Just yes. Stellar\n\nSetup I’m using:\nHifiman Arya Organic -> JDS Element 4 -> MacBook M3 -> Audirvana (because Tidal is buggy as anything on Mac since iOS 26 and Apple Music doesn’t auto change the Sample Rate) \n",

I bought these myself as it seemed like a pretty good deal at around $200 with discount codes.\n\nThe Ananda Stealth has a slightly warm tonality. It’s very non-fatiguing and quite balanced. Details are apparent and clearly heard in the background, it doesn’t try to push it up right in your face. Soundstage is okay, not super wide but imaging is good.\n\nFor $200, I think the Ananda Stealths are one of the best valued open headphones. I don’t think I heard anything that sounds as all rounded for $200. I think they’re great for someone who prioritizes sound quality. In terms of build and comfort, it’s just okay, afterall that’s not Hifiman’s strength.",

    "title": "Flux FA-10: Brutal Power, \"Nervous\" Character",
    "selftext": "​I was looking for a powerful and clean-sounding Solid State (SS) amplifier for my HE6se V2 headphones when I stumbled upon this Flux FA-10 on sale for €350 shipped. So, I pulled the trigger. Now I'm here with this Class A \"beast,\" capable of delivering a staggering 16W into 32 ohms (10.5W into 64 ohms).\n​Overall, the sound was... adequate. But let me unpack this a little bit further.\n\n\n**​An Aggressive Presentation**\n\n​I don't want to complain about the cleanliness and detail this unit brings to the table on some (though not all) of my headphones, but I genuinely dislike its aggressive and 'in your face' presentation. \nIt sounds tense, like a nervous person trying to tell a fairy tale to a child. Granted, I'm coming from tube amps like my Eufonika OTL, or the relaxed sound of the Mojo 2, but... I wasn't expecting this kind of house sound from Flux.\nI usually associate Class A with a slightly warm character and a rolled-off treble, which this device is definitively not.\n\n\n**​Lack of Dynamics on Elex and HE6**\n\n​The HE6 and the Elex are among the most punchy and dynamic headphones on the market. The Elex can sound punchy even if connected to a [potato](https://www.instructables.com/Potato-Battery-Understanding-Chemical-and-Electric/), and the HE6 demands significant power to fully express its dynamic nature.\nNevertheless, with the FA-10, both headphones sound unimpressive dynamically, especially the Elex, which really surprised me.\nI usually plug them into an Aliexpress dongle or the Chord Mojo 2 and am always satisfied with the bass impact.\n​The Elex's punchiness seems irrecoverable even with EQ, which only introduces mud into the sound. The HE6, however, can regain some of its impact through equalization.\n\n\n***​Note***: It is important not to confuse the role of EQ. It can add bass quantity, but the violence of the attack of a bass note is what dictates its physical impact. This is a physical characteristic that does not solely relate to the Frequency Response (FR). For example, the FiiO FT1 has much more bass than the Elex, but it sounds way less punchy.\n\n​The Elex sounds somewhat muddy and poorly controlled compared to the Mojo 2, while the HE6 sounds largely as its graph suggests.\n\n\n**Decent ​Synergy with the HD660S2**\n\n​The Sennheiser HD660S2 has a very relaxed sound signature (with some sparkle around 6-8kHz). They actually sound good with this amp because it balances their chill presentation, occasionally making them sound aggressive too.\n\n\n**​Strengths Worth Highlighting**\n\n​Despite my criticisms, I want to highlight the amp's strengths:\n- ​Incredible Power: It runs my HE6se V2 on low gain, using only 3/4 of the volume knob.\n- ​Pristine Cleanliness and Detail: The sound is dead clean and highly detailed.\n- ​Stage and Separation: The stage is a decent, medium size, and the imaging and instrumental separation are top-notch for the price.\n- Flexible Inputs: It accepts balanced inputs, but since it's a pure single-ended device, both the SE and balanced outputs should sound virtually the same. This is a great feature, making the FA-10 more flexible regarding the source you feed it.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n​Ultimately, I would never recommend this amp to people sensitive to the 3-4kHz region like myself. This amplifier is a cannon for those frequencies (from a presentation standpoint). If you have a warm and relaxed headphone, it can truly wake it up. But for neutral to bright headphones, especially aggressive ones like the HE6 and Elex... proceed at your own risk!\n",

    "title": "A New Study on the Equivalence of Harman OE Target on Modern Test Fixtures, Co-authored by Sean Olive and Dan Clark Audio",
    "selftext": "> Summarized by Qwen.\n\nFor years, the *Harman target*—a frequency response profile derived from extensive double-blind listening tests—has served as a benchmark for “neutral” or preferred headphone sound. Originally defined using a specific GRAS 45CA test fixture equipped with a custom “Welti” pinna and an RA045 (Type 3.3) ear simulator, this target has become widely referenced in both research and product development.\n\nHowever, a critical issue has emerged: many modern labs and manufacturers now use newer test fixtures—such as the **GRAS 45CA-10** (with KB5000 anthropomorphic pinna and RA0402 ear simulator) and the **Brüel & Kjær Type 5128** (featuring a Type 4.3 ear simulator compliant with ITU-T P.57). These fixtures differ acoustically from the original Harman setup, particularly in their **acoustic transfer impedance**, especially below 500 Hz and above 3 kHz. Applying the original Harman target directly to measurements from these newer systems can lead to misinterpretation—and potentially misguided tuning decisions.\n\nIn a new paper presented at the **AES 159th Convention** (October 2025), **Sean Olive** (the architect of the Harman target) and **Dan Clark** address this problem head-on. Their work defines *Harman-equivalent targets* specifically calibrated for the GRAS 45CA-10 and B&K 5128 fixtures, ensuring that headphones tuned to these revised targets will sound subjectively similar to those tuned to the original Harman reference.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe authors measured seven diverse headphones including open-back and closed-back models from Dan Clark Audio, HiFiMan, and Sennheiser—on all three fixtures (original Welti, GRAS 45CA-10, and B&K 5128). Using a straightforward calibration method in Room EQ Wizard (REW), they derived fixture-specific targets by:\n\n1. Measuring each headphone on both the original and new fixtures.\n2. Computing the ratio between responses (e.g., KB5000 / Welti).\n3. Applying this ratio to the original Harman target (phase-conjugated and smoothed) to generate a new, equivalent target.\n\nThis process accounts for the unique acoustic loading and leakage characteristics of each fixture.\n\n## Listening Tests Confirm Validity\n\nTo validate the approach, the team conducted controlled **MUSHRA-style listening tests** with 13 experienced listeners, comparing seven versions of the target:\n\n- The original Harman target (Reference)\n- Fixture-specific targets calibrated per headphone\n- Targets averaged across 7 or 20 headphones\n\nResults were clear: when headphones were equalized to their **fixture-specific, individually calibrated targets**, they sounded **nearly identical** to the original Harman reference. In statistical terms, the **B&K 5128** and **GRAS 45CA-10** targets (calibrated per model) were **not significantly different** from the reference in perceived similarity.\n\nBy contrast, targets derived from **averages across multiple headphones** (e.g., “5128_20”) scored lower—though still within the “very similar” range—highlighting that **individual calibration yields the best match**.\n\nInterestingly, the type of headphone (open vs. closed-back) had minimal impact on results, suggesting the method is robust across designs.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nFor engineers and audiophiles alike, this work resolves a long-standing ambiguity: **you cannot directly apply the classic Harman target to measurements taken on modern fixtures** and expect accurate tuning. Instead, fixture-specific equivalents are needed.\n\nEncouragingly, the differences between targets are often correctable with **simple bass and treble shelving filters**, as most deviations occur in well-defined frequency regions. This opens the door for more consistent, cross-platform headphone evaluation—and more reliable interpretations of published measurements.\n\nWhile the study focused on seven models, the calibration framework is generalizable. Future work may yield standardized correction targets for common fixtures, enabling broader adoption without per-headphone measurement.\n\n## Reference\n\nOlive, S., & Clark, D.

    "title": "Audeze LCD5 with EQ is .... WOW (what took me so long)",
    "selftext": "So Ive had a couple of superb  headphones, of which my favorites have been the U12T Iem, Utopia 2022, KSE1200, yet none touch the speaker setup, but thats more to do with physicality.  Anyways, I always loved the technicality of the LCD5 for mixing but hated its tonality for music enjoyment, as its not enjoyable relative to the Utopia, or even the U12t.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xict0bc0iyf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd00e3b32336bb99067869b285106ebc701b94c9\n\nAnyways having recently gotten the U12Ts I was very impressed, as they are pretty damn technical, yet also enjoyable for music enjoyment, and dont require EQ or anything.   I used to EQ the KSE1200 for example which I still think performs technically better than anything else I have, but its a pain....  So that comparison is what got me curious about WHAT IF I spend some time to EQ the LCD5 with a phase linear plugin.\n\nANYWAYS, this is what this post is about:\n\nThe U12T got me curious about adding EQ to the LCD5, and then I saw other people often complain about the LCD5 until they EQ it.  I used the Utopia 2022, as a reference for a tuning I enjoy.  I found in mac the app soundSource allows me to use some of the same software I use for mixing and mastering, to EQ these things.   After EQing it, it punches like the Utopia, but the resolution is still that of the most detailed headphone I have ever heard. Im gonna get hate for this, but even the Stax SR009 doesnt do bass like the LCD5 (or at least I imagine as I dont have them side by side, but I remember it doesnt do bass like the Utopia in terms of weight). With EQ the LCD5 is just WOW.   Now the downside however is this is a pain in the ass to have to setup.\n\nThe setup:\n\n•⁠  ⁠I  found a software in the MAC called soundsource that allows applying corrective curves and also some of the same plugins used for mastering.\n\n•⁠  ⁠On the above software Audeze LCD-5 was setup to Oratory reference.  This corrects some imbalances but also sounds a bit dull next to the Utopia when set to the same curve for example.\n\n•⁠  ⁠To correct that, I then follow this by adding a hi pass WAY below the hearing range at 16hz to help the driver work better not dealing with stuff I cannot hear anyways.   Then I re-add some of the frequencies in the 2.6k nd 5.1k (only about 2-3db), which are frequencies dulled by the oratory curve, in this headphone. This brings a bit of that character I like in vocals in the Utopia, but smooth like the LCD5's are good at.\n\nThe LCD5 can take HUGE gain vai EQ without distorting. Its honestly really impressive.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02k9l6yk0iyf1.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=92b89d90635e2e02a6427c642433eeac833cb9b7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8f6te6yk0iyf1.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=009b587ecf81fffbbfaf2f95aa2aa5bdae0c7732",

    "selftext": "I know this has been beat to death multiple times with multiple sticks, but I was scrapin' the web and didn't end up satisfied - was looking for some more opinions. \n\nI have owned my HD600's for awhile now - a few years probably, and they were one of my first non-completely-crap headphones after using some ear splitty Sony's and BD's. I originally got them for mixing, as I was not really into audiophile listening with headphones (had decent speakers), but they I got bit by the bug. I have a few pairs I really like now, but I have always been curious about the other HD alternatives.\n\nIn my search for that beautiful midrange timber with some more heft in the bass, I got the HD660S2's not long after they were released. They were also really smooth, with great timbre, but even more \"veiled\" and after a year or two, I decided they were not for me, and moved them on. I kept the HD600's, but mostly as a reference, because the bass roll off displeases me. I would never reach for them over, for example, the Edition XS. Totally different sound signature, each with advantages and disadvantages, but overall, that's where that fell out for me.\n\nOn a lark, I just saw the 650's for $300 on Amazon, which is a pretty low price (might still be there if you are reading this soon after it posts - I literally just clicked on them) so I snagged them. I figure I will probably not like them better than the 600 and will send them back, but the curiosity is killing me. A lot of people say they are just a more warmer or even muffled 600, and some say they are an improvement.  I guess I will find out, but I am really curious to hear some fresh opinions from users of both. Which do you prefer and why? Are they both just out of date, with all the great sub $500 offerings out there these days? Not to mention the >$500 offerings.\n\nIn return for your opinions, I will share mine once I get these on my head for a week or so, and get a good solid impression. I am expecting to be underwhelmed. I kinda wonder if I need a tube amp to properly appreciate the HD6XO line. I really like my current dac/amp (dx9), but I could add a modestly priced tube amp to the arsenal.",

The interface itself is great for tracking and monitor control, but the headphone out just doesn’t have the juice I need for the Dan Clark AEON closed X which I love. Need it to record and track etc. \n\nI’ve tried a couple of external DAC/amp setups (one distorted badly from the Scarlett’s line outs, the other colored the sound more than I liked), and I’m now trying to figure out the *right* way to integrate an external amp or DAC/amp combo without messing up my monitor chain. \n\nMy Scarlett’s main outputs are already feeding my studio monitors, so I’m not sure of the best wiring approach. I tried Y splitters so I can keep the monitors as well as TRS to RCA on the zH3 by Fosi, it distorted. On the Schiit Magni it didn’t until higher levels but it did not sound good at all so I returned it. \n\nBasically I’m trying to answer:\n\n* What’s the cleanest way to add a dedicated headphone amp (or DAC/amp) to a Scarlett interface when the main outs are already used for monitors? Should I just upgrade to Topping E2x2 Audio Interface?\n\n* Are there any level-matching or wiring tricks to avoid distortion when feeding an external amp from an interface?\n\n* Would it make more sense to just switch to something like a Topping L50 as just amp (would it make a difference in the wiring) or FiiO k7 (has a DAC though.) I wanted to use the DAC just for pleasure casual listening outside my DAW. \n\nI’d prefer to keep using the Scarlett if possible (and definitely not use ASIO4ALL), but I’m open to what most people do for this type of setup.\n\nAppreciate any advice.

The music is gritty, dirty, and honestly very fun to listen to. \n\nTruthfully the reason why I mention any of this is because I want to keep my things nice and prevent any wear, in other words, I want to protect my investment the best I can but I'm unsure if music like this (or any music) can really be considered \"unsafe\".\n\nI'll add, I am not listening at high volumes during this album, nor do I have anything EQ'd weirdly, it is essentially just a tube amp, a 6SN7 tube, and the headphones.\n\nIf anybody would want to hear what I'm talking\nabout, some songs I was questioning are all by Jane Remover:\n\nDreamflasher, movies for guys, Experimental Skin, search party.\n\nOnce again, I'm aware these songs are supposed to sound gritty, but there are also some more clear and crisp sections in each of these, so I'm trying to decide if I should embrace the grit and imperfections of these songs through the LCD 2c if it's safe, or continue on my Beyers.",

    "selftext": "Sorry if this isn't the most appropriate place to ask. Basically:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOiZC020nl0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOiZC020nl0)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sn6Upf43TA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sn6Upf43TA)\n\nThese 2 simply sound better on YouTube than in FLAC from Qobuz, Amazon Music and wherever. In the case of the first song, I believe the culprit is the Expanded Edition of the album, but I just can't find the original one in CD quality (digital) for offline use. Both FLAC versions are mixed too loudly (and don't feel as dynamic, though this might be placebo) and have artifacts that aren't (as) present on YouTube, otherwise YouTube is just as crisp and detailed, absolutely nothing is missing, it's just that it's a higher quality master and not that FLAC is more revealing... \n\nI would immensely appreciate help because the 1st song is arguably the most spectacular one I've ever heard on my HD 600, and the 2nd one has really great vocals and layering.\n\nOn a side note, about different file formats and masters:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltjio4AM2uw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltjio4AM2uw)\n\nI thought this sounded great, but the FLAC version actually has noticeably more treble and bass which sound really, really great, not boosted and distorted at all. This is not because of FLAC because if you take that FLAC file, drop it in Audacity and export as a 128 kbps MP3, it's all still there unlike on YouTube, so some masters are really just different and it's not a matter of 128 kbps MP3 being audibly worse than up to 24-bit 192 kHz FLAC, really. I've been testing this extensively side-by-side.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,  \nHere I want to share my experience with my Steam Deck. I've had my Steam Deck for about 2 years now, and it's the LCD version. As the title says, my Steam Deck has a problem with the internal cooling fan that doesn’t run properly. Specifically, the fan only runs at around 400–1000 RPM when the temperature is around 40–55°C, but it stays the same even when the temperature reaches 60–70°C. Normally, I’m sure it should be around 2000–3000 RPM.\n\nWhen I'm playing AAA games and the temperature reaches 70–80°C, the fan still stays at the same RPM, so sometimes it gets overheated and causes frame drops. Then suddenly the fan jumps to around 7000 RPM and goes back down again to 400–1000 RPM. Sometimes the fan works normally for a while and run at 3000-4000 RPM.\n\nnormally in the far cry 5 it would be run the fan around 5000-6000 RPM. But it didn’t work, and I’m still getting really bad frame drops to 15 FPS. and suddenly back to normal in second video and the temperature reaching up to around 70-80°C.  \nthe AAA games mostly like this in the first time i run the game, after several times it would be normal and get 60 FPS but sometime back to not normal again, but the worst one is when playing not AAA games, when the temperature is not high.\n\nDoes anyone else have the same problem?, I’ve already tried tweaking the fan settings, but it didn’t fix the issue.  \nI really need help to fix this issue.",

If I could just search for the fuggin' installed folder for the game (in this case Theme Hospital), it wouldn't be so bad. Turns out for Dolphin ,that's a tall order. It has currently been searching teh compdata folder and subfolders for 45 minutes with no joy.\n\nI wondered \"maybe the game didn't actually install\" so I created a new subfolder in a random subfolder and searched for that.\n\nYou guessed it! Another 45 minutes have passed and it still hasn't found this new test folder I made.\n\nSo the Dolphin browser is shit, thus making this an unviable method.\n\nI gigured I'd ask here : is there something I can do? Is there a setting in Dolphin I am missing or just straight up another browser I can download that doesn't suck? Theme Hospital isn't a big game, but it makes my eye twitch thinking there is some storage space gobbled up by the void and there's fuck all I can do, save browse EVERY SINGLE FUCKING SUBFOLDER until I stumble across it.\n\nSorry this is ranting. For me so far, the Steamdeck has been simultaneously the best and worst handheld I have ever owned.

I love this device but my only issue is that it’s so hard to find a good case with the right colour, same with stuff like thumb grips and any other add ons. Thing is with black you can just stick any colour with it but with this white one it’s not as simple. Just wondered if anyone out there could show me what they have done to their white steam deck? \n\n(Also I love the case it came with but it doesn’t fit the deck well once you add a case and other stuff so I probably should get another case too, failing that I’ll just leave it as it is but was just curious.)",

But I heard that you can’t make another region account because it’s based on your address. The game that I’m most excited for to play is persona 5 the Phantom X which is a free Gacha game and of course it’s not available my region, so is there any possible way to play it?\n\nSorry if I kept gambling I just want to make sure because I’m new to the whole steam universe.\n",

    "selftext": "With the default control configuration, when using the trackpad as a mouse I get very smooth movements but if I move my thumb slowly then the movements are extremely slow in game and don't always register. There isn't a smoothing or acceleration setting in the game menus, and playing around with such settings in steam input I've basically got it to where the slower thumb movements convey as much screen movement as faster thumb movements, but they're super jittery. I can't seem to get anything resembling raw mouse input. Anyone know why this is or have any control suggestions for me? Maybe I need to mess around with steam input settings more. Either that or just give up on trying to use the trackpad, because the thumbstick is as smooth as butter, but of course not quite snappy enough for an fps.",

I've just worked out how to create a macro, I'll use the bench reset as an example. \n\nIf you go to your steam controller config for the emulator and bind one of the back buttons to left stick down and then click the small cog and set a secondary command for A (B on steamdeck if you don't have layouts flipped) and then for both of the two commands click the cog again and select setting and turn on the hold to repeat (turbo) and toggle option and turn the repeat rate up to around 250. \n\nYou can now stand in front of the bench, press the back button and it will automatically face you towards the bench and constantly reset and just press again to disable.\n\nHave fun 😊",

    "selftext": "Many steam deck users are going to have an issue where some sounds play out of the left speaker only. Wearing headphones, you'll only hear the gun fire in the left ear, and the ability to use stereo sound to figure out where things are coming from will be impossible.\n\nLooking up ways to fix it, you will no doubt run into the \"use vulkan\" answers. Problem is, the Steam Deck doesn't allow for it to start that way off the rip. So, here's what you do:\n\nIn the game folder, find \"bin\". You'll see a start up for both dx12 and vulkan. You want to COPY that vulkan.exe and paste it in the \"launcher\" folder. When you do, change the name of ZA4 to something else, doesn't matter, but you want to keep it. Then change the Vulkan.exe to ZA4.exe. Bingo bango, audio fixed",

Also, my friend can’t connect to my Parsec host session on Steam Deck – I can connect to his PC just fine, but not the other way around.\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out:\n1) Is it possible to install and run **Parsec Host or Client** on **Linux (Steam OS)** so my friend can connect to me directly from his PC?  \n2) If Parsec doesn’t support this configuration, are there **similar alternatives** (like Moonlight, Steam Remote Play, AnyDesk, etc.) that work well for Steam Deck and allow a friend to join?  \n3) Any specific settings or drivers needed to make this streaming setup stable on Steam Deck hardware?\n\nAlso, if anyone has **any Windows optimization tips or tweaks** that could help make games more stable on Steam Deck, I’d really appreciate it too!\n\nThanks in advance for any help or advice!\n\nPS: Sorry for using \"IA,\" my English isn't good, and also, the Steam link doesn't work well on my phone.

    "title": "Ultrakill Is Not What I Excepted (Written and Video Review)",
    "selftext": "Hello and Welcome Everyone to Another Steam Deck review, todays topic is on Ultrakill a Highly rated and well known indie game that has accrued a vast following over the years for both its extremely fast and difficult gameplay and very intriguing lore. Alongside its many secrets and a very robust speedrunning community.  Over the years the game has seen nothing but improvements and enhancements while still not even being fully complete it stands as possibly one of the greatest indie games ever created not only by a solo dev but across indie game landscape as a whole. At least in some peoples minds. Today well being going over the same 3 things as always in Story, gameplay and performance on steam deck and then giving the game a rating out of 10 at the end so lets begin with Story.\n\nStory: Im not going to go to indepth here on the story as the lore of this game is not only subject to change with updates as the dev has been known to outright change things about the games world and what we are to understand about it but the general premise is of man kinds fall due to the events both leading up to and the conclusion of the \"final war\" which directly leads into our Protagonist and what he needs. V1 is a robot that runs on blood just like his robot brothers and with humans going extinct from what appears to be some sort of unknown global extinction level event robots are having to fight one another due to an ever decreasing amount of blood left on earth. Eventually a portal to hell is stumbled on and the robots begin to invade hell for its blood from the creatures who exist within it. This leading to a major shift in both its eco system and state of. All the while God has seemingly abandoned his post leading to his angels to come home and much disarray occurring from it. The Angel Gabriel having a major role in it. So you as V1 then go down the layers of hell seeking out the blood you need to continue to fuel yourself. There's much more to be said about the story but with it both being incomplete as of this writing and being subject to change were gonna cap it off right there for now. But thus far with my little knowledge and ability to explain the story the games lore as a whole is incredibly intriguing and i think all of you who are interested in it should look more into it. I myself have seen a number of videos breaking down the games lore, bosses and many secrets which all fascinates me, so please do check it out. \n\nPerformance: The game is steam deck Verified and i would 99% agree with that. I did modify some minor settings like turning V sync off and such but nothing major in order to keep the 60fps stable and clean which the game by in large had no problem doing. Im a big fan not only of the graphics but also the art style and the game as a whole ran buttery smooth and really didnt use up to much battery outside of more chaotic and demanding moments which while the game is full of them it usually doesnt hinder the frames or stability to much. That being said when the game does fill up your screen with enemies and explosions and blood and so on i did infact experience lag, heavy frame drop and even split second freezing. I had no crashes and never had to reboot the game due to any of this and i don't remember running into any bugs or glitches that forced me to restart from a checkpoint for any reason. But again the game does at times overwhelm itself with how much it throws at you and how you're able to respond in kind but outside of it being a momentary annoyance it was never actually detrimental to my gameplay at any point, I never died due to any of that happening. So more so a nitpick than anything else.\n\nGameplay: Now ive never been the biggest boomer shooter/ fast paced Fps kinda guy. I've played a few of these kind of games such as Doom 2016, severed steel, dusk, forgive me father, and a few others im forgetting but Ultrakill takes the cake for not only being the fastest bar none, but also being the one that asks the absolute most out of you in quick rapid fire succession. With little to no room for error constantly throwing you into the tightest of spaces and filling them with enemies that are not only highly  aggressive but often have tracking projectiles and its just like dude. You gotta be kidding me. Mind you i played on violent difficulty off rip, and by God i wish i hadn't. I will say the game mechanically both with how your movements work and the alt fires your weapons have go perfectly with one another and the game should be praised for that alone as its all so seamless and creates a flurry of ways to handle enemies and bosses alike that if mastered can make the game your little play thing and have those who oppose you begging for mercy. If you can master those techniques that is. Now this is the part where i say to all of you. You're all wrong and the gameplay is simply just not that good as it is absolute bullshit more often than not and you people who can P rank levels are Fucking insane. There was Mutiple times throughout the entire game where i felt i was just being shoved into a locker and thrown down a fucking hill over and over again with how small the space was vs how many enemies would instantly spawn in, not even taking into account the 2nd wave of enemies that would spawn after a particular enemy was killed. My game would drop frames and even freeze for a second with how many explosions were going off and all the blood filling the screen. If that isnt a sign of the game just absolutely pushing its own limits on how much bullshit it can throw at you at once idk what is. That isn't even mentioning the later stage enemies like those white walker things that crawl on all fours and defy gravity who shoot tracking projectiles at you or the big daddy esc enemies with streams of bullets that move faster than your dashing/ sliding speed or even the over the top bosses that have crazy area damage and are the size of Galactus. How about the fact that your only full auto gun is a nail gun that works on regenerating ammo but its super slow to reload and everything else is single shot pistols shotguns and rocket launchers which btw the rockets literally just bounce off of certain enemies, like they literally just say no and knock them away like a jumbled up piece of paper. The bosses somehow feel easier to take on over some rooms in random levels as its atleast only one target or on the rare occasion, two trying to kill you so you can focus fire on just that atleast but even then your initial encounter with V2 is the ultimate filter in gaming. Its right up there with the original mafia game racing mission. I hate to admit it but i literally had to look up a tutorial of sorts cause i was so lost on how i was expected to kill this guy while only having the nail gun, pistols and a shotgun. Meanwhile he has tracking shots, a super shotgun spread and is zipping around the arena like a mad man. I did eventually beat him of course but it felt more like rolling dice and getting lucky then actually accomplishing something. Your first encounter with Gabrieal feels somewhat similar but his first phase is easy enough then he goes super Saiyan and just pummels you until you can dodge his attacks enough times. No other boss battles even come close to this hard again and these two happen in the earlier chapters in the game. Honestly some of the sub boss encounters feel far more punishing then later bosses like when they throw 4 big daddies at you at once so i ended up just cheesing it by getting on top of a building where i couldnt be hit and sniping them from there because the amount of damage it takes to kill them is insane. The game also has a multitude of what i would call gauntlet rooms full of enemies waiting for you at the final room or right smack down in the middle of a level so i ended up with mostly D or C ratings with the occasional B just like my highschool report card. It would take me like 20-30 restarts and 30-40 mins to beat the average level due to just one specific room filled to the brim with enemies who were all pouncing on top of me before i could even react. While normally i would agree with what i imagine is a great many of you reading this saying that i just need to git gud or saying skill issue. I understand the degree of difficulty is what both makes and breaks this game. For everyone who plays it, its a reoccurring theme in gaming. The barrier of entry so to speak. I respect the developer for doing it as i think to many people play games on easy mode which i find cringe but also making the difficulty not a question of skill but of time. Is where one loses me. A game like cuphead is hard but its fair, there are defined movements and abilities that can be overcome through practice and repetition. That doesnt mean enemies have be stagnant or predictable but when games arbitrarily increase difficulty by just increases enemy stats and lowering yours we all agree that sucks. And when you also inflate it by just filling the screen to brim with enemies, no cover, tracking projectiles, massive area of effect damage, subpar weapons for the job, etc.  I just feel like the game is being hard for the sake of being hard. If i can just bash my head against a wall and will my way to victory i dont think that means the game is hard. At that point the game is simply just insisting upon itself and telling players its their fault they dont find enjoyment in getting their balls crushed at the ball crushing factory.\n\nConclusion: This game receives high praise from every corner of the internet its actually a meme at this point with how many people will recommended this game to the point of exhaustion or how often you'll see it referenced in youtube videos about some the greatest indie games ever or games people always comeback to and so on and while i do think it deserves most of that praise as its atmosphere is simply incredible and the lore of the game is incredibly interesting. The gameplay is so demanding in an ubiquitous and awe-inspiring way that rather than being a good honest fast paced challenge to overcome turns into a slog of a game with a rating system that was pissing me off and while it has great challenges and secrets to find and unlock its continually overshadowed by excessive enemy spawns, over barring attack and movesets alongside with a poor assortment of weapons that felt like pellet guns when being used against anything other than basic enemies. Frankly i find it hard at all to recommend a game like this with how off putting the higher difficulties are while the lower ones felt like a baby mode in compassion because the things that make the game good essentially get thrown out the window leaving no real room for a middle ground which frankly is a disappointment within it of itself. Im gonna give the game a 6/10 while i do plan to comeback for future installments to the story i cant imagine ill be having much more fun then i did before now. So That's gonna do it for today guys i already know many of you are gonna disagree with me so tell why down in comment section down below and i will see you all next time.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,  \nHere I want to share my experience with my Steam Deck. I've had my Steam Deck for about 2 years now, and it's the LCD version. As the title says, my Steam Deck has a problem with the internal cooling fan that doesn’t run properly. Specifically, the fan only runs at around 400–1000 RPM when the temperature is around 40–55°C, but it stays the same even when the temperature reaches 60–70°C. Normally, I’m sure it should be around 2000–3000 RPM.\n\nWhen I'm playing AAA games and the temperature reaches 70–80°C, the fan still stays at the same RPM, so sometimes it gets overheated and causes frame drops. Then suddenly the fan jumps to around 7000 RPM and goes back down again to 400–1000 RPM. Sometimes the fan works normally for a while and run at 3000-4000 RPM.\n\nnormally in the far cry 5 it would be run the fan around 5000-6000 RPM. But it didn’t work, and I’m still getting really bad frame drops to 15 FPS. and suddenly back to normal in second video and the temperature reaching up to around 70-80°C.  \nthe AAA games mostly like this in the first time i run the game, after several times it would be normal and get 60 FPS but sometime back to not normal again, but the worst one is when playing not AAA games, when the temperature is not high.\n\nDoes anyone else have the same problem?, I’ve already tried tweaking the fan settings, but it didn’t fix the issue.  \nI really need help to fix this issue.",

I have many tools, 3D printers, etc, and could custom fab something if I find the right bits and pieces.\n\nLooking for suggestions from anyone with a similar situation.

I understand there is Heroic Installer or whatever it's called and I'll give that a go when I next feel like faffing about, but I incorrectly assumed I could just download direct and it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\nAnd to be fair, if the Dolphin browser wasn't complete garbage it probably wouldn't be so bad doing it this way. If I could just search for the fuggin' installed folder for the game (in this case Theme Hospital), it wouldn't be so bad. Turns out for Dolphin ,that's a tall order. It has currently been searching teh compdata folder and subfolders for 45 minutes with no joy.\n\nI wondered \"maybe the game didn't actually install\" so I created a new subfolder in a random subfolder and searched for that.\n\nYou guessed it! Another 45 minutes have passed and it still hasn't found this new test folder I made.\n\nSo the Dolphin browser is shit, thus making this an unviable method.\n\nI gigured I'd ask here : is there something I can do? Is there a setting in Dolphin I am missing or just straight up another browser I can download that doesn't suck? Theme Hospital isn't a big game, but it makes my eye twitch thinking there is some storage space gobbled up by the void and there's fuck all I can do, save browse EVERY SINGLE FUCKING SUBFOLDER until I stumble across it.\n\nSorry this is ranting. For me so far, the Steamdeck has been simultaneously the best and worst handheld I have ever owned. In fact, the fucking thing wouldn't boot up this morning so having spent hours troubleshooting that problem only to run into this problem with Dolphin, I'm on the verge of checking out with this fucking device.",

Not expecting much power from the seat but if I Can even play it for 2-3 hours and then charge while I try get some sleep and then play again when I wake up that would be perfect.\n\n\nAlso is there a website/Reddit page where I can check the expected battery life of the the Steam Deck when playing certain games?\n\nComplete begginer when it comes to handheld PC's so sorry if these seem like stupid questions, posting this across a few difereent Reddit pages for the best reach.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,  \nHere I want to share my experience with my Steam Deck. I've had my Steam Deck for about 2 years now, and it's the LCD version. As the title says, my Steam Deck has a problem with the internal cooling fan that doesn’t run properly. Specifically, the fan only runs at around 400–1000 RPM when the temperature is around 40–55°C, but it stays the same even when the temperature reaches 60–70°C. Normally, I’m sure it should be around 2000–3000 RPM.\n\nWhen I'm playing AAA games and the temperature reaches 70–80°C, the fan still stays at the same RPM, so sometimes it gets overheated and causes frame drops. Then suddenly the fan jumps to around 7000 RPM and goes back down again to 400–1000 RPM. Sometimes the fan works normally for a while and run at 3000-4000 RPM.\n\nnormally in the far cry 5 it would be run the fan around 5000-6000 RPM. But it didn’t work, and I’m still getting really bad frame drops to 15 FPS. and suddenly back to normal in second video and the temperature reaching up to around 70-80°C.  \nthe AAA games mostly like this in the first time i run the game, after several times it would be normal and get 60 FPS but sometime back to not normal again, but the worst one is when playing not AAA games, when the temperature is not high.\n\nDoes anyone else have the same problem?, I’ve already tried tweaking the fan settings, but it didn’t fix the issue.  \nI really need help to fix this issue.",

    "selftext": "Hello. I've run into a scenario that I'm trying to solve, or at least understand if it's unsolvable.\nI'm working on a project at a site with both underfloor heating and radiators. The underfloor heating has zonal control: thermostats in each room, and a wiring center (bus) that controls the pump, boiler, and each individual circuit.\nCurrently, this system works perfectly. The thermostats call for heat, the corresponding thermal actuator opens, and the room heats up. The thermostats are smart, Wi-Fi-enabled, and connect to Tuya. (They are Tervix brand, which is a local brand, but they are essentially Beok thermostats).\nNow, the client wants to install a smart thermostatic radiator valve (TRV) on the radiator in the same room. I'm trying to figure out how convenient this will be, or if it's even worth doing.\nI built a test bench to simulate this system and connected everything to Tuya. The problem is that I can't group the smart TRV and the wall thermostat together. I understand that having to configure both of them separately is very inconvenient and time-consuming. It should be a simple operation—just changing the room's temperature—but having to go into two separate menus to do this is tedious.\nI thought maybe Google Home, through its integration, would solve this problem, but no such luck, or perhaps I just haven't figured it out correctly.\nHas anyone else encountered this issue? How did you solve it?",

    "selftext": "I am going to be replacing an outdoor light with a Reolink camera flood light. On the simplest terms, if I do a direct swap then the camera (and light) will either be on or off depending on tow the current switch is flipped, far from ideal. Removing the switch is an option, there will always be power to the light and camera, but the only flood light control you get is either automatic based on detection, or on/off via an app. \n\nWhat I would like to do is configure some sort of smart switch into this electrical box where the switch is, so that it will always deliver power to the flood light unit, but use a smart action to only turn the light on or off depending on how the switch is flipped.\n\nThe problem is, from what I found, is most smart switches are also made to function as dumb switches so they can be used even if the network goes down. So none of them have a feature setting where you can set the switch to just always deliver power out, but have the on/off function control some unrelated device. \n\nWhat I am almost going to resort to is removing the switch, putting on a blank plate, and sticking a smart button onto the plate. This way the unit always has power but depending on the button push the flood light will turn on or off. Problem is this is not very clean, and these smart buttons are all battery powered so they will die and need new batteries every so often.\n\nDoes there exist some switch for specifically this use case?",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI recently found out about those commercial “security fog” systems shops use — the ones that instantly fill a room with thick but harmless fog so it’s harder for someone to see/grab stuff. The concept is perfect for what I want, but the real units I’ve found are $$$ (I keep seeing $2–3k+), which is way out of my range.\n\nI’m trying to do a budget/DIY version for a small apartment/home setup.\n\n**What I’m trying to do:**\n\n* I already have a SimpliSafe alarm system.\n* SimpliSafe only talks to SimpliSafe gear, so I was thinking of using a side channel (like having it text/call a number I control) and then having a Raspberry Pi / Arduino listen for that and fire a relay.\n* When it fires, I want:\n   1. A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that’s actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won’t wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20–30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** – Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the “safe default” for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** – Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that’s meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** – Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** – if anyone has done the “alarm → webhook/SMS → Pi → relay → device” pattern, I’d love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it’s just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = “leave now.”\n\nIf this isn’t allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

Hey? Ridiculous, right? Luckily my own smart locks were fine, and I haven’t installed any cloud-based camera systems at home yet, so I dodged that one.\n\nMeanwhile, I noticed that my company’s devices (cameras and the smart lock) just… worked.

My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter.

I checked and the Vaillant is 2 wired.\n\nI guess i need to replace both of them with smart thermostat but in other rooms i have radiators where I want to add smart valves.\n\nCan I turn my radiators on and off seperately if the smart thermostat upstairs is for example on 20°c and i want another room 25°c?\n\nCan i just replace the Vaillant downstairs? Remove the one upstairs and just use the smart valves on the radiators, or do i need to replace the one upstairs also?\n\nAny recommendations what and how to do? Any recommendations on products to use?\n\nSorry for the newb questions.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Meaning I can send a signal to _something_ to turn on when music starts playing.\n\nI suspect that something can be some sort of a 220v plug that connects an extension with multiple sockets where all the gear is plugged in. \n\nThat something must have some sort of way to turn on/off programatically and must be overriden physically. For example for streaming I want it to turn on automatically but when I want to spin some vinyl records, I want to turn it on physically. I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home.

I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.\n\nEdit: turning the lights to a set timer as opposed to sunrise/sunset seemed to fix the issue. Had my phone on airplane mode during when the lights were supposed to turn on and they did. ",

    "title": "New lighting setup questions",
    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "title": "Any way to automatically generate an on/off signal without touching wall-switch?",
    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment.

This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "title": "Controlling a Smart Thermostat and a Smart Radiator Valve (TRV) in the Same Room",
    "selftext": "Hello. I've run into a scenario that I'm trying to solve, or at least understand if it's unsolvable.\nI'm working on a project at a site with both underfloor heating and radiators. The underfloor heating has zonal control: thermostats in each room, and a wiring center (bus) that controls the pump, boiler, and each individual circuit.\nCurrently, this system works perfectly. The thermostats call for heat, the corresponding thermal actuator opens, and the room heats up. The thermostats are smart, Wi-Fi-enabled, and connect to Tuya. (They are Tervix brand, which is a local brand, but they are essentially Beok thermostats).\nNow, the client wants to install a smart thermostatic radiator valve (TRV) on the radiator in the same room. I'm trying to figure out how convenient this will be, or if it's even worth doing.\nI built a test bench to simulate this system and connected everything to Tuya. The problem is that I can't group the smart TRV and the wall thermostat together. I understand that having to configure both of them separately is very inconvenient and time-consuming. It should be a simple operation—just changing the room's temperature—but having to go into two separate menus to do this is tedious.\nI thought maybe Google Home, through its integration, would solve this problem, but no such luck, or perhaps I just haven't figured it out correctly.\nHas anyone else encountered this issue? How did you solve it?",

    "selftext": "I am going to be replacing an outdoor light with a Reolink camera flood light. On the simplest terms, if I do a direct swap then the camera (and light) will either be on or off depending on tow the current switch is flipped, far from ideal. Removing the switch is an option, there will always be power to the light and camera, but the only flood light control you get is either automatic based on detection, or on/off via an app. \n\nWhat I would like to do is configure some sort of smart switch into this electrical box where the switch is, so that it will always deliver power to the flood light unit, but use a smart action to only turn the light on or off depending on how the switch is flipped.\n\nThe problem is, from what I found, is most smart switches are also made to function as dumb switches so they can be used even if the network goes down. So none of them have a feature setting where you can set the switch to just always deliver power out, but have the on/off function control some unrelated device. \n\nWhat I am almost going to resort to is removing the switch, putting on a blank plate, and sticking a smart button onto the plate. This way the unit always has power but depending on the button push the flood light will turn on or off. Problem is this is not very clean, and these smart buttons are all battery powered so they will die and need new batteries every so often.\n\nDoes there exist some switch for specifically this use case?",

I know I can get an LED replacement, and probably should, but I was looking for smart color changing ones and haven't had much luck.\n\nIs there any more niche company that makes this I'm unaware of?

Maybe there's some other bulb format I could use?\n\nAny input/advice appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI recently found out about those commercial “security fog” systems shops use — the ones that instantly fill a room with thick but harmless fog so it’s harder for someone to see/grab stuff. The concept is perfect for what I want, but the real units I’ve found are $$$ (I keep seeing $2–3k+), which is way out of my range.\n\nI’m trying to do a budget/DIY version for a small apartment/home setup.\n\n**What I’m trying to do:**\n\n* I already have a SimpliSafe alarm system.\n* SimpliSafe only talks to SimpliSafe gear, so I was thinking of using a side channel (like having it text/call a number I control) and then having a Raspberry Pi / Arduino listen for that and fire a relay.\n* When it fires, I want:\n   1. A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that’s actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won’t wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20–30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** – Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the “safe default” for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** – Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that’s meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** – Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** – if anyone has done the “alarm → webhook/SMS → Pi → relay → device” pattern, I’d love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it’s just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = “leave now.”\n\nIf this isn’t allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I have moved into a house with 12 massive skylights in the kitchen extension which look beautiful and im loathed to cover them at all but as I am so overlooked by the neighbours to the left and also at night, any light from the kitchen travels all through the house, keeping everyone awake. Not to mention the glare from the sun in the summer months. My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter. So just want to make sure im not going to be left with a permanent install i will hate. Please advise.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dik98j6336yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd4bbf8867ff80c1d200863bd763861ea8117c60\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efo49k2636yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d1adf32542880f2121f73e03474a770ecb68305\n\n",

Meaning I can send a signal to _something_ to turn on when music starts playing.\n\nI suspect that something can be some sort of a 220v plug that connects an extension with multiple sockets where all the gear is plugged in. \n\nThat something must have some sort of way to turn on/off programatically and must be overriden physically. For example for streaming I want it to turn on automatically but when I want to spin some vinyl records, I want to turn it on physically. I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home.

How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option.

    "selftext": "Hello. I've run into a scenario that I'm trying to solve, or at least understand if it's unsolvable.\nI'm working on a project at a site with both underfloor heating and radiators. The underfloor heating has zonal control: thermostats in each room, and a wiring center (bus) that controls the pump, boiler, and each individual circuit.\nCurrently, this system works perfectly. The thermostats call for heat, the corresponding thermal actuator opens, and the room heats up. The thermostats are smart, Wi-Fi-enabled, and connect to Tuya. (They are Tervix brand, which is a local brand, but they are essentially Beok thermostats).\nNow, the client wants to install a smart thermostatic radiator valve (TRV) on the radiator in the same room. I'm trying to figure out how convenient this will be, or if it's even worth doing.\nI built a test bench to simulate this system and connected everything to Tuya. The problem is that I can't group the smart TRV and the wall thermostat together. I understand that having to configure both of them separately is very inconvenient and time-consuming. It should be a simple operation—just changing the room's temperature—but having to go into two separate menus to do this is tedious.\nI thought maybe Google Home, through its integration, would solve this problem, but no such luck, or perhaps I just haven't figured it out correctly.\nHas anyone else encountered this issue? How did you solve it?",

    "selftext": "I am going to be replacing an outdoor light with a Reolink camera flood light. On the simplest terms, if I do a direct swap then the camera (and light) will either be on or off depending on tow the current switch is flipped, far from ideal. Removing the switch is an option, there will always be power to the light and camera, but the only flood light control you get is either automatic based on detection, or on/off via an app. \n\nWhat I would like to do is configure some sort of smart switch into this electrical box where the switch is, so that it will always deliver power to the flood light unit, but use a smart action to only turn the light on or off depending on how the switch is flipped.\n\nThe problem is, from what I found, is most smart switches are also made to function as dumb switches so they can be used even if the network goes down. So none of them have a feature setting where you can set the switch to just always deliver power out, but have the on/off function control some unrelated device. \n\nWhat I am almost going to resort to is removing the switch, putting on a blank plate, and sticking a smart button onto the plate. This way the unit always has power but depending on the button push the flood light will turn on or off. Problem is this is not very clean, and these smart buttons are all battery powered so they will die and need new batteries every so often.\n\nDoes there exist some switch for specifically this use case?",

    "selftext": "When I saw the news about the AWS outage, my first thought was: “Uh oh, that’s going to break half the internet again”....\n\nSure enough, our colleague chat group exploded — people started sharing stories of their home security systems collapsing: “My Ring Cam won’t load,” “My Blink camera just shows blank,” “My smart lock app says server error and won’t unlock remotely\"... Hey? Ridiculous, right? Luckily my own smart locks were fine, and I haven’t installed any cloud-based camera systems at home yet, so I dodged that one.\n\nMeanwhile, I noticed that my company’s devices (cameras and the smart lock) just… worked. I didn’t even notice anything was wrong. Unlocking, fingerprint, logs... all handled locally. No cloud delay, no “server error,” nothing. (Not naming brands or models here, don’t want it to sound like an ad.)\n\nIt actually made me realize how invisible reliability feels.... you don’t notice it until everyone else loses it. No strong opinions here, just sharing a small takeaway: local-first might not sound sexy, but when half the web goes dark, it suddenly feels very smart.\n\nAnyone else got hit by the AWS outage?",

    "selftext": "After that conversation with a fellow Redditor about bringnox smart shades, I ended up ordering six units this year. I've even started recommending them to my clients (yes, I do professional home installation). Here's my detailed experience:\n\nThe ordering form is well-organized with clear categories. I didn't trust screen colors for fabric selection at the beginning. Since I wanted to verify both color accuracy and texture, I ordered their fabric sample book before my first purchase. For anyone with similar concerns, the swatches are totally worth the small investment and so cheap.\n\nTheir measurement video guide is fantastic – I followed it precisely. I measured top/middle/bottom of the window frame and used the smallest dimension (to ensure the shade would fit).\nInstallation is DIY-friendly for anyone moderately handy. The process is straightforward, and I just do: mark level screw positions, drill pilot holes, secure two brackets with a screwdriver, and then it can click the shade into place. Maybe some prople is no need to find the professional helps.\n\nConnecting to my Alexa system was painless. Their instructions are wonderfully clear with minimal steps - maybe the most beginner-friendly setup I've seen.",

While there are so many recommendations and good reviews, I’m unable to narrow down exactly which one I want. I don’t want to follow the hype and end up with one that won’t last long, considering their prices 😅.\n\nMy biggest fear is letting him spend so much money on such an uncommon thing, only for it to break down after a few months. So I’m not just looking at the smart features, but also how long-lasting it is, how easy it is to clean (materials), etc.\n\nIf you’ve bought a smart bed before, I’d like help with knowing:\n\n1. What are the best brands (a durable brand)?\n2. What are some of the factors I should look for when buying one, especially features like sensors, voice control, and temperature regulation?\n\nI’m looking for something comfortable, durable, and worth the price.",

Screen seem to make the most sense but I know it’s going to away from the “clean” look of the doors currently as the canister of the screen will be mounted above the doors or to the side.  It is what it is. Open to other suggestions too (hanging outdoor shades off the balcony far edge to block sunlight in the living room, retractable awning for the 2nd floor master bedroom, etc). \n\nWhat have people used and liked? I don’t mind having it installed but am fairly handy so can tackle an intermediate level DIY project. \n1) large opening slide screens? (Looking at wizard, mirage, Apollo)\n2) large opening motorized screens that comes down from the top? (Genius, wizard, I’m sure others)\n\nIt would be nice to use automation (plan on integrating home assistant into the house soon) to open and close the screen… so smart motorized options seem appealing.

I recently started with the Tapo bridge to fold in kasa with the tapo dimmer / button, which doesn't seem to work from the start.

The only way to add a switch is by using IFTTT. How do I do this? I’ve only set IFTTT rules on my phone, but this would be an IFTTT rule between two devices in my flat not using my phone. Can I create an IFTTT rule on my phone (“if left switch is turned on, left socket turns on”, etc) that will then work even when my phone is not involved (ie offline)?",

    "title": "Bluetti is finally getting a official Smart Home Integration!",
    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nIm Erik aka Selfmadestrom from the Bluetti community. Im working since month on the wish that people want to use Bluetti devices in their Smart Homes.\n\nFinally we can entry the last milestone on this journey. Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don’t support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been deep in the smart lock rabbit hole lately and, man… there are way too many options out there. Every brand swears theirs is “THE SMARTEST”... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere’s what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren’t essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it’s like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world’s “smart homes” catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you’re running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit “nerd level 3000”... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like… what’s the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I’m starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone’s found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I’m cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn’t depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

What I am not really clear on is if the hub is all I require to be able to control these blinds and communicate with an app or will I also need to get a whole house hub??\n\nI just built my house so I have added a bunch of different smart tech - locks, heating system, garage doors are Wi-Fi, now blinds and I’ve got some Eufy cameras to install. It’s starting to be a lot of different apps so it might be worth it to get something to tie it all together. If that’s even possible- I’m not sure but I’m willing to bet that someone on here will know!!\n\nTIA!",

I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

I’ve got the basics covered so far: a dishwasher, robot vacuum for cleaning, AC and central ventilation, a smart lock and cameras for security, plus whole-house lighting control and electric curtains.\n\nNow I’m thinking of adding something a bit different next, maybe for the shower room or the room that opens onto the balcony. I’ve been looking at a window cleaning robot that seems great for those big balcony windows. It needs to be placed on the window manually, but once it’s on, it can clean automatically. I guess it might also work for shower glass.\n\nI’m also thinking about trying a sunrise light on the balcony that syncs with my main lighting setup. Has anyone tried either of these? I’m leaning toward winbot for the window cleaning, but I haven’t found a sunrise light that fits into my google home setup yet.\n\nIf you’ve tried any uncommon or creative smart home gadgets, I’d love to hear what worked for you.

I’m not a complete noob as I’m pretty tech savvy, but here, I’m really stumped.\n\n  \nI bought a Tuya keybox (this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref\\_=pe\\_111711481\\_1111265561\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref_=pe_111711481_1111265561_i_fed_asin_title&th=1) ) for a really simple use case : I want to put my keys inside and be able to open it remotely if someone needs them.\n\n  \nI could give them a code that I set beforehand of course, but it might happen that they need to get in when I’m not here and I didn’t plan for them to come.\n\n  \nI naively thought the keybox would connect to wifi, but it’s only bluetooth and so I bought a tuya gateway too, the specific model that was advertised to be compatible with the keybox, this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref\\_=pe\\_109071451\\_1103836691\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref_=pe_109071451_1103836691_i_fed_asin_title)\n\n  \nIt was a NIGHTMARE to set up, because you actually have to NOT follow the instructions on the manual but instead look at the amazon page where it tells you the correct way to connect, but I managed to do it.\n\n  \nNow, I got my Tuya app with my keybox and my gateway. Great. But I still can’t connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I’ve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn’t change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically… but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn’t detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I’m missing ?

The next requirement is that they have programmable sensitivity and trigger time. \n\nThanks!\n\n————-\n\n\nI’m tired of batteries. I cut out one use and have moved to rechargeable, mostly, but at this point I think I’m ready to just go wired where I can. It’s inconvenient to try doing this for door locks or contact sensors so I may as well target motion/presence ones. \n\nThat being said, it’s hard to get a good list of wired sensors with the options I need. I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can’t set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can’t set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I’m not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don’t have info on any wired then I’ll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while. I have plenty lithium rechargeables and nimh. \n\nI do have HA but I kind of want something that works without the extra work. HA is great and all but to get it to work remotely is … no thanks. \n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I have a very simple heater my garage with an old-school thermostat.  I need to integrate this and have a Zooz Zen16 \"dry contact\" Multirelay to use but am unclear on how to actually wire the heater into this.  I have separate power inputs into the unit which is solved but I have 2 wires from the unit which don't make sense to me on how to connect them.  I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?

The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit?

    "selftext": "There must be a way to fix this. I just replaced a years old Nest Hello (wired) doorbell camera with a new Nest wired 3rd Gen doorbell.  The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said “no” and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

    "selftext": "After that conversation with a fellow Redditor about bringnox smart shades, I ended up ordering six units this year. I've even started recommending them to my clients (yes, I do professional home installation). Here's my detailed experience:\n\nThe ordering form is well-organized with clear categories. I didn't trust screen colors for fabric selection at the beginning. Since I wanted to verify both color accuracy and texture, I ordered their fabric sample book before my first purchase. For anyone with similar concerns, the swatches are totally worth the small investment and so cheap.\n\nTheir measurement video guide is fantastic – I followed it precisely. I measured top/middle/bottom of the window frame and used the smallest dimension (to ensure the shade would fit).\nInstallation is DIY-friendly for anyone moderately handy. The process is straightforward, and I just do: mark level screw positions, drill pilot holes, secure two brackets with a screwdriver, and then it can click the shade into place. Maybe some prople is no need to find the professional helps.\n\nConnecting to my Alexa system was painless. Their instructions are wonderfully clear with minimal steps - maybe the most beginner-friendly setup I've seen.",

LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them!

Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don’t support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been deep in the smart lock rabbit hole lately and, man… there are way too many options out there. Every brand swears theirs is “THE SMARTEST”... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere’s what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren’t essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it’s like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world’s “smart homes” catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you’re running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit “nerd level 3000”... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like… what’s the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I’m starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone’s found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I’m cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn’t depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

For some of the stuff is quite easy with zigbee and all this radio protocols. Even Wi-Fi mostly works. However I reached a problem.\n\nI've been doing some research regarding the AC units. Due to no duct installation, using split units is the realistic only option. However after some research most of the existing automations are done through the AC unit cloud platform (and that is what I want to avoid). Has someone faced this same issue?   \n  \nI thought about IR blasters but its not practical to add it to all rooms (I would need to configure it room by room) and the biggest issue is that the IR blaster doesn't get information back from the unit in terms of configured temperature or on/off status.",

I've even started recommending them to my clients (yes, I do professional home installation). Here's my detailed experience:\n\nThe ordering form is well-organized with clear categories. I didn't trust screen colors for fabric selection at the beginning. Since I wanted to verify both color accuracy and texture, I ordered their fabric sample book before my first purchase. For anyone with similar concerns, the swatches are totally worth the small investment and so cheap.\n\nTheir measurement video guide is fantastic – I followed it precisely. I measured top/middle/bottom of the window frame and used the smallest dimension (to ensure the shade would fit).\nInstallation is DIY-friendly for anyone moderately handy. The process is straightforward, and I just do: mark level screw positions, drill pilot holes, secure two brackets with a screwdriver, and then it can click the shade into place. Maybe some prople is no need to find the professional helps.\n\nConnecting to my Alexa system was painless. Their instructions are wonderfully clear with minimal steps - maybe the most beginner-friendly setup I've seen.",

    "title": "Syncing between iOS reminders and google tasks? Syncing between google calendar and IOS calendar?",
    "selftext": "A couple of years ago I was trying to decide whether to start using google calendar or stick to apple calendar. I am quite deep in the apple ecosystem (iPhone, iPad, MacBook) but I also have one foot in the google ecosystem. Eventually I decided to get google calendar because I just didn’t like the layout of apple calendar and just couldn’t get along with it. I love google calendar, it’s very helpful and has organised my life immensely. For example if I get an email on my gmail account about an upcoming zoom meeting then I can just add it to my calendar along with the zoom meeting link with the tap of a finger. But one of my favourite things about google calendar is that it syncs with my apple calendar so really I don’t even feel like it is a choice between them; both calendar apps have their pros and cons but it doesn’t even matter because you can use both together and get the best of both worlds.\n\n(My one irritation is that if I add something to my google calendar, it will automatically add to the apple calendar. However if something is added to my apple calendar, it DOESNT get automatically added to my google calendar. Eg train tickets, hotel stays, flights and such are automatically added to my apple calendar and NOT to my google calendar. I wish I could make the synchronisation work both ways. Does anyone know a fix for this?)\n\nAll of that to say: the synchronicity between google calendar and apple calendar is so helpful to me because I use both ecosystems quite a lot, and I was expecting the same synchronicity between google tasks and apple reminders. However I am frustrated to see that is not the case.\n\nI am new to using apple reminders. I have a lot of things on my plate right now and lots of deadlines coming up so I thought I would try using apple reminders to keep on top of things and I like it so far. My issue with it is that it syncs itself to apple calendar, not my google calendar. So I thought “ok I will start using google tasks instead” except I hate its layout and much prefer reminders. And find the synchronicity between not only tasks and reminders to be lacking, but also between tasks and google calendar!\n\nWhat I am looking for help for: 1. Does anyone know how I can make google tasks sync with google calendar. 2. Can I sync google tasks with apple reminders. 3. Can I sync apple calendar with google calendar in both directions?\n\nTIA.",

I solved this however by assigning the user to group and giving the policies to that group instead of assigning it to the user directly. My main profile is certainly not part of that group.\n\nI then used a 3rd profile I have to try and fix the issue. I checked effective access to my user folder for my user and everything was checked...\n\nAfter some time I tried again to log into my main user and now it now it worked, but it loaded my desktop with only the shortcuts it seems that everyone has access to (still my wallpaper). After getting kinda freaked out and immediately signing out, I tried again and got the message \"preparing Windows\" or something along those lines. I then seemed to be logged in on a temp profile or new profile, but could still manually access my files via file explorer though (so with my access permission?).\n\nI signed out again and remembered one mistake I might have made that week ago that could cause issues. On my separate E:/ drive I had assigned deny permission both at the root of the drive as well as on 2 folders on that drive (nothing really important in those folders). These were essentially redundant permission that I should not be able to even assign if they are already inherited form the root, but since I did these beofre the root E;/ permissions they were still there. (These permission were for that group I talked about in the beginning and my user was certainly not a part of that group, only user 2.) I really doubt that this had anything to do with fixing the issue, but when I restarted my pc and tried once more I could log in to what really seemed to be my full account once again (although my desktop got completely rearranged). Issue fixed, I think?\n\nDo note that this whole time I had no problem to log into either user 2 or 3.\n\nWhat caused the issue and is it even fixed?",

It started happening to another game I played as well (iRacing), where my PC would shut down after about half an hour. This didn't happen if I played games like CS2, or if I was just using the PC normally.\n\nMSi Afterburner didn't show significant temperature spikes while gaming (CPU would be at about 55\\~65C and GPU would be at about 60\\~70C and at about 80% load in BF6), so I don't think the PC is overheating at all.\n\nFrom what I have been reading, such a random shutdown under load indicates a possible problem with the PSU. However, I replaced it in May, and I have had zero problems with the PC at all (even throughout the BF6 beta) until the last week or so.\n\nGiven how new my PSU is and how it coincided with my BF6 playtime, is it possible that the game damaged my PSU somehow? Or am I just looking at the wrong things and maybe something else (hardware or software) might be causing the issue?\n\nHere are my PC specs (bought a 2023 prebuilt secondhand and swapped some parts in):\n\nMotherboard: AsRock H570 Phantom Gaming 4\n\nCPU: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11700 @ 2.50GHz   2.50 GHz\n\nCooler: Scythe Mugen 5 air cooler\n\nRAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3200MHz 32GB (replaced April 2025; was originally Samsung 16GB DDR4)\n\nGPU: Palit GeForce RTX 3070 GamingPro 8GB\n\nSSD: PHISON PS5012-E12S 1T NVMe 1024GB/1TB \n\nPSU: Superflower LEADEX III 80+ GOLD 1000W (replaced May 2025; was originally AcBel P3B 650W)",

Reboot hab ich schon gemacht ohne Erfolg.\n\n\n\nMacht es Sinn, temporär per iSCSI an die V3700 zu gehen (ESXi lokal booten → iSCSI-Target → Datastore wieder da), oder übersehe ich da was?\n\n\n\nIst Lenovo aktuell der richtige Kontakt für dieses alte Storwize? (Gerät stammt noch aus „IBM“-Zeiten.)\n\n\n\nZiel:\n\nIch will eigentlich nur vCenter + Shares so schnell wie möglich wieder online haben – egal ob über SAS oder notfalls „langsam“ über LAN.\n\n\n\nDanke 🙏",

This gives the impression that the driver is not correct. Printing also fails, and the printer shows a red error light.\n\nHowever, if I go to **Control Panel → Devices and Printers → “The printer I want isn’t listed” → Add a printer using IP address**, and then choose to use the current driver (recommended), the printer installs correctly, all features are accessible, and printing works fine.\n\nMy question is: why can’t the printer be installed correctly by name, but works fine when installed via IP address? Is there a way to install the printer by name so that if the IP address changes, we won’t need to reinstall the printer on all computers?\n\nThank you,",

Mostly we are on the pcs and maybe playing something on the tv or one pc and one console going at the sametime. We dont have any problems at all with this plan from comcast but the only problem is the price. It went up from 85 to a 115 and that’s with a paperless and autopay discount. Now AT&T in my area with those discount and paying to cancel my current plan cost $37 dollars a month but the speed is 1gig with fiber optic internet which I know is better than the router WiFi. My question is, is 1gig good enough for how we use the internet or would we run into some problems? ",

We tried his sim card in an iPhone and a Samsung, both working just fine, with the APN settings being automatically set correctly. Any tips? WiFi calling is off, as well as allow 2G, as recommended from his carrier.\n\nI am wondering about a specific setting that they did not specify. Under APN I can check or uncheck a list of carriers (LTE, EDGE, etc) or choose not specified. It seems to make no difference wether all or none are selected.",

The first scenario is if it's turned on and I apply pressure to the lower left half of the display it shuts off. The second scenario is if I turn the phone on while already applying pressure to that same area it works normally until I release the pressure, and it then shuts off. \n\nDue to this, I believe in the first scenario something is not making contact, and once I apply pressure it then does, and it causes the phone to shut off. In the second scenario it must be making contact before the phone is turned on, and once I release it the loss of contact is causing it to shut off.\n\n[Here is a video displaying the issue](https://imgur.com/a/FSuDJt9), does anyone know what could be causing this?

I did decide however a few months ago that it was time to relpace the battery as it wasnt holding charge well anymore, so I did that.\n\nHowever, recently (maybe 4 months after the battery change, and likely unrelated), it seems when I plug in the laptop to charge it doesnt make a solid connection anymore and I have to angle the cable almost upside down at like 12O'Clock just to get a stable contact. Also, when charging there is a slight low-level buzzing which didnt happen before. To me it seems like the contact is weak.\n\nI carefully cleaned the inside of the cable head with isopropal alcohol and some cotton on a toothpick, the same with the socket. And I checked the socket which seems to be aligned correctly, its not loose or anything. I even opened the laptop and can see the socet module is fixed correctly, not loose.\n\nMy only guess is maybe the wire in the cable is deteriorated somehow, like how old AUX cord headphone cables just crap out after a while.\n\nPC Specialist say it will cost 70 euros for a replacement which is actually cheap considering the charging model. Its written \"aicr010230-1906\" if anyone wants to look it up.\n\nBefore I spend 70 euros, I was wondering if theres anything I should check for before deciding its the cable that needs replacing. Any way to tell if the socket is whats causing the issue.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I’m especially on edge since the website was covered in a frankly unnecessary amount of advertisements. Paranoia fuelled rat brain tells me the blue line is a malware warning or something.",

    "selftext": "I ran into a weird issue with my PC after testing some components for a friend.\n\nSo recently, I wanted to test my friend’s SSD, PSU, and GPU to make sure they all work. I plugged the power supply and graphics card into my motherboard, and because my friend’s SSD needed a different driver (my graphics card is an NVIDIA while his is an AMD), I temporarily replaced my main SSD (the one with Windows installed) with his SSD and installed Windows 11 on it.\n\nThe games I wanted to test were on my own main SSD, so I put my SSD into the second slot. \n\nWhen I first plugged my main SSD in as the second drive (for testing), it didn’t show up until I manually assigned it a drive letter, I gave it E: since D: was already used by another SSD.\n\nEverything worked fine during testing. games worked. benchmark ran fine.\n\nBut when I put my components back into their original setup and booted from my main SSD (which I put back in the first slot) again, that’s when things started going wrong:\n\n* On boot, I got a Chromium pop-up saying: *“Profile error occurred. Your preferences cannot be read. Some features may be unavailable and changes to preferences won’t be saved.”*\n* I can’t open any of the installed apps from the Start menu. Programs in Program Files (and Program Files x86) still work if I open them directly from their folders.\n* Apps installed in AppData (like Discord) give this error: *“Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.”*\n* All my browser data is gone, opening Edge looks like a fresh install.\n* My user folders (Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos, etc.) no longer show up in File Explorer’s quick access, though the data is still there under `C:\\Users\\[username]`.\n* The system is really laggy, like drivers aren’t properly loaded.\n* Running `chkdsk` gives: *“Cannot open volume for direct access.”*\n\ncomparing the SID from `whoami /user` and the one in regedit under ProfileList is a match.\n\n**Interesting part:**  \nIf I create a new user profile through `netplwiz`, that profile works fine, all apps and folders behave normally.\n\nSo clearly, something’s broken with my original user profile.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea what could’ve caused this, and how I can fix it without reinstalling Windows or losing my existing profile data?",

Sometimes the \"heating process\" does not stops at 70-80 celsius, it goes above 90 then the notebook turns off. I have tried to find a solution to manually change the fan curve, but in this model this is not available, neither with the Lenovo Vantage software. I have tried to change the energy mods, but it did not help. My last action was the thermal paste change and dust the machine off, but no, it did not help at all. Any idea what can I do with this?

I had hoped for more from the change.\nMy case is small, which means the card lacks some space to breathe. I guess that's the reason, right? I also read that the Gigabyte card isn't that great\n",

One day i heard a loud slam and I came to check it out, there I found him on the home screen - he explained that he “slammed on the keyboard” and the screen “went all weird, like black with some colours in a corner”. He explained how he forced the power off and turned the device back on and all was good. Since then, my laptop has been performing pretty sub-par, at least compared to how it was/ should be. Things like lower frame rates (about 80 fps on games like minecraft, where before i could comfortably run them at a over 100) and on most games the display and audio would constantly stutter, making for an extremely annoying experience. Another thing is that windows seem to not update right, like It’d only update the areas I move my mouse over, though these happenings typically fix themselves or are easily fixed by minimising and reopening the window. Something pretty concerning happened today as well - the right of my screen flashed with blues and pinks for a couple moments before stopping. This laptop was a gift and it’s fairly new, I know these things don’t really have the option for swapping out parts and I’m asking if anyone knows what i could possibly do to fix this?",

Mostly we are on the pcs and maybe playing something on the tv or one pc and one console going at the sametime. We dont have any problems at all with this plan from comcast but the only problem is the price. It went up from 85 to a 115 and that’s with a paperless and autopay discount. Now AT&T in my area with those discount and paying to cancel my current plan cost $37 dollars a month but the speed is 1gig with fiber optic internet which I know is better than the router WiFi. My question is, is 1gig good enough for how we use the internet or would we run into some problems? ",

In the Event Viewer it gives me a DCOM error every time Cyberpunk crashes. I tried most of the solutions I found on the Internet but nothing worked. I thought the rig could be overheating but temps seem okay. However, last night BG3 crashed twice and then I got a blue screen that didn't even fully display before the system restarted. I've been thinking for a while now that it might be related to the power supply. The rig is plugged in a power strip. Aside from crashes, there are no other problems, no lagging or anything.

    "selftext": "Hi, I have been playing BF6 since purchasing it about 2 weeks ago, and recently I have been getting random shutdowns where the PC would randomly black out (like the power tripped), then I hear a click and the PC restarts.\n\nAt first I thought it was simply the game files being corrupt or something so I would just verify the files on Steam, which used to alleviate it until the last season update, where it would crash after playing for about 10 minutes. It started happening to another game I played as well (iRacing), where my PC would shut down after about half an hour. This didn't happen if I played games like CS2, or if I was just using the PC normally.\n\nMSi Afterburner didn't show significant temperature spikes while gaming (CPU would be at about 55\\~65C and GPU would be at about 60\\~70C and at about 80% load in BF6), so I don't think the PC is overheating at all.\n\nFrom what I have been reading, such a random shutdown under load indicates a possible problem with the PSU. However, I replaced it in May, and I have had zero problems with the PC at all (even throughout the BF6 beta) until the last week or so.\n\nGiven how new my PSU is and how it coincided with my BF6 playtime, is it possible that the game damaged my PSU somehow? Or am I just looking at the wrong things and maybe something else (hardware or software) might be causing the issue?\n\nHere are my PC specs (bought a 2023 prebuilt secondhand and swapped some parts in):\n\nMotherboard: AsRock H570 Phantom Gaming 4\n\nCPU: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11700 @ 2.50GHz   2.50 GHz\n\nCooler: Scythe Mugen 5 air cooler\n\nRAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3200MHz 32GB (replaced April 2025; was originally Samsung 16GB DDR4)\n\nGPU: Palit GeForce RTX 3070 GamingPro 8GB\n\nSSD: PHISON PS5012-E12S 1T NVMe 1024GB/1TB \n\nPSU: Superflower LEADEX III 80+ GOLD 1000W (replaced May 2025; was originally AcBel P3B 650W)",

    "selftext": "Hi \n\nWe have a small office network with an Internet service provider–supplied modem/router (all-in-one), a 24-port unmanaged switch, and computers and printers connected to the switch.\n\nWhen I try to install the Ricoh printer by name, I go to **Control Panel → Devices and Printers** and see the printer listed as “IM5000.” When I click on that icon, the printer appears to install, but when I check the printer properties or preferences, not all options are available. This gives the impression that the driver is not correct. Printing also fails, and the printer shows a red error light.\n\nHowever, if I go to **Control Panel → Devices and Printers → “The printer I want isn’t listed” → Add a printer using IP address**, and then choose to use the current driver (recommended), the printer installs correctly, all features are accessible, and printing works fine.\n\nMy question is: why can’t the printer be installed correctly by name, but works fine when installed via IP address? Is there a way to install the printer by name so that if the IP address changes, we won’t need to reinstall the printer on all computers?\n\nThank you,",

I have the problem that my MacBook saves all my files in a folder named *Group Containers*. Because of that, my local storage is full, for example more than 300 GB in System Files on my 500 GB Mac. I adjusted the settings to only save files when needed, but they are still there. The only solution I have found is to delete OneDrive and install it again so that everything is cleaned. But after a couple of weeks, if not days, it takes up all the storage again. Does anyone know what I can do to clear the files without uninstalling and logging in again every time it gets full?",

The first scenario is if it's turned on and I apply pressure to the lower left half of the display it shuts off. The second scenario is if I turn the phone on while already applying pressure to that same area it works normally until I release the pressure, and it then shuts off. \n\nDue to this, I believe in the first scenario something is not making contact, and once I apply pressure it then does, and it causes the phone to shut off. In the second scenario it must be making contact before the phone is turned on, and once I release it the loss of contact is causing it to shut off.\n\n[Here is a video displaying the issue](https://imgur.com/a/FSuDJt9), does anyone know what could be causing this?

    "selftext": "A couple of years ago I was trying to decide whether to start using google calendar or stick to apple calendar. I am quite deep in the apple ecosystem (iPhone, iPad, MacBook) but I also have one foot in the google ecosystem. Eventually I decided to get google calendar because I just didn’t like the layout of apple calendar and just couldn’t get along with it. I love google calendar, it’s very helpful and has organised my life immensely. For example if I get an email on my gmail account about an upcoming zoom meeting then I can just add it to my calendar along with the zoom meeting link with the tap of a finger. But one of my favourite things about google calendar is that it syncs with my apple calendar so really I don’t even feel like it is a choice between them; both calendar apps have their pros and cons but it doesn’t even matter because you can use both together and get the best of both worlds.\n\n(My one irritation is that if I add something to my google calendar, it will automatically add to the apple calendar. However if something is added to my apple calendar, it DOESNT get automatically added to my google calendar. Eg train tickets, hotel stays, flights and such are automatically added to my apple calendar and NOT to my google calendar. I wish I could make the synchronisation work both ways. Does anyone know a fix for this?)\n\nAll of that to say: the synchronicity between google calendar and apple calendar is so helpful to me because I use both ecosystems quite a lot, and I was expecting the same synchronicity between google tasks and apple reminders. However I am frustrated to see that is not the case.\n\nI am new to using apple reminders. I have a lot of things on my plate right now and lots of deadlines coming up so I thought I would try using apple reminders to keep on top of things and I like it so far. My issue with it is that it syncs itself to apple calendar, not my google calendar. So I thought “ok I will start using google tasks instead” except I hate its layout and much prefer reminders. And find the synchronicity between not only tasks and reminders to be lacking, but also between tasks and google calendar!\n\nWhat I am looking for help for: 1. Does anyone know how I can make google tasks sync with google calendar. 2. Can I sync google tasks with apple reminders. 3. Can I sync apple calendar with google calendar in both directions?\n\nTIA.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve got a weird issue with my  Lenovo laptop (Model 82KU, Windows 11 Home Single Language, BIOS GLCN52WW) .\n\nA few days ago I noticed a **pinkish-red small gridded line pattern** appearing near the  bottom of my screen (around the taskbar area) .\nHere’s what I’ve observed so far:\n\n* The lines **don’t appear in screenshots**\n* I haven’t dropped the laptop or damaged the screen physically.\n* I tried restarting  no change.\n* The laptop runs fine otherwise (Lenovo 82KU, AMD CPU, Windows 11 build 22631).\n\n\n\nDoes this sound like a **display cable issue**, **dead pixels**, or an **actual screen panel problem**?\nAlso, has anyone seen this specific “gridded pink/red” effect before on a Lenovo screen?\n\nAny advice or quick diagnostic steps would help. Thanks in advance!",

I solved this however by assigning the user to group and giving the policies to that group instead of assigning it to the user directly. My main profile is certainly not part of that group.\n\nI then used a 3rd profile I have to try and fix the issue. I checked effective access to my user folder for my user and everything was checked...\n\nAfter some time I tried again to log into my main user and now it now it worked, but it loaded my desktop with only the shortcuts it seems that everyone has access to (still my wallpaper). After getting kinda freaked out and immediately signing out, I tried again and got the message \"preparing Windows\" or something along those lines. I then seemed to be logged in on a temp profile or new profile, but could still manually access my files via file explorer though (so with my access permission?).\n\nI signed out again and remembered one mistake I might have made that week ago that could cause issues. On my separate E:/ drive I had assigned deny permission both at the root of the drive as well as on 2 folders on that drive (nothing really important in those folders). These were essentially redundant permission that I should not be able to even assign if they are already inherited form the root, but since I did these beofre the root E;/ permissions they were still there. (These permission were for that group I talked about in the beginning and my user was certainly not a part of that group, only user 2.) I really doubt that this had anything to do with fixing the issue, but when I restarted my pc and tried once more I could log in to what really seemed to be my full account once again (although my desktop got completely rearranged). Issue fixed, I think?\n\nDo note that this whole time I had no problem to log into either user 2 or 3.\n\nWhat caused the issue and is it even fixed?",

The point at which a BSOD occurs is highly inconsistent, so i suspect its just a RAM stick going bad. But i want to make sure.\n\nIn short, i am trying to figure a way to confirm one of the possibilities:\n\nA, if the issue is the RAM stick(s)\n\nB, if its the RAM slots\n\nOr C, a third option that i am ignorant to due to my poor technical literacy.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated, thank yous in advance.",

    "selftext": "Specs:\nIntel core i9\nRTX 4070\nWindows 11\nhas an SSD\n\nI got this laptop about a year back (august 2024), at times I’d let my younger brother play some of his games on there, he rages sometimes but I never really thought much of it. One day i heard a loud slam and I came to check it out, there I found him on the home screen - he explained that he “slammed on the keyboard” and the screen “went all weird, like black with some colours in a corner”. He explained how he forced the power off and turned the device back on and all was good. Since then, my laptop has been performing pretty sub-par, at least compared to how it was/ should be. Things like lower frame rates (about 80 fps on games like minecraft, where before i could comfortably run them at a over 100) and on most games the display and audio would constantly stutter, making for an extremely annoying experience. Another thing is that windows seem to not update right, like It’d only update the areas I move my mouse over, though these happenings typically fix themselves or are easily fixed by minimising and reopening the window. Something pretty concerning happened today as well - the right of my screen flashed with blues and pinks for a couple moments before stopping. This laptop was a gift and it’s fairly new, I know these things don’t really have the option for swapping out parts and I’m asking if anyone knows what i could possibly do to fix this?",

Mostly we are on the pcs and maybe playing something on the tv or one pc and one console going at the sametime. We dont have any problems at all with this plan from comcast but the only problem is the price. It went up from 85 to a 115 and that’s with a paperless and autopay discount. Now AT&T in my area with those discount and paying to cancel my current plan cost $37 dollars a month but the speed is 1gig with fiber optic internet which I know is better than the router WiFi. My question is, is 1gig good enough for how we use the internet or would we run into some problems? ",

It's mainly Cyberpunk is crashing and it's not all the time at that-some days I can game for hours without any problems, other times the crashing is so bad I can't play at all. In the Event Viewer it gives me a DCOM error every time Cyberpunk crashes. I tried most of the solutions I found on the Internet but nothing worked. I thought the rig could be overheating but temps seem okay. However, last night BG3 crashed twice and then I got a blue screen that didn't even fully display before the system restarted. I've been thinking for a while now that it might be related to the power supply. The rig is plugged in a power strip. Aside from crashes, there are no other problems, no lagging or anything. Only after one crash the cursor became somewhat sluggish but there haven't been any other problems. \n\nI ran Windows Memory Diagnostic three times, said everything is fine.

    "selftext": "Hi, I have been playing BF6 since purchasing it about 2 weeks ago, and recently I have been getting random shutdowns where the PC would randomly black out (like the power tripped), then I hear a click and the PC restarts.\n\nAt first I thought it was simply the game files being corrupt or something so I would just verify the files on Steam, which used to alleviate it until the last season update, where it would crash after playing for about 10 minutes. It started happening to another game I played as well (iRacing), where my PC would shut down after about half an hour. This didn't happen if I played games like CS2, or if I was just using the PC normally.\n\nMSi Afterburner didn't show significant temperature spikes while gaming (CPU would be at about 55\\~65C and GPU would be at about 60\\~70C and at about 80% load in BF6), so I don't think the PC is overheating at all.\n\nFrom what I have been reading, such a random shutdown under load indicates a possible problem with the PSU. However, I replaced it in May, and I have had zero problems with the PC at all (even throughout the BF6 beta) until the last week or so.\n\nGiven how new my PSU is and how it coincided with my BF6 playtime, is it possible that the game damaged my PSU somehow? Or am I just looking at the wrong things and maybe something else (hardware or software) might be causing the issue?\n\nHere are my PC specs (bought a 2023 prebuilt secondhand and swapped some parts in):\n\nMotherboard: AsRock H570 Phantom Gaming 4\n\nCPU: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11700 @ 2.50GHz   2.50 GHz\n\nCooler: Scythe Mugen 5 air cooler\n\nRAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3200MHz 32GB (replaced April 2025; was originally Samsung 16GB DDR4)\n\nGPU: Palit GeForce RTX 3070 GamingPro 8GB\n\nSSD: PHISON PS5012-E12S 1T NVMe 1024GB/1TB \n\nPSU: Superflower LEADEX III 80+ GOLD 1000W (replaced May 2025; was originally AcBel P3B 650W)",

I used a few guides and they wanted me to reinstall my wifi drivers. I looked where they said in device manager and I couldn't find any, even with the hidden icons visible. Troubleshooting resulted it in asking me to plug in Ethernet, so that wasn't helpful. Any advice?",

    "selftext": "Today I connected to gym wifi,  because of no internet connection at my gym. I went on vpn simultaneously. Unlocked my android phone 10 minutes after arriving and noticed \"androidsystem safety core\" installed, and it said info or launch. I hit return but it disappeared, found it in apps and immediately removed together with one other app, that installed just now in the same time period when on wifi (I think other app is android system WebView)\n\n  \nSo question: could it be virus infected to my phone through the wifi I connected to (technically it is public wifi, anyone coming to gym knows password) OR is it some Google's shenanigans, thar installed this through wifi? (I did connect to home wifi earlier this year, but normally using mobile data)\n\nIs it safe to use my phone, login to apps etc?",

Couple that with her metal roof on her house, and something weird happens. \n\nI bought my mom a Samsung S22 since her older phone screen is cracked, however.... what happens is when she's in her house, on the new phone, she gets no service, but on her old phone she gets about 2 bars.  If she goes outside, she gets about double that in signal strength and if she goes into the neighboring city both the new and old phone have great coverage. \n\nHow can I boost the cell signal at her house so she has a decent signal?  I worry (she lives alone) that she might not have a signal to call out if there's an emergency.\n",

    "selftext": "Hello, I have a problem with my Pixel 7 Pro that causes it to shut off. The first scenario is if it's turned on and I apply pressure to the lower left half of the display it shuts off. The second scenario is if I turn the phone on while already applying pressure to that same area it works normally until I release the pressure, and it then shuts off. \n\nDue to this, I believe in the first scenario something is not making contact, and once I apply pressure it then does, and it causes the phone to shut off. In the second scenario it must be making contact before the phone is turned on, and once I release it the loss of contact is causing it to shut off.\n\n[Here is a video displaying the issue](https://imgur.com/a/FSuDJt9), does anyone know what could be causing this? Thanks.",

Every once in a while, the audio will get all distorted and crackle. The only way to fix it quick is for me to switch inputs back and forth through the remote and come back. I've tried buying new cables, cleaned the ports, Reset PC, Sound bar, and TV. Tried turning rebar in bios on and off. Changing CPU voltage. Clean install Video card Drivers, Nvidia 3960Ti. Changed audio signal to Auto, PCM, and digital. I feel like I've tried everything. It only happens to the sound bar audio. I changed audio all the way down to CD to Dolby Surround sound and still it crackles every once in a while. Doesn't matter if I play a video or game. It will go away after about 30sec to a min. But the fastest way is for me to change input and back. It's driving me nuts, any help would be great!",

All I was doing was searching up good builds for Mayano top gun in umamusume and then just. Blue line. I’m especially on edge since the website was covered in a frankly unnecessary amount of advertisements. Paranoia fuelled rat brain tells me the blue line is a malware warning or something.",
