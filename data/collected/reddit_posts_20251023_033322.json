First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

No problem. With Press Mode, you can open Dory’s sleek UI using a global shortcut or a **trackpad gesture!** (new)\n\nDory works right out of the box - and over time, it learns which apps you use most and prioritizes them.\n\nNo extra shortcuts.\n\nNo setup.

And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

However, about a month ago the sound for music and everything else Josh plays out of my microphone. It’s incredibly hard to hear anything because of that. I’m really hoping there’s some sort of fix for this. I’ve tried going into audio and visual settings, checking Disable Phone Noise Cancellation, and checked Accessibility Audio Balance. I tried restarting my phone. Nothing seems to be clogging the speakers. None of this worked.\n\nHopefully the next couple of months I’ll be able to trade my phone in and get something newer but I really would love for my phone to be fixed for the time being. I’m almost accustomed to the low sound now. Luckily I connected it to my car speakers when I’m out and that helps.\n\nIf anyone can help me at all, that would be more than greatly appreciated. I want to chuck my phone at a wall, but then I would have no phone and I’m past that lol",

    "selftext": "was hoping someone might have some insight here about this issue that started the day I got my 16 pro max.  for quick context, Warcraft 3 is a game I have been playing on my hotspot at work and in spare time for 20+ years and it’s worked on all my iPhones never an issue . iPhone 3gs, 4s, 5, 6 plus, 7 pro max, 11 pro max , 14 pro max and now has almost completely stopped working on the 16 pro max. \n\n  \nI have done all the things.. wiped the os clean reinstall, no antivirus, disabled all firewalls , reinstalled the games and launchers , new laptop , wiped the phone and tried as a new phone without being backed up , switched to e sim, back to a new SIM card … nothing works. hours on the phone with Roger’s tech, multiple apple genius appointments etc.  \n\n  \nthe other day I took my sons SIM card from his iPhone 12 that has a freedom mobile plan, put it into the 16 pro max, and the games loaded up. go figure. If I use either of my kids hotspots (other kid has my old 14 pro max) it works. Seems that would rule out the iPhone 16 being an issue and maybe it’s with Rogers ?  the internet works, most websites if not all work YouTube email etc but if I load battlenet launcher app… error and the ads don’t even load up. if I try opening Warcraft 3 I get stuck at the lion screen for 30 seconds and get a 6:9 error. If I open Fortnite it opens the launcher and will download the game, update the game.. but loads up but Gives a connection error at the end before going to the lobby. Steam just says connection error.  I have a 5G 150gb plan.  \n\n\nAt my wits end with this it’s been 1 year since I got the 16 pro max and I haven’t been able to take my laptop to work or to the kids soccer practices where we have to wait outside for 3 hours (not allowed in the gyms).. especially during the winter is where I could kill time doing some gaming while I waited (and a little work. \n\nAny insight or input would be appreciated !  Thinking to switch to the galaxy 26 when it releases if I can’t get it to work with this phone. \n\nTIA !",

Lightning was revolutionary for its ability to just go in the damn hole regardless of whether you inserted it at the perfect angle. I’ll be damned if lightning wasn’t the most buttery-smooth charger I’ve ever used. It’s like one day Apple woke up and realized that chargers could be shaped better, proceeded to make the best-shaped charger ever shaped, then completely forgot they did any of that and went back to cumbersome, scratchy ports. \n\nRant over.",

    "title": "Wanted to share my phone case experience and recommendation",
    "selftext": "First and foremost I’m not employed or sponsored by any of these companies. I don’t work for a company that makes phone cases at all. Since as long as I can remember, I’ve always had Speck cases and when they came out with the Candyshell Grip, that’s all I ever bought for my iPhones for probably 4 or 5 generations (I upgraded every other year).\n\nMy work phone is an iPhone SE 2020 and the candyshell grip case on that has a nice raised edge around the screen, a glossy finish that is somehow grippier than the newer soft touch finish, and rubber ridge grips going from the sides all the way around most of the back.\n\nAt some point Speck changed their cases and the newer Candyshell Grip ones got a soft touch finish which was more slick and greasy feeling to the touch and the rubber ridge was just on the sides. The back didn’t have ridges at all but instead was grooves cut into the back of the case.\n\nNow the CS Grip for the iPhone 17 Pro has molded ridges on the sides and the back again has grooves cut into it and all of it is the soft touch material.\n\nOver these iterations of this case it’s felt like it has become progressively less grippy and now it’s an awful case so I went on the hunt for a new one.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far and my experience with it:\n\nSpeck Candyshell Grip - $40 - (RIP - I’m done with this until they improve it back to the original design). Good protection but bad grip. The soft touch gives it kind of a greasy feeling. Also, the sides aren’t as raised as they were on the old CS Grip.\n\nSpeck Presidio Grip - $40 - (just as bad as the new Speck CS Grip). Nothing more to say. Good protection but bad grip. The soft touch gives it kind of a greasy feeling.\n\nOtterbox Defender XT Pro - $80 - great grip on the sides, glossy finish on the back which is reasonably grippy if your hands aren’t dry and dehydrated. The problem with this case is it feels much larger so holding the phone feels less secure. Clear back so you can show off the phone’s color. Not terrible but adds too much bulk. I’m also not a fan of how you put the phone in the case. It doesn’t instill confidence since it’s a 2-piece case with the plastic frame being held in by the rubber surround. Doesn’t feel as secure as I’d hoped. I don’t have small hands but I don’t have huge ones either (just over 9” from the top of my pinkie to the top of my thumb with my fingers spread out).\n\nSmartish GripMunk - $25 - not bad. Good grip but it seems like a TPU case so I wanted more protection. Grip is still better than the Speck CS Grip. Inexpensive as well.\n\nSmartish GripZilla - $35 - this is what I have as of yesterday. Much better than the Speck CS Grip. Clear back if you want so you can show off the phone color. This is narrower than the Otterbox case from top to bottom except the corners but even the corners don’t stick out quite as far as the Otterbox. Grip is great and I’d say it’s on par with the Old Speck CS Grip but it is a different pattern and texture.\n\nOverall I’m giving the nod to the Smartish GripZilla over everything else I’ve tried and the fact that it’s less than half the price of the Otterbox Defender XT Pro makes the choice that much easier. Hope this helps anyone trying to decide on a case.",

Whenever I gently shake it, I can feel (and hear) something heavy moving inside, like a small piece shifting slightly.\n\nAt first I thought my case had stretched out or something, but after taking it off, the feeling is still there. I also tested it with the camera app open, and the sound is still present, so I don’t think it’s the image stabilization module or the camera itself.\n\nThere’s also a crack on the back glass, but it’s not falling apart — it’s still intact and doesn’t seem to be loose.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? Could this be the battery, a loose internal component, or something related to the cracked glass?\n\nAny advice before I take it to Apple would be appreciated.",

Initial order got lost in transit when being delivered and UPS was no help for the longest. Luckily I had found one available in my city so I just bought that but still waiting on a refund from the original order. And all that just to have this phone scratched within the case.

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "selftext": "Apparently the demand just isn’t there? This is a device with very real compromises (not a dig, just an objective statement) but I would’ve expected it to sell well enough overall. I genuinely hoped it wouldn’t be another iPhone Mini, but this isn’t what I meant. Does this feel accurate for you, fellow Redditors? Is this one just going to be a slow burn or is it going to fizzle? And if so, why? The b-word is too much a low hanging fruit and they did introduce the MagSafe pack for those times when one really needs the extra juice. If anything I would expect the camera to be the trade-off that might be stopping people, especially those they were already on the iPhone Pro, which was the same price point last year. Especially like to hear from any people that went from a 15 or 16 Pro to the Air. What did you miss? Do you think it will be worth it long time or do you think you may end up trading in again next year? (Or sooner?) This is the first major change in design Apple has made in quite a while so it’s interesting times.\n\nAll I know for sure is I’m in a pretty iPhone heavy microcosm and I’m the kind of guy that notices other people’s devices, as I’m always half feeling the urge to upgrade. But I’ve yet to see *one* iPhone Air in the wild although I’ve seen multiple 17 Pro’s — can’t mistake that plateau and triple array — while I’d expected to see at a couple Airs though.\n\nIt’s also entirely possible that Apple anticipated the air itself might be a flash in the pan and it’s prepared to completely replace it with an “iPhone Fold” or “iPhone Ultra.” Although I expected next year’s lineup to be iPhone, iPhone Air 2, iPhone Ultra. Now I wonder…",

    "selftext": "Every year we argue about titanium vs aluminum, bezels, battery cycles, camera bumps, charging speeds, AI buzzwords, etc… and then we completely ignore the one feature Apple shipped in the last few years that actually changed how you use the phone in daily life. Dynamic Island wasn’t “new hardware”, it was a UX decision. Apple took a problem (the camera cutout) and turned it into UI real estate. Music controls, navigation, timers, live activities, authentication, calls, AirPods, it all lives there now. You don’t think about it, you just use it. And that’s the whole point: good design disappears into behavior.\n\nTake it away tomorrow and I guarantee most people would feel something is “missing” immediately. I can’t say the same about the Action Button or about most of the “new” things Apple ships lately.\n\nThe funniest part to me is that Android manufacturers copy Apple instantly when something is shallow (removing accessories, changing ports, renaming modes, etc), but after 3 years nobody even tried to copy the Dynamic Island. Not because they don’t want to, but because that kind of idea requires real integration between hardware and system UI, not just a checkbox feature.\n\nTo me, Dynamic Island is one of the most quietly brilliant Apple moves in years, and people treat it like a minor bullet point.\n\n",

    "selftext": "So I wanted to share a really disappointing experience with Caudabe today. I figured I’d change things up from the usual Dbrand case. What a mistake.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both got new iPhone Airs and ordered a pair of Caudabe Sheath cases directly from their site. Both arrived this morning, and both had quality issues right out of the box:\n\n•\tThe black Sheath was badly warped, and even came missing the unlock/sleep button, making it completely unusable.\n\n•\tThe green Sheath was also slightly warped and had green shavings around the camera cutout, just like leftover material on a rough 3D print.\n\n•\tThe packaging was undamaged, so this clearly happened before shipping.\n\nGiven Caudabe’s premium pricing, this kind of quality control issue is completely unacceptable. You’d expect something like this from a cheap $10 Amazon case, not from a brand that markets itself as “precise and premium.”\n\nI posted about it on r/Caudabe this morning with photos, just explaining the problem and why it’s so disappointing. Within minutes Reddit displayed:  \n\n“Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Caudabe.”\n\nAlmost immediately after it was taken down, the official Caudabe account opened a private chat asking for my order number. As soon as I mentioned how fast my post was removed and that it looked like they were censoring negative experiences, the chat went completely silent, their account was shown as typing briefly, then never responded again.\n\nTo me, that’s not just bad quality control, it’s unethical brand behavior. Deleting valid customer experiences from their own subreddit to maintain an image doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nAt least when a company like Dbrand messes up, they own it publicly. They let their customers talk openly, fix the issue, and move on with integrity. Caudabe’s approach of silencing criticism while ghosting customers feels shady and erodes trust far more than a few defective cases ever could.\n\nJust a heads-up for anyone thinking about buying from them. Sometimes “minimalist” apparently means minimal accountability, too.",

    "selftext": "Apparently the demand just isn’t there? This is a device with very real compromises (not a dig, just an objective statement) but I would’ve expected it to sell well enough overall. I genuinely hoped it wouldn’t be another iPhone Mini, but this isn’t what I meant. Does this feel accurate for you, fellow Redditors? Is this one just going to be a slow burn or is it going to fizzle? And if so, why? The b-word is too much a low hanging fruit and they did introduce the MagSafe pack for those times when one really needs the extra juice. If anything I would expect the camera to be the trade-off that might be stopping people, especially those they were already on the iPhone Pro, which was the same price point last year. Especially like to hear from any people that went from a 15 or 16 Pro to the Air. What did you miss? Do you think it will be worth it long time or do you think you may end up trading in again next year? (Or sooner?) This is the first major change in design Apple has made in quite a while so it’s interesting times.\n\nAll I know for sure is I’m in a pretty iPhone heavy microcosm and I’m the kind of guy that notices other people’s devices, as I’m always half feeling the urge to upgrade. But I’ve yet to see *one* iPhone Air in the wild although I’ve seen multiple 17 Pro’s — can’t mistake that plateau and triple array — while I’d expected to see at a couple Airs though.\n\nIt’s also entirely possible that Apple anticipated the air itself might be a flash in the pan and it’s prepared to completely replace it with an “iPhone Fold” or “iPhone Ultra.” Although I expected next year’s lineup to be iPhone, iPhone Air 2, iPhone Ultra. Now I wonder…",

    "selftext": "Every year we argue about titanium vs aluminum, bezels, battery cycles, camera bumps, charging speeds, AI buzzwords, etc… and then we completely ignore the one feature Apple shipped in the last few years that actually changed how you use the phone in daily life. Dynamic Island wasn’t “new hardware”, it was a UX decision. Apple took a problem (the camera cutout) and turned it into UI real estate. Music controls, navigation, timers, live activities, authentication, calls, AirPods, it all lives there now. You don’t think about it, you just use it. And that’s the whole point: good design disappears into behavior.\n\nTake it away tomorrow and I guarantee most people would feel something is “missing” immediately. I can’t say the same about the Action Button or about most of the “new” things Apple ships lately.\n\nThe funniest part to me is that Android manufacturers copy Apple instantly when something is shallow (removing accessories, changing ports, renaming modes, etc), but after 3 years nobody even tried to copy the Dynamic Island. Not because they don’t want to, but because that kind of idea requires real integration between hardware and system UI, not just a checkbox feature.\n\nTo me, Dynamic Island is one of the most quietly brilliant Apple moves in years, and people treat it like a minor bullet point.\n\n",

Curious, I checked mine, and it turned out that “M” stands for a new retail device, “F” for a refurbished device, “N” for a replacement device, and “P” for a personalized device with an engraving. I’m wondering if this information is accurate. Additionally, I’m interested in knowing what other people have and if there are any differences between the retail-sold and replacement models. ",

    "selftext": "So I wanted to share a really disappointing experience with Caudabe today. I figured I’d change things up from the usual Dbrand case. What a mistake.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both got new iPhone Airs and ordered a pair of Caudabe Sheath cases directly from their site. Both arrived this morning, and both had quality issues right out of the box:\n\n•\tThe black Sheath was badly warped, and even came missing the unlock/sleep button, making it completely unusable.\n\n•\tThe green Sheath was also slightly warped and had green shavings around the camera cutout, just like leftover material on a rough 3D print.\n\n•\tThe packaging was undamaged, so this clearly happened before shipping.\n\nGiven Caudabe’s premium pricing, this kind of quality control issue is completely unacceptable. You’d expect something like this from a cheap $10 Amazon case, not from a brand that markets itself as “precise and premium.”\n\nI posted about it on r/Caudabe this morning with photos, just explaining the problem and why it’s so disappointing. Within minutes Reddit displayed:  \n\n“Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Caudabe.”\n\nAlmost immediately after it was taken down, the official Caudabe account opened a private chat asking for my order number. As soon as I mentioned how fast my post was removed and that it looked like they were censoring negative experiences, the chat went completely silent, their account was shown as typing briefly, then never responded again.\n\nTo me, that’s not just bad quality control, it’s unethical brand behavior. Deleting valid customer experiences from their own subreddit to maintain an image doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nAt least when a company like Dbrand messes up, they own it publicly. They let their customers talk openly, fix the issue, and move on with integrity. Caudabe’s approach of silencing criticism while ghosting customers feels shady and erodes trust far more than a few defective cases ever could.\n\nJust a heads-up for anyone thinking about buying from them. Sometimes “minimalist” apparently means minimal accountability, too.",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course).

Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed.

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Has *anyone in the general public* actually received their Titan 2 yet?\n2. If yes, how’s it holding up — build quality, battery, keyboard feel, software stability, camera, etc.?\n3. Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Samsung is canceling the upcoming s26 edge completly. but should it?\n\nCurrent reports say its because of poor sales of the 25 edge (only 178k in the first month) vs the other s series (s25 ultra with 1.5m, s25 with more than 1m). \n\nFor my opinion, the poor sales of the s25 edge were caused only because thats a new technology and it was mostly a prototype phone.\nIt had many problems and seemed rushed and unfinished (wasnt that thin, small battery, no telephoto camera). It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have a Google Pixel 8, still under the EU 3-year legal warranty. The phone suddenly stopped working overnight while charging normally.\n\nI sent it for repair through the official Google channel and received a diagnosis of “liquid damage”, with a repair quote of € 644.52 (out of warranty).\n\nHowever, the phone was never exposed to water. I asked Google Support for objective technical evidence (report, photos, LCI readings, methodology, technician ID, etc.), but they said they don’t have any documentation or photos, since the device was returned immediately after I declined the quote.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2019/771 (transposed in Portugal as Decree-Law 84/2021), sellers must provide technical proof when excluding warranty due to alleged misuse — otherwise, the fault is presumed to have existed at delivery.\n\nThe case was escalated to a “second-line” team three days ago, but I haven’t received any update.\n\nHas anyone in the EU experienced a similar situation with Google repairs? Were you able to get photos, a technical report, or have the decision overturned?\n\nI just want a transparent and evidence-based assessment — nothing more, nothing less.",

Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR.

    "selftext": "I was just messing around with settings on my P10 Pro and I discovered an interesting setting. \n\nGames and emulators have been pretty meh on here so far.  Everyone assumed it's a driver issue.  And I think they're right because enabling something called ANGLE seems to improve performance and fixes compatibility for a lot of games.  Here's what I found:\n\nSettings-System-Developer Options-ANGLE Preferences (under Debugging).\n\nGo to the app you want to try and change the OpenGL driver from \"default\" to \"angle\".  Restart the app and give it a go.\n\n**My tests so far:**\n\nDolphin Emulator - Noticeably improved and more stable framerate in Star Fox Adventures and Metroid Prime.  These were both dropping sub-100% emulation speed.  After ANGLE is enabled, they haven't dropped below 100% speed.\n\nRunescape - Framerate and stability massively improved.  Graphical glitches disappeared.  Runs much, much better.\n\nsrceng (via idtech4a++) - Half Life 2 now works.  No more black textures, though there are some glitches still.  It was completely unplayable before this fix.  Portal unfortunately has a nasty flicker I can't seem to fix, but at least it runs now.\n\nOpenMW 0.50 - Seems to be quite a bit more stable with my modded setup.  Still some stutters here and there, but seems smoother overall.\n\nSubnautica - This ran ok to begin with, but it feels overall smoother and more stable with ANGLE enabled.\n\nI don't fully understand what this does, but I believe it's a translation layer between the GPU and Vulkan, translating each GPU call into something the GPU fully understands.  And since the PowerVR GPU drivers are currently buggy as hell, this fixes a lot of issues.\n\nI feel like this basically confirms a lot of the GPU issues are a driver issue (updated soon hopefully?!) since the translation layer fixes quite a bit from what I can tell.",

I typically pick up the latest Pixel every two years for free or $5 or $10 month (Max!) plus cost of my plan $50/month unlimited. Easy.\n\nMy wife and kids all try for the newest iPhone they can get and pay handsomely for it. Wife pays $70/month (full purchase), kids pay between $15 and $30 per month on 24 month return plans. (We're all about $50 for talk text and data).\n\nFYI - kids pay for their phones and usage. \n\n\nI would like them to switch to save money as well as to not be so materialistic going forward as the orange man sends us all spiralling towards an economic depression.\n\nHas anyone successfully encouraged the switch with their loved ones?\n What are the incentives you used? \nAre there any youtube blogs relatable to terms to help? \n\nTIA\n\n",

The *exact* nightmare scenario I told myself I was safe from because I have the new Pixel 9.\n\nSo I pull it out, tap on the emergency SOS... and I get a \"Feature not available in your location\" message.\n\nIn Mexico.\n\nAre you f\\*cking kidding me? Satellites are GLOBAL. They don't just stop at the U.S. border. This isn't a tech problem, this is a \"Google couldn't be bothered\" problem.\n\nThis is North America. It works in the US. It works in Canada. But not in the massive country sitting right between them where millions of people travel, hike, and boat in remote areas all the time?\n\nI can't even describe that feeling in my gut. Going from \"Okay, we're in trouble, but I have a high-tech solution\" to \"Oh my god, we are completely screwed\" in one second.\n\nWe got lucky. Unbelievably lucky. A local netter saw us drifting and towed us back to shore. A total stranger in a tiny boat, not my $1,000 \"smart\" phone, was our rescue. I'm so grateful to him.\n\nBut I'm furious at Google. This is a life-saving feature being marketed as a reason to buy their phone, and it’s neutered by borders. It's a joke.\n\nJust a warning to everyone else: Don't you *ever* bet your life on this feature if you're traveling. It’s a gimmick until it works everywhere.\n\n**TL;DR: Boat ran out of gas in Mexico. Pixel 9 Satellite SOS doesn't work there. Saved by a local fisherman. The feature is a complete liability and a joke.**",

After perusing the available phones with my carrier, I found the pixel phones to have a nice look and I’ve heard they have good cameras! My problem… it feels like I can’t research a phone without finding reddit people listing at least 10 horrible things about it. \n\nSo, I’m wondering how the switch is from iPhone to Pixel. How does the battery life compare? For context, I’m looking at the Pixel 9 Pro, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. I have embarrassing high screen time. I enjoy watching movies and tv shows on my phone (through streaming apps). I also play some games that demand a lot of battery life (ex. Pokemon Go). \n\nFor pictures, I want to take beautiful pictures of my loved ones. That’s all I really care about. I don’t like the beautified, filtered look of photos from Samsung. \n\nI use a lot of google products already (google calendar, gmail, google photos, etc.)\n\nThanks for any/all advice!!",

The other one I'm noticing is that background data usage gets turned back on with all of my apps after a restart. ",

AVEZ does allow this however when I go to send an image over social media it doesn't give me the option to use AVEZ, therefore I cannot navigate to the desired group and album which I require. I need this option as part of my business as I create a business album, then sort each clients pictures into their own album within the business grouping. \n\nPs I have tried settings-apps-default apps but it doesn't give an option for gallery. I also do not want to disable Google photos as I like it for backing up photos. \n\nThanks for any help",

Unfortunately, my screen had a crack in the upper corner, and as per their policy, they had to replace it. So I had to pay INR 7249. Got it in 4 hours. They urged a five-star review, and that's fine.\n\nWithin 3 weeks, the screen started going black in the area where the fingerprint sensor is. I took it to the store and they agreed as it was <90 days for a free replacement. \n\nAfter a while, they opened it and they said they found water inside the phone. I casually mentioned, it must have been the rain. They charged me another INR 850 for an investigation, and they came back with a back panel and droplets in a specific area. Not trying to accuse them, but it did look fresh. Not sure any phone can handle that. \n\nUltimately rejected the warranty and said it'll cost me INR 26K for a new display, motherboard, camera and battery, so maybe get a new phone. I asked the lady, but how is the time being shown if the motherboard is gone? She said it's temporary and it'll stop working soon.\n\n  \nIt's been more than 10 days since this incident, and my phone works perfectly well apart from the display. I am using Google Talkback and Google Assistant, and it works just as normal (Alarms, calls, messages). Had to use a USB keyboard to unlock after switching on, else it unlocks via face. All with a blank display. I have important data and banking apps in there.\n\nTried writing to the Google service, but they don't care. Scripted emails about how they are \"actively investigating\" for more than a week.\n\n  \nWhat are my options here? Have any of you faced any similar situations? \n\n  \nPS: Even tried casting the phone using an HDMI cable, unfortunately, it's available from Pixel 8 series. ",

I pulled out my Pixel 9 Pro (still on Camera 9.9) and compared... yup. They flipped the sliders. That's moderately annoying considering most people probably don't study the brightness/shadows icons that well and a surprise change like this can result in a very frustrating experience if you're used to these sliders from years ago.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/nakHWuh.png",

Thanks 😊",

No matter how many times I try to turn them on, they immediately turn off again by themselves.\n\nIt’s super frustrating — I’ve tried everything I could think of:\n\n* Restarted the phone → didn’t work\n* Reset network settings → no luck\n* Restarted Bluetooth and Wi-Fi → still nothing\n* Even did a full factory reset → problem still there\n\nTook it to a technician, and he said it *might* be a loose connection on the board that controls Wi-Fi/Bluetooth. But after opening it up, everything looked totally fine, no physical issues.\n\nSo now I’m stuck. No clue what to do next. For now, I guess I’ll just wait for the next monthly update (the one they usually drop on the first Monday of the month) and hope that somehow fixes it.\n\nReally sucks to have paid this much for a phone and end up dealing with stuff like this. It shouldn't be happening.\n\nAny ideas?",

    "selftext": "I've had issues with my Pixel 9 Pro since I got it in December.\n\nTo describe the issues, it starts with the autobrightness. In dim light, the screen will be at full brightness. Adjusting the brightness scale will only change the hue where \"dimmest\" setting is teal and \"brightess\" setting is red and the middle is neutral. u/Raychii took a video of the exact issue. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1k8s7qh/intermittent_screen_discolouration_on_pixel_9_pro/mp8pghn/ When this happens, the always on display will not work either. The full brightness in a dark room burns my eyes when I try to use my phone.\n\nI tolerated it this long because I used to be able to \"force\" the autobrightness to work by adjusting the brightness scale to the middle two times in a row. It would finally adjust the brightness and the always on display would work.\n\nBut that would stop working again when I put my phone in my pocket and walked around. The brightness would be 100% again with the same issues described above.\n\nLately, some new update disabled that workaround. The phone has a mind of its own when I can adjust the brightness. You cannot imagine my frustration of wanting to throw the phone against the wall when it's on 100% brightness all the time. I might end up trading the phone and going back to Samsung if I can't find a fix.",

Come to find out it was none of these (in my case). I finally decided to just disable 5gUW, turned on wifi, turned off doze stopper, and reenabled all the optimisation settings just for the hell of it and wouldn't you know it, I got all my notifications without a hitch. No delay, and every notification told me what exactly it was notifying me of. \n\nWhen I was on IOS I never had this issue, and this is a really big bummer for me cause I switched to pixel because I wanted to try out android since it's been so long and the pixel felt like the most iphone feeling android device so it made switching easier. Sadly tho, I'm more of a first impressions kind of guy so I'm probably going back to IOS after dealing with this headache for almost 2 months. Now I only use 5gUW if I can't get wifi signal anywhere which blows cause now a feature I pay for is severely hindered.",

    "selftext": "Context: I live in Germany and Google support has offered me the option to send me a replacement device for my month old Pixel 9 due to potential OLED image retention/burn-in issues (anyone else with this issue?)\n\nWas wondering if anyone has experience RMA-ing Pixels in Germany, because I have a few questions:\n\n1. Do they reject your RMA claims even for the slightest cosmetic damage? (My phone has a single minor hairline scratch on the screen and based on the other stories about RMA in the EU, I'm worried I'm going to have to go without a phone for 2 weeks only for my claim to get rejected and I cannot afford to go without a phone for so long)\n\n\n2. Does it actually take 5-10 business days as Google says, or is it longer? Does the phone get shipped to Poland?\n\n\n3. Do they always only send refurbished replacements or do they send new ones sometimes too? (One support agent told me the device will be brand new, the other one wasn't so clear, but I don't think I can rely on their word because based on other stories in this sub, there seems to be no consistency b/w their support agents and what their actual RMA/repair partner in Europe does, let alone among their own support agents itself)\n\n\nI was also told by Google support that I could get my phone repaired at Comspot (Google's authorized repair partner in Germany). They offer walk-in same-day repairs. My only gripe with this is repairing the phone instead of replacing it may void the water resistance rating, which is a real shame for a phone that's only a month old.\n\n\nWhat do y'all think? Should I risk RMA-ing it, or wait it out, see how the burn-in situation goes and based on that just go to the repair center (Comspot)?",

Lately I can stare at my watch for 15-30 seconds while walking around and not see it update... then all the sudden it'll add a few 100 steps.   \n   * Note, I restarted the watch and it seems to mostly be working now?\n   * I'm not sure what caused this, possibly turning off my phone?  Leaving my watch to function 100% independently and then when my phone was back in proximity it glitched out?\n* I've had frequent issues where attempting to unlock my device, it acts like it's unlocked but won't load any app icons and shows a blank background image.  I press the lock button and try again and it works. \n   * This isn't unique to a Pixel 10 experience, most phones every so often do this but seems far more common on my pixel 10?",

    "selftext": "I was just messing around with settings on my P10 Pro and I discovered an interesting setting. \n\nGames and emulators have been pretty meh on here so far.  Everyone assumed it's a driver issue.  And I think they're right because enabling something called ANGLE seems to improve performance and fixes compatibility for a lot of games.  Here's what I found:\n\nSettings-System-Developer Options-ANGLE Preferences (under Debugging).\n\nGo to the app you want to try and change the OpenGL driver from \"default\" to \"angle\".  Restart the app and give it a go.\n\n**My tests so far:**\n\nDolphin Emulator - Noticeably improved and more stable framerate in Star Fox Adventures and Metroid Prime.  These were both dropping sub-100% emulation speed.  After ANGLE is enabled, they haven't dropped below 100% speed.\n\nRunescape - Framerate and stability massively improved.  Graphical glitches disappeared.  Runs much, much better.\n\nsrceng (via idtech4a++) - Half Life 2 now works.  No more black textures, though there are some glitches still.  It was completely unplayable before this fix.  Portal unfortunately has a nasty flicker I can't seem to fix, but at least it runs now.\n\nOpenMW 0.50 - Seems to be quite a bit more stable with my modded setup.  Still some stutters here and there, but seems smoother overall.\n\nSubnautica - This ran ok to begin with, but it feels overall smoother and more stable with ANGLE enabled.\n\nI don't fully understand what this does, but I believe it's a translation layer between the GPU and Vulkan, translating each GPU call into something the GPU fully understands.  And since the PowerVR GPU drivers are currently buggy as hell, this fixes a lot of issues.\n\nI feel like this basically confirms a lot of the GPU issues are a driver issue (updated soon hopefully?!) since the translation layer fixes quite a bit from what I can tell.",

It cashes at least once a week, where I will be doing anything even during a important call and it will just fully shut down and not turn on for about 10-20 minutes.

My problem… it feels like I can’t research a phone without finding reddit people listing at least 10 horrible things about it. \n\nSo, I’m wondering how the switch is from iPhone to Pixel. How does the battery life compare? For context, I’m looking at the Pixel 9 Pro, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. I have embarrassing high screen time. I enjoy watching movies and tv shows on my phone (through streaming apps). I also play some games that demand a lot of battery life (ex. Pokemon Go). \n\nFor pictures, I want to take beautiful pictures of my loved ones. That’s all I really care about. I don’t like the beautified, filtered look of photos from Samsung. \n\nI use a lot of google products already (google calendar, gmail, google photos, etc.)\n\nThanks for any/all advice!!",

AVEZ does allow this however when I go to send an image over social media it doesn't give me the option to use AVEZ, therefore I cannot navigate to the desired group and album which I require. I need this option as part of my business as I create a business album, then sort each clients pictures into their own album within the business grouping. \n\nPs I have tried settings-apps-default apps but it doesn't give an option for gallery.

Unfortunately, my screen had a crack in the upper corner, and as per their policy, they had to replace it. So I had to pay INR 7249. Got it in 4 hours. They urged a five-star review, and that's fine.\n\nWithin 3 weeks, the screen started going black in the area where the fingerprint sensor is. I took it to the store and they agreed as it was <90 days for a free replacement. \n\nAfter a while, they opened it and they said they found water inside the phone. I casually mentioned, it must have been the rain. They charged me another INR 850 for an investigation, and they came back with a back panel and droplets in a specific area. Not trying to accuse them, but it did look fresh. Not sure any phone can handle that. \n\nUltimately rejected the warranty and said it'll cost me INR 26K for a new display, motherboard, camera and battery, so maybe get a new phone. I asked the lady, but how is the time being shown if the motherboard is gone? She said it's temporary and it'll stop working soon.\n\n  \nIt's been more than 10 days since this incident, and my phone works perfectly well apart from the display. I am using Google Talkback and Google Assistant, and it works just as normal (Alarms, calls, messages). Had to use a USB keyboard to unlock after switching on, else it unlocks via face. All with a blank display. I have important data and banking apps in there.\n\nTried writing to the Google service, but they don't care. Scripted emails about how they are \"actively investigating\" for more than a week.\n\n  \nWhat are my options here? Have any of you faced any similar situations? \n\n  \nPS: Even tried casting the phone using an HDMI cable, unfortunately, it's available from Pixel 8 series. ",

    "selftext": "I was just messing around with settings on my P10 Pro and I discovered an interesting setting. \n\nGames and emulators have been pretty meh on here so far.  Everyone assumed it's a driver issue.  And I think they're right because enabling something called ANGLE seems to improve performance and fixes compatibility for a lot of games.  Here's what I found:\n\nSettings-System-Developer Options-ANGLE Preferences (under Debugging).\n\nGo to the app you want to try and change the OpenGL driver from \"default\" to \"angle\".  Restart the app and give it a go.\n\n**My tests so far:**\n\nDolphin Emulator - Noticeably improved and more stable framerate in Star Fox Adventures and Metroid Prime.  These were both dropping sub-100% emulation speed.  After ANGLE is enabled, they haven't dropped below 100% speed.\n\nRunescape - Framerate and stability massively improved.  Graphical glitches disappeared.  Runs much, much better.\n\nsrceng (via idtech4a++) - Half Life 2 now works.  No more black textures, though there are some glitches still.  It was completely unplayable before this fix.  Portal unfortunately has a nasty flicker I can't seem to fix, but at least it runs now.\n\nOpenMW 0.50 - Seems to be quite a bit more stable with my modded setup.  Still some stutters here and there, but seems smoother overall.\n\nSubnautica - This ran ok to begin with, but it feels overall smoother and more stable with ANGLE enabled.\n\nI don't fully understand what this does, but I believe it's a translation layer between the GPU and Vulkan, translating each GPU call into something the GPU fully understands.  And since the PowerVR GPU drivers are currently buggy as hell, this fixes a lot of issues.\n\nI feel like this basically confirms a lot of the GPU issues are a driver issue (updated soon hopefully?!) since the translation layer fixes quite a bit from what I can tell.",

My problem… it feels like I can’t research a phone without finding reddit people listing at least 10 horrible things about it. \n\nSo, I’m wondering how the switch is from iPhone to Pixel. How does the battery life compare? For context, I’m looking at the Pixel 9 Pro, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. I have embarrassing high screen time. I enjoy watching movies and tv shows on my phone (through streaming apps). I also play some games that demand a lot of battery life (ex.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, please pardon the long post, I am very excited for my phone. I am just about to graduate school and I proimised myself to get a new phone if I got a full time offer (which I did!) - Mint Mobile had the Pixel 10 Pro XL up for grabs for just $600, so I ended up getting Jade. I got the Otterbox Symmetry Case to show off the color.\n\nI prev. used a Pixel 6 with Spigen's Wallet case ([reference](https://partners.spigen.com/products/pixel-6-series-case-slim-armor-cs?variant=44016021471432)) - since my phone has my work ID and transit card, I'm fine if I forget my wallet, which I would like to continue.\n\nI wanted to get a matching snap-on wallet for the Jade 10 Pro XL, so I ordered:  \n\\- MOFT [Earthen Beige](https://www.amazon.com/MOFT-Magnetic-Compatible-Adjustment-Magsafe/dp/B0DJ73FP6X?th=1): Unlike the images, I received a grey  thing.  \n  \n\\- So I have ordered MOFT's [Peach Pink](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDB1NFXC?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1). I fear being a guy it will come off as girlish? Not that I care if it matches the phone well.\n\n\\- Bellroy has a Tahini color wallet too - [link](https://bellroy.com/products/mag-wallet?color=innovera_tahini&material=innovera#slide-0)\n\nThese are just a few I had shortlisted, but if by chance any of you had better recommendations that matches the gold-ish accents or just the jade colorway that will be much appreciated!",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

Now I’m looking at the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra and wanted to hear from people who’ve spent time with them.\n\nOn paper they seem very close, but I’m curious about how they actually feel day to day. How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

The picture doesn't do it justice but it's looks pretty close to this. I've tried adjusting so many different settings and nothing seems to work. Is there something that I am missing? Do I need to turn on something specific? ",

But that was my fault to not have backup.\n\n\n\nAnyway, i gotten a cheap Xiaomi phone to use until i was back to my country since i acquired Samsung care+.\n\nOnce returned and submitted it to the Samsung costumer center they mentioned few times, it will be a free repair unless water damage is detected.\n\nOf course, i kept the phone relatively well, but it received its shares of water splashes, and knowing very well what waterproof mean in the phone world i was ready to pay the 93\\~USD of screen change out of warranty. (The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra?

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

The sensor difference & new settings have genuinely amazed me. I just can't switch to the new band yet, I'm too attached to my old one.

I don’t have to do that anymore. \n5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.\n\nQuirks\n- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed.

Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "title": "My Unlocked S25 Ultra from BestBuy Disabled After 6 Months",
    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I’ve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

    "title": "The S25 Edge is just stupid good.",
    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "title": "Here's how I fixed up my galaxy watch 8c battery issue.",
    "selftext": "This is a post to help you folks who are stuck with a watch that dies in 8 hours.\n\nBefore I start, let me just clarify that I don't have a fixed solution for you. I'll tell you what I tried, and what worked.\n\nI got my galaxy watch 8c LTE edition on September 13th. Bought it from a store, enabled whatever I wanted, used it.\nIt took me a couple of days to realize that the battery dies within the day.\n\nI started measuring. I was wearing it to sleep, I was using it to exercise, I was using it like how a proper smart watch is supposed to be used. On an average I got 10-12 hours out of it. 10% battery drain per hour.\n\nI started looking into solutions. Searched reddit, forums, samsung issue resolutions.\n\nSome had this issue because of the Gemini constantly listening. Some had it because they had AOD on. But these folks already had a battery life that spanned atleast 20+ hours. This fix wasn't for me.\n\nThen the next group of people had a solution - clear the cache partition or do a factory reset. Or do both.\nFor some, the cache clear worked. For some the reset did. For some, doing both did it.\n\nSo started my 2 week long experimenting on improving battery life.\n\nClearing cahe partition didn't do much. I cleared again. Nothing.\nI reset the watch. Still showed 12 hours.\n\nSomeone pointed out to do it twice - no idea why - but tried that.\nStill the same.\n\nAfter 3 days of trial and error, my watch suddenly showed 22hrs.\nI didn't do anything much. I had cleared the partition and reset the watch earlier that day.\n\nHoping it would improve again, I repeated this process - twice.\nAfter setting it up as a new watch for God knows how many times, it switched back to showing 12-15h.\n\nHere is when I noticed that the battery drain has a direct correlation with the network settings.. \nI checked my connection settings - wifi, mobile data etc were set to auto. That would mean that when my phone was away, they would use what's needed and would be off when I'm using it with my phone nearby. \n\nBut it seemed that the watch was not turning it off. It was connected to my watch, but not always through bluetooth. It would switch sometimes to wifi and LTE even when the phone was in my pocket. \n\nThis was the root cause. Don't know what caused it, but my samsung phone was not exactly paired to my samsung watch.\n\nI cleared cache partition. That didn't do much. I hard reset the watch multiple times till I ensured it was pairing properly.\n\nAnd immediately I got 1day+12 hours battery life. That's the same amount as promised by samsung with everything on.\n\nAll you have to do is just check if only bluetooth is enabled on the watch menu while your phone is near.\n\nDo some hard resets, clear cache - as many times as needed to ensure only bluetooth icon is visible when phone is near. The wifi and LTE symbols should be off if you're normally wearing your watch. Update your settings to auto. This will get you 1.5 days of battery life with AOD off. If you need more than 36 hours of battery life, then do the things others did - turn off AOD, switch off Gemini, set heart rate to measure every 10 mins etc. that's gonna get u that 2 day battery life.\n\n I still don't know why or what's causing it. Maybe my phone has too many bluetooth devices connected to it. Maybe my watch hates my phone in secret. Who knows. But this should fix it.\n\ntldr; read last 3 paragraphs. Good luck.\n\nPS : not a native English speaker. Sorry for the language.\n\n",

Ive got quite a slim wrist and now my question is, would the 44mm would fit good if i would use other bands then the Standard one? I ofc i like the 44mm better because it has more battery and a bigger screen tho, the 40mm looks better on my wrist but if it still wouldnt fit better with other bands i might have to pay 80€ more to get the 40mm at standard price :( please let me know if anyone ever encounterd this problem",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\n  \ni really am intrested in the watch 8 classic and i already found a acceptable price for 284€. The thing is the shop claims it as \"eu\" modell but also sells the german modell for almost double the price.\n\n  \nAfter doing research, some folks said that maybe services like samsung pay or other tracking features might not be working, but noone could give an clear answer.\n\n  \nDo you guys have any ideas? Will i be alright when purchasing the eu modell for much less?",

If you are having an issue when your Galaxy watch goes into a sleep mode where the always on display and raise to wake are being turned off and not turned back on when you wake up, this is for you. Go into your modes and routines and just toggle those settings off in the sleep mode. I know that this is not ideal if you want it to turn on and off automatically however I don't think that having these things on while sleeping really affects wearing the watch much. ",

Albeit the stress reading was accurate before (ok I only got the watch on Friday) still, since today it's all over the place and as I am lounging at home that doesn't make much sense. I tested it with my old Huawei watch that says I am cool as a cucumber with it, while gw7 on the other arm says I am highly stressed (lol I am not, I should know, I have a masters in psychology lol). Really the only things that would have made this interesting are the vascular load and the anti oxidant index which are not included. All that hype for so little...

The other 2 moderators have been inactive for a few months, so I’ve taken over the role as top moderator for the community. I’ve been doing some spring cleaning and updates, with the biggest changes being:\n\n\n\n* The rules list is much clearer and more detailed\n* The rule on Watch Face Posts is now:\n   * Pictures of real watches are allowed, but advertisements are not.\n   * See the included image as an example\n\n\n\nSome other smaller changes:\n\n\n\n* More “Similar Communities” subreddits are on the sidebar\n* Flairs have been cleaned up slightly and might be combined in the future.\n* The backlog of unprocessed rule violation reports has been actioned and cleared\n   * If your post or comment was accidentally removed, let me know!\n* A comment sticky has been created clarifying the new Watch Face Post rule\n\n\n\nWe will be doing a call for moderators in the future. Stay tuned!\n\n\n\nDo you have any feedback or requests you’d like to share about the state of the subreddit? Please let me know!\n\n",

    "title": "Here's how I fixed up my galaxy watch 8c battery issue.",
    "selftext": "This is a post to help you folks who are stuck with a watch that dies in 8 hours.\n\nBefore I start, let me just clarify that I don't have a fixed solution for you. I'll tell you what I tried, and what worked.\n\nI got my galaxy watch 8c LTE edition on September 13th. Bought it from a store, enabled whatever I wanted, used it.\nIt took me a couple of days to realize that the battery dies within the day.\n\nI started measuring. I was wearing it to sleep, I was using it to exercise, I was using it like how a proper smart watch is supposed to be used. On an average I got 10-12 hours out of it. 10% battery drain per hour.\n\nI started looking into solutions. Searched reddit, forums, samsung issue resolutions.\n\nSome had this issue because of the Gemini constantly listening. Some had it because they had AOD on. But these folks already had a battery life that spanned atleast 20+ hours. This fix wasn't for me.\n\nThen the next group of people had a solution - clear the cache partition or do a factory reset. Or do both.\nFor some, the cache clear worked. For some the reset did. For some, doing both did it.\n\nSo started my 2 week long experimenting on improving battery life.\n\nClearing cahe partition didn't do much. I cleared again. Nothing.\nI reset the watch. Still showed 12 hours.\n\nSomeone pointed out to do it twice - no idea why - but tried that.\nStill the same.\n\nAfter 3 days of trial and error, my watch suddenly showed 22hrs.\nI didn't do anything much. I had cleared the partition and reset the watch earlier that day.\n\nHoping it would improve again, I repeated this process - twice.\nAfter setting it up as a new watch for God knows how many times, it switched back to showing 12-15h.\n\nHere is when I noticed that the battery drain has a direct correlation with the network settings.. \nI checked my connection settings - wifi, mobile data etc were set to auto. That would mean that when my phone was away, they would use what's needed and would be off when I'm using it with my phone nearby. \n\nBut it seemed that the watch was not turning it off. It was connected to my watch, but not always through bluetooth. It would switch sometimes to wifi and LTE even when the phone was in my pocket. \n\nThis was the root cause. Don't know what caused it, but my samsung phone was not exactly paired to my samsung watch.\n\nI cleared cache partition. That didn't do much. I hard reset the watch multiple times till I ensured it was pairing properly.\n\nAnd immediately I got 1day+12 hours battery life. That's the same amount as promised by samsung with everything on.\n\nAll you have to do is just check if only bluetooth is enabled on the watch menu while your phone is near.\n\nDo some hard resets, clear cache - as many times as needed to ensure only bluetooth icon is visible when phone is near. The wifi and LTE symbols should be off if you're normally wearing your watch. Update your settings to auto. This will get you 1.5 days of battery life with AOD off. If you need more than 36 hours of battery life, then do the things others did - turn off AOD, switch off Gemini, set heart rate to measure every 10 mins etc. that's gonna get u that 2 day battery life.\n\n I still don't know why or what's causing it. Maybe my phone has too many bluetooth devices connected to it. Maybe my watch hates my phone in secret. Who knows. But this should fix it.\n\ntldr; read last 3 paragraphs. Good luck.\n\nPS : not a native English speaker. Sorry for the language.\n\n",

I ofc i like the 44mm better because it has more battery and a bigger screen tho, the 40mm looks better on my wrist but if it still wouldnt fit better with other bands i might have to pay 80€ more to get the 40mm at standard price :( please let me know if anyone ever encounterd this problem",

It downloads, tries to install, and then just gives me the generic \"try again later\" notification.\n\nI've already tried the usual troubleshooting steps:\n\n* Restarting both my phone and the watch.\n* Ensuring a stable Wi-Fi connection for both devices.\n* I even did a full factory reset of the watch.\n\nNothing has worked so far.\n\nIs anyone else facing this problem with their GW7? Or more importantly, has anyone found a fix or a workaround to get the update to install properly?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nEDIT: VPN was the Problem. With VPN On the \"copying to watch\" stage is failing.",

Still, I’m happy I didn’t overspend just to chase the newest trend. 😅\n\nNow I’m looking to pick up a **Galaxy Watch Classic** to go with it. I want something that feels premium, lasts a few years, and doesn’t make me feel like I have to upgrade every time Samsung releases a new one. Basically, something that’s good enough to keep and forget about the hype cycle.\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking:\n\n* **Watch 4 Classic** – budget-friendly, but maybe too dated now?\n* **Watch 6 Classic** – seems like the sweet spot for value and performance.\n* **Watch 8 Classic** – newer, but not sure if the price jump is worth it.\n\nFor anyone rocking a Fold + Watch combo:  \nWhich Classic model do you think hits the best balance between **price, features, and longevity**?  \nI’m aiming for that “buy it once and chill” kind of setup.

    "title": "Here's how I fixed up my galaxy watch 8c battery issue.",
    "selftext": "This is a post to help you folks who are stuck with a watch that dies in 8 hours.\n\nBefore I start, let me just clarify that I don't have a fixed solution for you. I'll tell you what I tried, and what worked.\n\nI got my galaxy watch 8c LTE edition on September 13th. Bought it from a store, enabled whatever I wanted, used it.\nIt took me a couple of days to realize that the battery dies within the day.\n\nI started measuring. I was wearing it to sleep, I was using it to exercise, I was using it like how a proper smart watch is supposed to be used. On an average I got 10-12 hours out of it. 10% battery drain per hour.\n\nI started looking into solutions. Searched reddit, forums, samsung issue resolutions.\n\nSome had this issue because of the Gemini constantly listening. Some had it because they had AOD on. But these folks already had a battery life that spanned atleast 20+ hours. This fix wasn't for me.\n\nThen the next group of people had a solution - clear the cache partition or do a factory reset. Or do both.\nFor some, the cache clear worked. For some the reset did. For some, doing both did it.\n\nSo started my 2 week long experimenting on improving battery life.\n\nClearing cahe partition didn't do much. I cleared again. Nothing.\nI reset the watch. Still showed 12 hours.\n\nSomeone pointed out to do it twice - no idea why - but tried that.\nStill the same.\n\nAfter 3 days of trial and error, my watch suddenly showed 22hrs.\nI didn't do anything much. I had cleared the partition and reset the watch earlier that day.\n\nHoping it would improve again, I repeated this process - twice.\nAfter setting it up as a new watch for God knows how many times, it switched back to showing 12-15h.\n\nHere is when I noticed that the battery drain has a direct correlation with the network settings.. \nI checked my connection settings - wifi, mobile data etc were set to auto. That would mean that when my phone was away, they would use what's needed and would be off when I'm using it with my phone nearby. \n\nBut it seemed that the watch was not turning it off. It was connected to my watch, but not always through bluetooth. It would switch sometimes to wifi and LTE even when the phone was in my pocket. \n\nThis was the root cause. Don't know what caused it, but my samsung phone was not exactly paired to my samsung watch.\n\nI cleared cache partition. That didn't do much. I hard reset the watch multiple times till I ensured it was pairing properly.\n\nAnd immediately I got 1day+12 hours battery life. That's the same amount as promised by samsung with everything on.\n\nAll you have to do is just check if only bluetooth is enabled on the watch menu while your phone is near.\n\nDo some hard resets, clear cache - as many times as needed to ensure only bluetooth icon is visible when phone is near. The wifi and LTE symbols should be off if you're normally wearing your watch. Update your settings to auto. This will get you 1.5 days of battery life with AOD off. If you need more than 36 hours of battery life, then do the things others did - turn off AOD, switch off Gemini, set heart rate to measure every 10 mins etc. that's gonna get u that 2 day battery life.\n\n I still don't know why or what's causing it. Maybe my phone has too many bluetooth devices connected to it. Maybe my watch hates my phone in secret. Who knows. But this should fix it.\n\ntldr; read last 3 paragraphs. Good luck.\n\nPS : not a native English speaker. Sorry for the language.\n\n",

I am wanting to know how I can tell if a panel is going to be compatible. And also if I would be able to get a screen that has a higher resolution, and use that in the laptop without any trouble.\n\n\nBasic information about me to explain my writing:\n\n● My special interest is technology particularly the hardware (especially retro and older and vintage technology), but I am also really interested in many other things as well.\n\n● I can easily have short(ish) side tangents.\n\n● I am often very to the point and as a result sometime might sound like a chat bot (yes this has happened to me before)\n\n● I also have a really strong passion for reducing ewaste and giving things a new home, I am working with a group called the Lions Club to bring computers to families and especially children who are in financially struggling for free. We are talking complete setups; desktop, mouse, keyboard, screen, installed and setup OS, cables. And hopefully soon this will include laptops, all of the items are refurbished and can come from business or even ewaste if it is in good enough condition, and I am able to work with stuff from the core 2 duo era onwards.\n\n● I am self taught in a lot of the skills that I have, and even though I am 22, I have done a lot of work with hardware stuff for years almost 8 years now, and have been able to demonstrate knowledge and skill that people have said are well beyond my year especially when it comes to my abilities, so don't underestimate me with what I am able to understand, am willing to try, and even what I can achieve. (I am not trying to boast or anything, I am just trying to let people know that I am am likely able to understand quite a lot so you don't need to worry too much about me not understanding something.)\n\n\n\nNow that you know a bit more about me, here is what the post is about:\n\nSo for the basic run down of the situation I am in right now. I have some older laptops with one being a HP Folio 13 2000 that I have decided to turn into my Linux an other OSs laptop, and it has a single finger lid opening, and this thing is really well used, but not worn (as in it is clear the laptop was used well previously, but wasn't abused), I only wish it came with a 1600x900 IPS LCD screen, but 1366x768 is still a pretty good resolution for what I need (I sometimes feel like I might be a bit of an oddity in the fact that I really like 4:3/5:4 aspect ratios and my favourite resolution is 1280x1024), but I am planning on upgrading the screen to an IPS LCD screen since it is just a basic TN LCD screen, and the viewing angles are absolutely abysmal. I am also wondering if I would be able to get a better resolution for it as well without any trouble?\n\nDoes anyone know how I can tell if a panel will be compatible with the laptop? It is 13.3\" and has a 40 pin connector.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any help with this.",

I’d prefer it to have at least an RTX 4060 graphics card, good thermals, and decent battery life. My budget’s around ₹1.2–1.3 lakh max.

    "selftext": "My laptop has recently started to make very quiet crackling noises near the battery of my Lenovo X13 Yoga (1 year 3 months old).\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/CIhYtGQ](https://imgur.com/a/CIhYtGQ) The area at which the noise comes from is here.\n\nIt doesn't sound like it's coming from the fan as the fan noise clearly comes from a different area of my laptop. I suspect it's the battery because the crackling comes from around the area where there is a vent for the battery at the back of my laptop.\n\nWhen I close my laptop or shut it down, the crackling stops even if the fans continue running. Additionally, the crackling appears to stop when my laptop is very cold (I could be wrong).\n\nMy laptop gets quite hot (\\~90 C) when I have multiple apps and browser tabs open. Has anyone experienced this issue? My battery warranty unfortunately expired 3 months ago but I would be willing to purchase a new one.",

So, I’ve decided to get a new device as a whole. if anyone has any recommendations that would be nice! I’m going for laptop that can handle light editing and 3D animation work since I’m a VFX artist, I was hoping the laptop also had a sleek design and I am willing to compromise a little performance for a more atheistically pleasing look. I am a victim of capitalism so the closer in design to a MacBook the better BUT the goal overall is just a generally sleek and somewhat power and sustainable laptop. Thank you. ",

Preferably new with local warranty support.\n\nAny recommendations or feedback would be highly appreciated.\n\n\\------------------\n\n# Back Story\n\nAfter a long while, I have finally decided to upgrade my laptop, but the current market dynamics is too confusing for me right now esp. between currency hit, price differences, open-box deals, and Masked/refurbished options, it has been difficult to decide on a laptop that truly fits my needs. I would really appreciate some input from the community.\n\n# Current Setup\n\nI’m currently using an HP ProBook 450 G5 (8th Gen). It has served me well, but it’s beginning to show its age, especially under heavier workloads.\n\n# Requirements\n\nCore Specifications\n\nCondition: Brand new preferred  \nCPU: Intel i7 (H-series or equivalent or better)  \nRAM: 24 GB (16 GB minimum with expansion slot - no soldered ones)  \nStorage - (Must be SSD + HDD option)\n\n* SSD 512 GB for OS (second slot for future expansion is a plus)\n* HDD SATA 1 TB (2.5” inch)\n\nDisplay: At least IPS with decent color accuracy & brightness  \nGPU: Nvidia RTX Ada series or something slightly stronger for rendering, encoding/decoding performance. I can work with gaming series but no older than 4000 series.  \n  \nPorts and Connectivity\n\n* Multiple USB A/B/C 2.0/3.0 ports for accessories (mouse, external drives, cooling stand)\n* 3.5 mm audio jack\n* VGA/HDMI port for external display\n* RJ45 LAN port\n* Wi-Fi 4/5 GHz support\n\nKeyboard and Build\n\n* Full-size backlit keyboard (numpad preferred)\n* Rigid build with minimal flex or hinge wobble. Weight isnt an issue.\n* Easy to open for cleaning or upgrades\n* Local parts availability for future maintenance\n\n# Usage Pattern\n\n* My workload involves heavy office use with constant multitasking, often running numerous browser tabs alongside background tools for downloading and file-syncing. Current system starts to lag with ram & cpu reaching max capacity before apps start crashing.\n* I do not play games on the laptop as I have a ps5 pro for that - so I dont require top end latest GPU.\n\n# Not Considering\n\n* MacBooks, due to hardware/software compatibility issues with some custom tools I use.\n* Touchscreen, 2-in-1, tablets, flipbooks or hand-held devices\n* Desktops, as I often work from multiple client offices and need portability\n\n# Current Thoughts\n\n* I’ve been considering Lenovo ThinkPad T or P Series, but many models seem to use TFT panels by default. \n* HP Victus models have good specifications but poor reviews regarding build quality, screen wobble, and keyboard flex. \n* I’m also uncertain about Intel versus Ryzen options and would appreciate insights on that. \n* My goal is to move to at least an IPS panel, since my current laptop has a TFT. OLED would be ideal, but likely beyond budget.\n\n# Budget: \n\nAround 300,000 PKR\n\n# Important Points\n\n* Models that offer the best balance of performance, portability, display & build quality\n* I would prefer numpad on keyboard but if laptop model is worth it then I can compromise as a trade off.\n\nI know I might be asking for a lot, but any advice or recommendations would really help. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to share their thoughts.",

    "selftext": "The original battery (model C31N1411, see photo) in my Asus UX305FA (very old ZenBook) is down to about 56% capacity but otherwise fine (no bulges, etc.), so I bought an after-market replacement from an eBay seller. When I tried to fit it into the laptop, I found the screw holes in the battery's plastic frame did not align with the holes and alignment pins in the chassis. Now I wonder, even if I enlarge some of the holes in the plastic frame to allow it to fit, is the battery even safe to use? Is there a risk of fire, shorting, etc. since it is obviously not OEM? The replacement battery is labeled with the same model number  and power specs as the original battery (see photo), but it lacks the serial number label and a couple of square metal panels on the original. I also think that an OEM battery might be so old now (almost 10 years) as to fail to hold a charge. Any opinions?\n\n[Original Battery](https://preview.redd.it/3y5kficchqwf1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6faae7e3c0938f57d4d890191a2f24084268032)\n\n[Replacement battery](https://preview.redd.it/rujz2h2tfqwf1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=566339e40549ecff524cb6ab167b135ee51c0506)\n\n",

GOOD build quality, I want this as a fairly portable laptop so I do not want it to break just from daily use. Also two slots for a 2.5' HDD + M.2/SATA SSD configuration. I don't care about built-in storage / ram capacity as I will just swap those myself if needed.\n\nOptionally, some USB-C ports and also USB-C PD charging, or at least USB3. I don't care for other ports like Ethernet, HDMI, standard USB, card readers, or whatever else laptops have on them. I pretty much have more than enough USB-C adapters for any use.\n\nWhy so specific? I need it for a triple (yes, triple) boot between windows + hackintosh + linux. Not too fussed about hackintosh/linux support on certain things like sound or networking so literally anything that is light AND has any sort of CPU between a 6th-10th gen would do fine.  Also, no budget, but cheaper is better obviously.\n\nAlso, I do NOT care about exterior build quality, scratchability, or all of that kinda fuss tied to cleanliness. Its main environment will be in pretty rough places by default, so it's going to get (extermally) damaged with a lot of blemishes.\n\nThank you!",

The problem with the laptop is that the screen is too washed out and it’s not good to the eyes to use it for more than 30-45 minutes as my eyes start to hurt. \n\nI am looking for a laptop that could develop web applications, desktop applications and xplane plugins(for this I will need a good GPU to open the simulator and run it at 30fps minimum). I do not plan to do any gaming on the laptop, only running VMs, some Emulators maybe and coding/testing for XPlane.\n\nI have had my eyes on a refurbed Macbook M1 Pro, XPlane runs on MacOS and it’s well optimized for that. I’ve been looking for Dell Inspirons, Lenovo Thinkpads and other random brand laptops as well. I’ve seen the Macbooks have very good battery life, but the Thinkpads and Ispirons have great prices. An M1 Pro refurbed mac costs 550€ for context.\n\nI have had my eyes on this laptop:\n\nhttps://amzn.eu/d/elNLsnQ\n\nRyzen 9 6900HX, 32GB DDR5 Ram and 1TB NVMe all for 555€, and it has a 2560x1600 display!

I noticed that the charger light wasn't glowing so I thought it may have disconnected, but it wasn't that. There was no kow battery warning or anything, it was a completely sudden death. \nGranted, it is a bit older and I have been getting some error messages lately, but the thing was working pretty well overall until then. It was all very sudden, and even though I haven't been able to try another charger I really much doubt it was that since the battery light usually blinks to indicate there's no charge. \nI opened it to see if maybe something got disconnected but everything seemed to be in order, I have fixed it before myself but this time I'm completely dumfounded. \nIs it worth it to take it to a repair shop or should I just get some used one for my basic needs?",

    "selftext": "I had to do a lot of disassembly to get to a part that needed replacement on a HP ProBook 6870b, when this happened. One side is completely shattered, and the other is looking better but still has some cracks (second image). Now I need one more part. I need to replace the top cover. They are cheap for a laptop this old, if you can find one.\n\nBut instead of replacing the top cover, I thought about trying some epoxy glue from JB Weld or another brand. As you can see, I still have some bits of plastic, and I'm saving those to try and put them back in their original location (filler material). Ideally, I think it would be best to use something that not only fuses two pieces of plastic together but also adds new material to fill the gaps, that can be shaped into right size later on. I saw that JB Weld has something like that.\n\nI have never used JB Weld products before, or done this kind of repair before, or broken something like this before. So this is all unknown to me. I don't even have JB Weld where I live, and no one has even heard of this brand, but I will order it online.\n\nHas anyone in this sub done this repair (attempt) before? With success? Or failed it? I saw [one post](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/e7blms/what_could_i_use_to_glue_this_hinge_back_onto_the/) from 6 years ago, where someone linked to a YouTube video where some guy from India did it. But that was the end of the discussion. It was more important apparently for the guy that replied with the link what laptop brand OP had, so he could avoid it. It turned out he had the same brand! LOLZ! I have the same brand! It's a HP. So what? Any brand laptop can brake at the hinges if you don't pay attention and do it wrong. I learned my lesson.\n\nActually, this is a very serviceable laptop, with socketed CPU, the old school era where you could do all kinds of service on it. But the service manual for it is trash! Lots of inaccuracies and missing info, like having to remove 2 PH1 screws underneath the keyboard to release the bottom cover, and it doesn't emphasize that you should remove the 4 T8 screws at the back last! I learned this the hard way.",

    "selftext": "Good morning, people. I have decided I want a convertible laptop for school and studying. To be specific, the HP OmniBook Ultra 14 flip is my pick. Now, this laptop will have to hold on for quite some time from the time I'll buy it. I will try to treat it well, but things happen, and I am scared that something annoying for me will happen to it, especially around the screen area. So, do I try to get my hands on a screen protector for the display, or just pray nothing happens to it?",

Apart from doing uni work, some light gaming is appreciated. \n\nHowever, im not sure if the cpu upgrade is worth the price hopefully anyone who has more insight can help as there is no information about 225h only 255h's performance. Lastly, a not so important question is the 14inch option the better choice or its just personal preference?\n\n\n\nThanks for reading.",

    "selftext": "TL;DR\nI have a HP Folio 13 2000 with a basic 13.3\" TN LCD display with a resolution of 1366x768, and I am wanting to swap the panel with an IPS LCD screen. I am wanting to know how I can tell if a panel is going to be compatible. And also if I would be able to get a screen that has a higher resolution, and use that in the laptop without any trouble.\n\n\nBasic information about me to explain my writing:\n\n● My special interest is technology particularly the hardware (especially retro and older and vintage technology), but I am also really interested in many other things as well.\n\n● I can easily have short(ish) side tangents.\n\n● I am often very to the point and as a result sometime might sound like a chat bot (yes this has happened to me before)\n\n● I also have a really strong passion for reducing ewaste and giving things a new home, I am working with a group called the Lions Club to bring computers to families and especially children who are in financially struggling for free. We are talking complete setups; desktop, mouse, keyboard, screen, installed and setup OS, cables. And hopefully soon this will include laptops, all of the items are refurbished and can come from business or even ewaste if it is in good enough condition, and I am able to work with stuff from the core 2 duo era onwards.\n\n● I am self taught in a lot of the skills that I have, and even though I am 22, I have done a lot of work with hardware stuff for years almost 8 years now, and have been able to demonstrate knowledge and skill that people have said are well beyond my year especially when it comes to my abilities, so don't underestimate me with what I am able to understand, am willing to try, and even what I can achieve. (I am not trying to boast or anything, I am just trying to let people know that I am am likely able to understand quite a lot so you don't need to worry too much about me not understanding something.)\n\n\n\nNow that you know a bit more about me, here is what the post is about:\n\nSo for the basic run down of the situation I am in right now. I have some older laptops with one being a HP Folio 13 2000 that I have decided to turn into my Linux an other OSs laptop, and it has a single finger lid opening, and this thing is really well used, but not worn (as in it is clear the laptop was used well previously, but wasn't abused), I only wish it came with a 1600x900 IPS LCD screen, but 1366x768 is still a pretty good resolution for what I need (I sometimes feel like I might be a bit of an oddity in the fact that I really like 4:3/5:4 aspect ratios and my favourite resolution is 1280x1024), but I am planning on upgrading the screen to an IPS LCD screen since it is just a basic TN LCD screen, and the viewing angles are absolutely abysmal. I am also wondering if I would be able to get a better resolution for it as well without any trouble?\n\nDoes anyone know how I can tell if a panel will be compatible with the laptop? It is 13.3\" and has a 40 pin connector.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any help with this.",

So, I’ve decided to get a new device as a whole. if anyone has any recommendations that would be nice! I’m going for laptop that can handle light editing and 3D animation work since I’m a VFX artist, I was hoping the laptop also had a sleek design and I am willing to compromise a little performance for a more atheistically pleasing look. I am a victim of capitalism so the closer in design to a MacBook the better BUT the goal overall is just a generally sleek and somewhat power and sustainable laptop. Thank you. ",

    "selftext": "My laptop has recently started to make very quiet crackling noises near the battery of my Lenovo X13 Yoga (1 year 3 months old).\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/CIhYtGQ](https://imgur.com/a/CIhYtGQ) The area at which the noise comes from is here.\n\nIt doesn't sound like it's coming from the fan as the fan noise clearly comes from a different area of my laptop. I suspect it's the battery because the crackling comes from around the area where there is a vent for the battery at the back of my laptop.\n\nWhen I close my laptop or shut it down, the crackling stops even if the fans continue running. Additionally, the crackling appears to stop when my laptop is very cold (I could be wrong).\n\nMy laptop gets quite hot (\\~90 C) when I have multiple apps and browser tabs open. Has anyone experienced this issue? My battery warranty unfortunately expired 3 months ago but I would be willing to purchase a new one.",

Preferably new with local warranty support.\n\nAny recommendations or feedback would be highly appreciated.\n\n\\------------------\n\n# Back Story\n\nAfter a long while, I have finally decided to upgrade my laptop, but the current market dynamics is too confusing for me right now esp. between currency hit, price differences, open-box deals, and Masked/refurbished options, it has been difficult to decide on a laptop that truly fits my needs. I would really appreciate some input from the community.\n\n# Current Setup\n\nI’m currently using an HP ProBook 450 G5 (8th Gen). It has served me well, but it’s beginning to show its age, especially under heavier workloads.\n\n# Requirements\n\nCore Specifications\n\nCondition: Brand new preferred  \nCPU: Intel i7 (H-series or equivalent or better)  \nRAM: 24 GB (16 GB minimum with expansion slot - no soldered ones)  \nStorage - (Must be SSD + HDD option)\n\n* SSD 512 GB for OS (second slot for future expansion is a plus)\n* HDD SATA 1 TB (2.5” inch)\n\nDisplay: At least IPS with decent color accuracy & brightness  \nGPU: Nvidia RTX Ada series or something slightly stronger for rendering, encoding/decoding performance. I can work with gaming series but no older than 4000 series.  \n  \nPorts and Connectivity\n\n* Multiple USB A/B/C 2.0/3.0 ports for accessories (mouse, external drives, cooling stand)\n* 3.5 mm audio jack\n* VGA/HDMI port for external display\n* RJ45 LAN port\n* Wi-Fi 4/5 GHz support\n\nKeyboard and Build\n\n* Full-size backlit keyboard (numpad preferred)\n* Rigid build with minimal flex or hinge wobble. Weight isnt an issue.\n* Easy to open for cleaning or upgrades\n* Local parts availability for future maintenance\n\n# Usage Pattern\n\n* My workload involves heavy office use with constant multitasking, often running numerous browser tabs alongside background tools for downloading and file-syncing. Current system starts to lag with ram & cpu reaching max capacity before apps start crashing.\n* I do not play games on the laptop as I have a ps5 pro for that - so I dont require top end latest GPU.\n\n# Not Considering\n\n* MacBooks, due to hardware/software compatibility issues with some custom tools I use.\n* Touchscreen, 2-in-1, tablets, flipbooks or hand-held devices\n* Desktops, as I often work from multiple client offices and need portability\n\n# Current Thoughts\n\n* I’ve been considering Lenovo ThinkPad T or P Series, but many models seem to use TFT panels by default. \n* HP Victus models have good specifications but poor reviews regarding build quality, screen wobble, and keyboard flex. \n* I’m also uncertain about Intel versus Ryzen options and would appreciate insights on that. \n* My goal is to move to at least an IPS panel, since my current laptop has a TFT. OLED would be ideal, but likely beyond budget.\n\n# Budget: \n\nAround 300,000 PKR\n\n# Important Points\n\n* Models that offer the best balance of performance, portability, display & build quality\n* I would prefer numpad on keyboard but if laptop model is worth it then I can compromise as a trade off.\n\nI know I might be asking for a lot, but any advice or recommendations would really help. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to share their thoughts.",

    "selftext": "The original battery (model C31N1411, see photo) in my Asus UX305FA (very old ZenBook) is down to about 56% capacity but otherwise fine (no bulges, etc.), so I bought an after-market replacement from an eBay seller. When I tried to fit it into the laptop, I found the screw holes in the battery's plastic frame did not align with the holes and alignment pins in the chassis. Now I wonder, even if I enlarge some of the holes in the plastic frame to allow it to fit, is the battery even safe to use? Is there a risk of fire, shorting, etc. since it is obviously not OEM? The replacement battery is labeled with the same model number  and power specs as the original battery (see photo), but it lacks the serial number label and a couple of square metal panels on the original. I also think that an OEM battery might be so old now (almost 10 years) as to fail to hold a charge. Any opinions?\n\n[Original Battery](https://preview.redd.it/3y5kficchqwf1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6faae7e3c0938f57d4d890191a2f24084268032)\n\n[Replacement battery](https://preview.redd.it/rujz2h2tfqwf1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=566339e40549ecff524cb6ab167b135ee51c0506)\n\n",

I am wanting to know how I can tell if a panel is going to be compatible. And also if I would be able to get a screen that has a higher resolution, and use that in the laptop without any trouble.\n\n\nBasic information about me to explain my writing:\n\n● My special interest is technology particularly the hardware (especially retro and older and vintage technology), but I am also really interested in many other things as well.\n\n● I can easily have short(ish) side tangents.\n\n● I am often very to the point and as a result sometime might sound like a chat bot (yes this has happened to me before)\n\n● I also have a really strong passion for reducing ewaste and giving things a new home, I am working with a group called the Lions Club to bring computers to families and especially children who are in financially struggling for free. We are talking complete setups; desktop, mouse, keyboard, screen, installed and setup OS, cables. And hopefully soon this will include laptops, all of the items are refurbished and can come from business or even ewaste if it is in good enough condition, and I am able to work with stuff from the core 2 duo era onwards.\n\n● I am self taught in a lot of the skills that I have, and even though I am 22, I have done a lot of work with hardware stuff for years almost 8 years now, and have been able to demonstrate knowledge and skill that people have said are well beyond my year especially when it comes to my abilities, so don't underestimate me with what I am able to understand, am willing to try, and even what I can achieve. (I am not trying to boast or anything, I am just trying to let people know that I am am likely able to understand quite a lot so you don't need to worry too much about me not understanding something.)\n\n\n\nNow that you know a bit more about me, here is what the post is about:\n\nSo for the basic run down of the situation I am in right now. I have some older laptops with one being a HP Folio 13 2000 that I have decided to turn into my Linux an other OSs laptop, and it has a single finger lid opening, and this thing is really well used, but not worn (as in it is clear the laptop was used well previously, but wasn't abused), I only wish it came with a 1600x900 IPS LCD screen, but 1366x768 is still a pretty good resolution for what I need (I sometimes feel like I might be a bit of an oddity in the fact that I really like 4:3/5:4 aspect ratios and my favourite resolution is 1280x1024), but I am planning on upgrading the screen to an IPS LCD screen since it is just a basic TN LCD screen, and the viewing angles are absolutely abysmal. I am also wondering if I would be able to get a better resolution for it as well without any trouble?\n\nDoes anyone know how I can tell if a panel will be compatible with the laptop? It is 13.3\" and has a 40 pin connector.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any help with this.",

It's gotta be decent enough to last 3-4 years and run on Windows. Budget is roughly 1k CAD. I know it sounds easy enough, but here's the catch; she's got weird ass requirements and won't budge:\n\nIt must plug on the right side, have speakers on the top part (where the keyboard is) and have a backlit keyboard. Those are deal breakers. \n\nTouchscreen is preferred but not mandatory.\n\nI'm at my wit's end, so I hope you find a model that works xD thanks y'all",

So, I’ve decided to get a new device as a whole. if anyone has any recommendations that would be nice! I’m going for laptop that can handle light editing and 3D animation work since I’m a VFX artist, I was hoping the laptop also had a sleek design and I am willing to compromise a little performance for a more atheistically pleasing look. I am a victim of capitalism so the closer in design to a MacBook the better BUT the goal overall is just a generally sleek and somewhat power and sustainable laptop. Thank you. ",

I suspect it's the battery because the crackling comes from around the area where there is a vent for the battery at the back of my laptop.\n\nWhen I close my laptop or shut it down, the crackling stops even if the fans continue running. Additionally, the crackling appears to stop when my laptop is very cold (I could be wrong).\n\nMy laptop gets quite hot (\\~90 C) when I have multiple apps and browser tabs open. Has anyone experienced this issue? My battery warranty unfortunately expired 3 months ago but I would be willing to purchase a new one.",

Might need to duck into genAI for my next gig, but it's not my top priority. Assume I just need to run everything. \n\nAlso my current plan is to keep my Radeon RX 6600 and upgrade that next year. Gaming performance doesn't matter to me right now, as long as I can run my games then ugly is fine. Will this hurt work performance? The software I saw that might be bottlenecked by the gpu is C4d and DaVinci Resolve, but that's fine for the near future. (I find GPU rendering in Maya always causes problems, I use CPU for most scenes.)\n\nThanks for your help!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently moved to a new place for a new job and I’m still setting up my apartment. One of the first things I want to get is a monitor that can work well for both productivity and gaming.\n\nHere’s my setup and what I’m looking for:\n\n* I have two laptops:\n   * A Legion 5 Pro (2021) gaming laptop (slightly old, but I mostly play FIFA on it; runs fine on low settings).\n   * A work laptop that I’ll use 8-9 hours a day for coding, documentation, and meetings.\n* I want a monitor that I can easily switch between both laptops (for example, one on HDMI, one on USB-C or DisplayPort).\n* I also plan to buy a PS5 soon, so I’d love a monitor that would be great for consoles too.\n\nI’m looking for something in the 27\"-32\" range. I’ll mostly use it for work during the day and for gaming/content (movies, YouTube, etc.) after hours. Also, I don't play competitive games anymore.\n\nI was eyeing some OLED models but I’m a bit concerned about burn-in since the monitor will be on for long workdays. If OLED isn’t ideal for my use case, I’m open to high-quality IPS or VA panels too.\n\n**Budget:** Having a hard deciding this. On one hand, I do not want to spend much but on the other, I feel like it's a one-time investment for a long time and it does boost productivity too. Also, having experienced some high-end QLED TVs before, I am not easily impressed by displays.\n\nWould love recommendations or personal experiences with monitors that fit this mix of work + gaming + console use.\n\n**TL;DR: my main questions:**\n\n1. What panel type should I go for (OLED vs IPS vs VA)?\n2. Do OLED panels still have noticeable burn-in risk in 2025 for all-day work use?\n3. What resolution makes the most sense, is 4K worth it, or is QHD good enough?\n4. If I had to trade off quality to save money, is it better to go for QHD on a better panel or 4K on a worse one?\n5. Should I consider a dual-monitor setup, one for gaming/content and a cheaper one for static work tasks?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m working on building my first custom gaming PC after years of using a prebuilt that’s starting to slow down. I’m aiming for a **budget of around $2,000**, targeting **high settings at 1440p / 144 Hz**.\n\nThis build will mainly be for gaming (Rust, Escape from Tarkov, Baldur’s Gate 3, etc.), but I also plan to use it occasionally for **engineering software** like CAD and simulation (FEA/CFD).\n\nI was originally considering the RTX 4070 Ti Super, but aftermarket prices are ridiculous, so I’m now leaning toward the **RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB**. I’ve done my due diligence researching parts and compatibility, but I’d really appreciate any **constructive criticism or optimization suggestions** before finalizing the build.

Will the faster clock speed give an improvement in 0.1% lows or just help boost avg fps higher? I have most of my build already with a 9070xt, and I play mostly cpu bound games, so I was wondering if I should wait until at least the upcoming amd financial analyst day to see if any news about this comes out. And if it turns out to be true would the performance boost be substantial enough to be worth the extra wait/extra cost.",

However, when I go to reboot I now have two diagnostic LEDs illuminated (red-CPU is not detected or fail, and yellow-DRAM is not detected or fail).  I also cannot reach the BIOS anymore, despite several more reboots.  At some point, I notice that the fans have returned to their stock 50% setting.\n\nI next attempted to reset the BIOS by pressing the Clear CMOS button on the rear of the case.  This powered down the fans, and next reboot only the yellow LED is illuminated.  Several more reboot haven't changed anything so I am hoping for some advice on what else I can try here.\n\nedit: I turned it on again and now the red LED is back as well.",

    "title": "PC case suited for pets (cats)",
    "selftext": "Heya, all!\n\nA friend of mine is helping me with my build and we've kinda finalized the parts for the PC (my first).\n\nI'll list the parts below. The final thing is the case. I am not one to care for aesthetics, but I do have two cats. The case will be on the desk, and the cats are not forbidden from walking around the desk, so I'm assuming they'll be around the case. (cat tax in comments). So my question here would be: What case would you recommend that is best suited to deal with cat hair and at the same time ensure good aiflow and, if possible, low noise. \n\n\n\nMotherboard: Asus TUF Gaming B850 (most likely BTF)\nCPU: Ryzen 7 9800X3D\nVideo: Asus tuf 9070XT\nRam: 2x32G (Most probably G.Skill Trident Z5 F5-6000J2836G32GX2-TR5S)\nPower: Seasonic Focus GX ATX 3 (2024) GX-1000 1000W ATX 3.1 FOCUS-GX-1000-V4\n\nFor the case, I've been recommended the Be quiet! Light base 600 LX White BGW68, together with the be quiet! light loop 360mm BW023\n\n\n\nHere is the question I've got:\n\n1. Do you reckon that case would be suited for the presence of two cats? If not, what would you recommend? Any accessories? \n\n2. If you think something can be improved in the picked parts - feel free to suggest, but that's not the main goal of this post\n\n\nThanks all!\n\n\nEdit:\n\nPurpose: Gaming. Some UE5 games, otherwise DOTA, Paradox games.\n\nMain reason for 9800 is longevity and not needing to touch it for a while.\n\nAs for the ram: I'm seeing current prices around  150EUR/175USD for 2x16 around ~300-350EUR/350-400USD for 2x32. Honestly... I don't have a good enough reason to jump the gun to 64 other than \"I'd rather have it and eventually need it rather than need it and not have it\". My current daily driver is a 2014 Lenovo y50-70 - the longer I can carry this hardware the better. Plus, better resale value further down the road.",

Mostly gameplay mods, maybe minimal graphics mods. I’ll also be doing simple video editing in DaVinci Resolve, possibly with hour-long videos but nothing heavy. \n\n\nI'm unsure of how to make the link show prices and parts unfortunately. \n\n\nI’m mainly going for an all-black, no-RGB build with good airflow and solid performance for the price.

However, I did choose the CPU and AM5 chipset in mind in case the 9070 XT gets a price cut or another GPU comes the way—then I will consider changing my monitor.\n\nBut I'm still a bit nervous even though I had a budget to stick to and I figured this combo would fit my needs. It doesn't help where I live prices are hijacked up and sales far between.\n\nI engage both with AAA and competitive games. I don't always gravitate towards AAA though, usually it's mostly Resident Evil and nowadays Silent Hill with the current revival. Thinking of playing Dying Light The Beast as well, which I don't mind lowering some settings for. \n\nBut outside the shiny new rare AAA, it's mostly older games and CPU intensive ones... but this GPU is what's making me nervous as an old \"everything high end\" user lol.\n\nAnyway, let's cut to the chase. **Please tell me, do you have a rig with this set up?** Are you happy with it or not?",

    "selftext": "I'm trying to build a PC on a relatively low-ish budget ($750 maximum, and I really don't even want to go that high). I would like to be able to play Spider-Man games, Overwatch, *maybe* Ghost of Tsushima if I'm lucky (but not really a required benchmark). Someone is offering a 6800XT for $160, and says that it has to be underclocked slightly due to crashes. Is this a bad use of my money??",

    "selftext": "First time building a PC and getting confused on the pros vs cons of certain motherboards and which are better than others. I have a general idea of what I want, but nothing set in stone. I’ve found a MSI MAG X670E tomahawk, Asus TUF X870-plus, and MSI B850 tomahawk for about the same price on Facebook marketplace. All are new open box. Missed an opportunity on a X870E aorus elite for $200 unfortunately already. What would be the best options to pair with a Ryzen 7 7800X3D? Going to be used for gaming mostly and light computer work. Appreciate any help or additional tips in advance. \nAlso not opposed to suggestions of any other motherboards not listed. These are just the ones I found decent deals on. ",

    "selftext": "Recently built a pc on budget. Went with an i5-14600K paired up with an RTX5060Ti 16gb. But since I was trying to stay on my budget as much as I could I had to buy a cheap mobo. Picked up a Gigabyte H610M-K DDR4 Rev 2.0 and it seems that this was such a newbie move and trust me I thought I was just the opposite till now. Tried running few on ultra with DLSS(BF2042, Spider Man 2, Cyberpunk 2077) and they ran pretty much above my expectations. But each game had one issue in common, they had regular hiccups every 2 minutes. Installed HWinfo and Riva Tuner to look into temps and everything seemed fine CPU was below 60C and GPU was below 70C at any time under heavy load (including the 3 games given above). But at the same time, same load, the Vcore VR was always above 100C and every time it goes above 105 it stutters so bad and CPU clocks go down to 0.80Ghz. So I guess I have to go get a new mobo, but please if you are willing to provide any suggestions for a new mobo please please keep in mind that I am still on a budget and our economy is on the floor.

I’d like some feedback on my current build before I buy anything.\n\nMy goals are to play Skyrim with around 100+ gameplay, graphics, and UI mods at 1440p 60 FPS (no 4K or unlocked FPS mods), play Rainbow Six Siege at 1440p 120 FPS on standard settings, and play modded Minecraft. Mostly gameplay mods, maybe minimal graphics mods. I’ll also be doing simple video editing in DaVinci Resolve, possibly with hour-long videos but nothing heavy. \n\n\nI'm unsure of how to make the link show prices and parts unfortunately. \n\n\nI’m mainly going for an all-black, no-RGB build with good airflow and solid performance for the price. Any feedback on part compatibility, bottlenecks, or better value alternatives would be appreciated. My budget is about 1000$-1300$, but maybe just maybe i'd be willing to go past it a bit.\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/dMLtv4)",

Gaming performance doesn't matter to me right now, as long as I can run my games then ugly is fine. Will this hurt work performance? The software I saw that might be bottlenecked by the gpu is C4d and DaVinci Resolve, but that's fine for the near future.

However, I did choose the CPU and AM5 chipset in mind in case the 9070 XT gets a price cut or another GPU comes the way—then I will consider changing my monitor.\n\nBut I'm still a bit nervous even though I had a budget to stick to and I figured this combo would fit my needs.

    "title": "Upgrading my AM4 system and skipping AM5?",
    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nThanks to your feedback regarding my current situation, I’ve got a much better understanding of my dilemma.\n\nSomeone suggested that it might be worth getting an entirely new system and I don’t doubt that. It’s just not within my possibilities right now though.\n\nIn my eyes, I’ve got these options:\n\n1. Save up for a new AM5 system\n2. Max out my AM4 system with a 5800XT or 5800X3D and a matching GPU\n\n2.1. Then build an AM5 system later\n\n3. Go with option 2, but instead build a new AM6 system in around 3–4 years\n\nIf I spend around **500–700 €** on a new CPU and GPU now (that my PSU can handle), I’ll have more fun for a couple of years. Then there’s a good chance I can upgrade straight to an AM6 system later, instead of “wasting” money I don’t really have on an expensive AM5 setup that might lead to the same situation again in a few years.\n\nOf course, I know that with tech, this will always be the game - and that’s just how things are. Still, I’d love to hear different opinions on my plan.\n\nI’ve got an **HP Omen 32c (2560×1440, 165 Hz)** monitor, and right now (According to the steam overlay) I’m getting around **80–100 FPS** without frame generation or anything like that, on **auto low (everything low)** settings.  \nMy goal would be a smoother experience with higher settings; ideally **120 + FPS on mid–high settings at 1440p**.\n\nMy idea is that I could enjoy a noticeably better experience now and for upcoming games, until I’m in a better financial situation. This way, I’m making the most out of my current setup and by skipping AM5, I’d actually turn my dilemma into a reasonable long-term plan.  \nIs there anything that speaks against this idea?\n\n**For reference, my specs:**\n\n* **Mainboard:** MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 3700X\n* **GPU:** 8 GB Gainward GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER Phantom GS\n* **RAM:** 32 GB G.Skill DDR4-3200\n* **PSU:** 550 W be quiet! Straight Power 11 Modular 80+ Gold\n* **Case:** be quiet! Dark Base 700\n* **Cooling:** Corsair Hydro Series H100i Platinum + be quiet! Silent Wings 3 PWM",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently moved to a new place for a new job and I’m still setting up my apartment. One of the first things I want to get is a monitor that can work well for both productivity and gaming.\n\nHere’s my setup and what I’m looking for:\n\n* I have two laptops:\n   * A Legion 5 Pro (2021) gaming laptop (slightly old, but I mostly play FIFA on it; runs fine on low settings).\n   * A work laptop that I’ll use 8-9 hours a day for coding, documentation, and meetings.\n* I want a monitor that I can easily switch between both laptops (for example, one on HDMI, one on USB-C or DisplayPort).\n* I also plan to buy a PS5 soon, so I’d love a monitor that would be great for consoles too.\n\nI’m looking for something in the 27\"-32\" range. I’ll mostly use it for work during the day and for gaming/content (movies, YouTube, etc.) after hours. Also, I don't play competitive games anymore.\n\nI was eyeing some OLED models but I’m a bit concerned about burn-in since the monitor will be on for long workdays. If OLED isn’t ideal for my use case, I’m open to high-quality IPS or VA panels too.\n\n**Budget:** Having a hard deciding this. On one hand, I do not want to spend much but on the other, I feel like it's a one-time investment for a long time and it does boost productivity too. Also, having experienced some high-end QLED TVs before, I am not easily impressed by displays.\n\nWould love recommendations or personal experiences with monitors that fit this mix of work + gaming + console use.\n\n**TL;DR: my main questions:**\n\n1. What panel type should I go for (OLED vs IPS vs VA)?\n2. Do OLED panels still have noticeable burn-in risk in 2025 for all-day work use?\n3. What resolution makes the most sense, is 4K worth it, or is QHD good enough?\n4. If I had to trade off quality to save money, is it better to go for QHD on a better panel or 4K on a worse one?\n5. Should I consider a dual-monitor setup, one for gaming/content and a cheaper one for static work tasks?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Recently built a pc on budget. Went with an i5-14600K paired up with an RTX5060Ti 16gb. But since I was trying to stay on my budget as much as I could I had to buy a cheap mobo. Picked up a Gigabyte H610M-K DDR4 Rev 2.0 and it seems that this was such a newbie move and trust me I thought I was just the opposite till now. Tried running few on ultra with DLSS(BF2042, Spider Man 2, Cyberpunk 2077) and they ran pretty much above my expectations. But each game had one issue in common, they had regular hiccups every 2 minutes. Installed HWinfo and Riva Tuner to look into temps and everything seemed fine CPU was below 60C and GPU was below 70C at any time under heavy load (including the 3 games given above). But at the same time, same load, the Vcore VR was always above 100C and every time it goes above 105 it stutters so bad and CPU clocks go down to 0.80Ghz. So I guess I have to go get a new mobo, but please if you are willing to provide any suggestions for a new mobo please please keep in mind that I am still on a budget and our economy is on the floor.

To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

    "selftext": "Okay, yes, I'm a fan of VTM: Bloodlines. The visuals, the music, the story with all the hidden stuff, the voice acting... Jeanette and Therese, the haunted house quest, damn it was good.\nThis feeling to be a monster, powerful, free, cover by vice decafance and sensuality..and humour. \n\nSo yeah, I knew VTM: Bloodlines 2 wouldn’t be great but a part of be wish they gat at least the atmosphere, the \" cool\" factor! ...well They dint and it turned out to be a disappointment. I was ready to play something less open-world, more action-driven, without the full open world and multi-gameplay style of the first.\n\nWhen I started the game, I had a little bit of hope... until they showed me the skill sheet and I realized how simple it was. I became... sad.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, it just doesn’t have a soul. It’s boring. The voice acting for every character, including the main one, is dull and lifeless, with no energy or personality. It lacks the sensuality, the vice, the dirtiness that made the first game unforgettable. The game feels too clean, like the studio didn’t want to take any risks. The female Nomad is boring as hell. Fabian the Malkavian is slightly less boring, but still not entertaining. And he’s a freaking Malkavian!\n\nThe controls are stiff, the combat is dull (I chose Tremere, maybe that was a mistake), and the game is full of bugs. The music... well, it’s somewhere? But when it plays, it completely lacks that epic gothic techno vibe from the first game.\n\nThat said, I do like the graphic style. It looks good. There’s something there, something that could make a great game if they knew what to do with it.\n\nI really hope this isn’t the last game of the series. I want a third one, something that lets them finally make a good game. I hope they listen to the community’s feedback and run with it.\n",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

It’s pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound’s coming from. I don’t see any technical reason why we can’t have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response – there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "**Greetings, everyone!**\n\nOur upcoming project - a medieval RPG **Legacy of Valor** \\- is on Kickstarter, and we've already surpassed our first stretch goal.\n\nBut first, I'd like to introduce you to the game itself.\n\n**Legacy of Valor** is a medieval RPG that blends **castle building**, **territory management**, **large-scale battles**, and a **story-driven narrative** into one immersive experience. In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Husák! 😊), but soon, **thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his **passion, enthusiasm, and desire** are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Husák himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to **expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile – and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point, **we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that **Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*“Hey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors — If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you’re gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step — launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign — just like old times — and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let’s rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let’s build that castle from the ground up — together.”*\n\nWe can’t express how much this means to us. **Warhorse Studios inspired us** \\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives **Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let’s carry this legacy forward. **Together!**\n\nKickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit: [r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX: [https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website: [https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

    "selftext": "To be more specific, Massive Entertainment put out a social media statement implying that they're encouraging staff to voluntarily leave the company/lay themselves off with benefits/company assistance:\n\n\"As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games. To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

Developing for VR has definitely been a different experience compared to normal game development .. challenging at times if I have to be honest.   \n  \nI’ve learned a lot along the way and willing to learn more especially with the help and feedback from the community! In this game you have to get to your objectives by blowing your trench whistle but the catch is the enemies can hear your whistle too, footsteps on wooden floor (if they squeek), dropping bottles or hitting them, etc. Thanks for checking it out!

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

    "title": "toggleHDR util for Windows",
    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

Developing for VR has definitely been a different experience compared to normal game development .. challenging at times if I have to be honest.   \n  \nI’ve learned a lot along the way and willing to learn more especially with the help and feedback from the community! In this game you have to get to your objectives by blowing your trench whistle but the catch is the enemies can hear your whistle too, footsteps on wooden floor (if they squeek), dropping bottles or hitting them, etc. Thanks for checking it out!

Hence I'm looking to just start over, be that a pre-build or something I put together.\n\nThe reason I am not just trying to figure it all out by myself, is that most articles online talking about powerful PCs, go over their performance in FPS games. And that I am unsure if the specs for FPS games fully translate to good performance in what I intend to play, which is GTNH, Vintage Story, and Satisfactory.\n\nAll in all, what I am asking is:\n1. Should I look for certain specs in my search for  a PC/Hardware to be able to get the best performance in my games?\n2. Does anyone have recommendations for parts/pre-builds, that would fall within a total budget of $1.5-3k Australian?",

On the one hand I would prefer Acer for a bigger screen, more storage and also not less important the fact that it comes with charger and OEM Box, it has almost no scratches, almost new and a little bit less important it ships from Canada (I'm living there).\n\nOn the other hand the Dell as I know usually has a better quality construction, but there's not a lot of storage, it doesn't come with an AC adapter and has some visible scratches, but it's still in pretty good condition. Some more powerful CPU, smaller screen and fingerprint. Comes from the USA, that also means longer delivery but not so important.\n\n\nThe fingerprint part is almost important for me like the webcam (I almost never use notebooks webcams, but it's still nice to have it for the future). \nI don't have a lot of money to spend. But I would like to make a clever choice.\n\nHope for your support, \n\nThanks in advance to everyone who will consider my request.\n\n#Acer photos https://imgur.com/a/ToyICo5\n#Dell photos https://imgur.com/a/UyG8HFy\n  \n  \n#***Remarque***\n`I was trying to check for some Thinkbooks but they're really rare in Canada, especially with the Intel 11th, for 1 month I was monitoring eBay without any chance, usually the price goes to high and USA deals are not reliable for me because of the delivery cost. I got a Dell Precision 3540 before, but I was unable to pay for it. 172 USD but in CAD the full price was like 450CA :(`\n  \n#Another bid and proposition\nhttps://imgur.com/a/MI8eQw4\n  \nI was just trying now to bid for a (good) Lenovo Thinkbook T14 1st Gen with Ryzen 7 pro and Vega 7, but without any chance and it's not the first.\n   \nAs I know it must perform rly close to the i5-1135g7 with iris graphics. But really if you look at the bids there's no chance to have one for that price (140USD is usually my limit for the American market, because of high delivery prices and taxes) so my only option is some Dell or the Acer.\n  \nI also had a good proposition for another Dell Latitude 5420 (1 day to decide) but it has some mods that i don't really understand, you can check them here:\\\nhttps://www.dell.com/support/product-details/en-ca/servicetag/0-ditwdW5NNHZKOVdNQUdqVExDK1VQZz090/overview\n#ST: 26D29C3\n (click on **\"Quick Links\"** and then **\"product specifications\"**)\nI don't know if those mods can in any way be a problem or not.\nI hope someone will be able to help me, 🙏🏼 thx\n\n#Ramarque\n*This one actually has a webcam, but again, there's no fingerprint and only 8gb ram*",

    "selftext": "Hello all, it's lovely to be back.\n\nI've got a little prebuild that I made in the summer of '23 that's been serving me well ever since. During summer of this year, 2025, I had a fun little fiasco where an XFX GPU had overdrawn voltage and fried itself along with damaging a port on my power supply. One replacement card and power supply later, things have been much better.\n\nHowever...\n\nI've been recently encountering an issue wherein upon booting my computer, everything is normal. Things run, ram is successfully overclocked, no issues whatsoever. However, I've noticed two very glaring issues:\n\n1. Rebooting the computer causes the computer to seemingly turn off (i.e. windows shuts down, no more display), but the computer itself will still be on, with the fans still on, speeding up, slowing down, speeding up, etc. The motherboard has a diagnostic display, one of the 8-segment displays, and it displays \"00\" with an orange light. Only fix is to press and hold power button (my case does not have a reset button) to shut it off, after which it turns on just fine.\n\n2. Rebooting into safe mode (In order to install some drivers for a PS2 Eyetoy) causes the safe mode screen to appear but freeze and become inactive. Mouse and keyboard RGB also freezes at this time.\n\nso far I've tried a BiOS update, and a flashback, but messing around with the BiOS in general scares me. Trying to avoid messing around with those.\n\n  \nSystem specs:  \nRam - Trident Z5 Neo RGB 48 gb (2 x 24gb) (F5-5600J4040D24GX2-TZ5NR)  \nCPU - Ryzen 9 7900X3D  \nGPU - XFX Mercury Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Magnetic Air Edition AMD 16 GB GDDR6  \nMotherboard - ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi  \nCase - Fractal North  \nCPU Cooler - Lian Li 140mm AIO  \nPSU - CORSAIR RM1000e (2025) 1000W",

    "title": "Stuck on B360, should I upgrade from i7-8700 to i9-9900",
    "selftext": "Hi guys, so I currently have the following setup: TUF B360-PLUS motherboard, i7-8700 non-K, 2x8GB DDR4-2666, 512GB NVME, and a used 3060ti that I recently upgraded from a 8 year old 1060 6GB. My PC is pretty old, it was built in 2017 as a matter of fact. \n\nI am recently scouring the used market for any potential upgrade, that’s where I got my used 3060ti as the first piece of the upgrade, I’m currently planning to up my ram to 4x8 by adding 2 more sticks of 8GB DDR4 and thinking about a CPU upgrade as well.\n\nI checked and realised that the furthest my current motherboard can go is a 9th gen intel, and I do not really want to upgrade the motherboard, so the “best” possible upgrade I can get for the CPU is an i9-9900, but I am not sure is it worth it. I’ve heard several complaints about the 9900 but none of them were similar to my currently planned build of 9900 on a B360 paired with a 3060ti. A used 9900 on a used market at my place is around 100USD, it’s really tempting but I wanna sort out any potential issues before committing to it. \n\nI’d really appreciate if anyone can help me on this! Thank you!",

    "selftext": "Hello, sorry for this everyone.  As of recent I have been having extremely bad stability issues with my computer.  I started a claim through intel as I fear my CPU may be damaged from the Raptor Lake bug last year.  Looking at it, my CPU seems like there may be some thermal damage between the pins, but not to sure.  On the socket on the MOBO at the bottom it also looks like there could be some damage also but I’m not too sure as this is the first time I’m really working on a (possibly) damaged computer.  Off the rip the issues I’m having are severe instability (games crashing, BSOD, CTD, games/programs locking up requiring a restart to clear), audio cutting out, and also cannot run my ram at the advertised speed. 132GB at 4800 vs 5600(advertised).  My main concern is with Intel sending me a new CPU, I have read online a little bit that this particular MOBO and CPU can be incompatible a little bit and cause issues.  Would you all be able to shed some light on if either one of these appear damaged and/or would it be in my best interest to change the MOBO out for a better one or will it be okay.\n\n\nTLDR: Computer goes crashy crashy with equipment in title.  Not sure if damaged, if so please let me know.  Also please let me know if I need to change MOBO due to possible compatibility issues.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Basically as the title says. I'm looking to upgrade my B450 AORUS M to a new MOBO with AM5 support.\n\nI was looking at buying a new M.2 and really liked the look of the Samsung 990 Pro 2TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 but based on some research I saw that my current mobo wouldn't be able to make full use of the speeds of this M.2 so figured I would grab a new mobo while I'm at it.\n\nMy current PC specs:\n\n\\- AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (Wanting to upgrade later down the line when I can get DDR5 Ram at the same time)\n\n\\- Corsair 64GB (2x32GB) Vengeance LPX (DDR4)\n\n\\- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\n\\- B450 AORUS M\n\n\\- SilverStone 750W Strider 80+ Gold Modular Power Supply (probably not relevant but figured I should list it)\n\nI use this PC for both gaming, 3D Modelling/Rendering, Game Dev, and 3D Data processing. I also remote in to PCs overseas for a studio I work for so having support for decent wifi connection is needed (ethernet isn't really doable where I'm currently living)\n\nCurrently my budget for a mobo is roughly $300AUD, I'm mainly looking for something that is a direct upgrade to my current mobo. Full size ATX would be nice but obviously budget might make that difficult.\n\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated, even if that recommendation is holding off to upgrade my motherboard until I can spend more. However ideally I'd like to grab a new mobo when I get my m.2.",

    "selftext": "Looking for suggestions for my up and coming tri-monitor setup. I primarily play competitive games specifically counter strike (save your hate for another day lol). I’m wanting 3 monitors at 24inches with very little bezel, and I have about a $400 budget. I don’t care about refresh rate for 2 of them but the main monitor has got to be at least 144hz and very low input delay, as that’s what I play on now. My struggle here is finding 2 monitors that are physically identical to the main 144hz (or higher if it’s in the budget) so it all looks clean. Not to mention the tri arm mounts I’m seeing online are quite pricey. PC MasterRace don’t fail me now 🙏🙏\n\n(Backstory for anyone curious as to why I’m seemingly so late to the multiple monitor game) I was rocking 3 throughout Highschool, but after moving multiple times and living in my car for a bit I’ve been using a single monitor for over a year now.",

Not looking to spend $50 a fan (or $3.95 in freedom dollars), but I'm willing to spend the money if i find the right fan. I do have 3 other case fans that will be staying in so I'd rather noise level over performance.\n\n  \nTLDR; I'm after personal recs on quiet, RBG, 140mm case fans.",

This only difference is that its the newer model of the RM850. So get this; I put the new one in my pc and it won't post. Motherboard gets no power and the fan hardly gets any. No display and power button doesn't work. I swap the power supply with the one originally in mine which is the same exact model and make except a couple years older; and my PC will post. The newer RM850 works with my wifes motherboard however which is a Asus M5A97 R2.0. I'm assuming that either A.) The voltage/wattage is just too much for the ASRock A320. B.) Not having 12v rail pin may be the issue since all ATX 3.0 don't have that pin. Those are the only things I can come up with. Would greatly appreciate if anyone could post any tips or hints as to why it could happen. One day I would like to upgrade my motherboard and shouldn't have to upgrade PSU but would like to know just in case for the future. Thank you for any help!",

    "selftext": "Alright, I’ve had my Sapphire RX 5700XT Nitro+ for five years, now entering its sixth.  \nRecently, shadows started glitching—stretching, flickering, spasming across the screen, then snapping back to normal. In *Helldivers 2*, my PC sometimes freezes and goes to a green screen before a hard reset.\n\nI went through all the usual fixes:\n\n* DDU clean driver installs\n* Older driver versions\n* Fresh Windows 11 install\n* Tried Linux (same issue eventually)\n\nI also noticed my GPU was running at PCIe 3.0 x8 instead of x16. Figured it might be dust buildup, so I disassembled everything, cleaned it thoroughly, repasted the CPU, and cleaned the GPU pins with an eraser and 95% ethanol. That fixed the lane issue.\n\nBefore cleaning, OCCT 3D Adaptive threw a ton of errors (300k in 30 seconds) at stock clocks and voltage. I tested again after cleaning and repasting—still the same issue. I tried underclocking to 1950 MHz / 1200 mV—still errored. Now testing 1800 MHz / 1100 mV to confirm whether the GPU die is dying.\n\nThe problem is, both my CPU and GPU are due for replacement, but I graduated three months ago, still can’t find a job in translation (thanks, LLMs), and I’m broke living with my parents.\n\nSo I’m stuck trying to make this card last as long as possible until I can afford an upgrade.  \nAny tips on how to squeeze a bit more life out of a dying 5700XT?",

The problematic one started failing after being powered off for a couple of weeks this summer (maybe after a Windows update?).\n\n**Specs**:  \nRyzen 5700G with Radeon graphics.  \nAsus b550-plus motherboard  \n2x 16gb ddr4 viper ram  \nGtx 3060 zotac 12gb  \n750w power supply  \n2tb ssd m2 nvme  \nOS Windows 10\n\nThe non-working PC gets stuck in an **infinite automatic repair loop** and won’t proceed. I cannot access any **advanced recovery options**, its also impossible to make a **fresh Windows installation using an USB**\n\nHere’s everything that’s already been tried by a professional technician:  \n\\- Removed and swapped RAM sticks  \n\\- Replaced the motherboard  \n\\- Swapped the power supply  \n\\- Cleaned the PC thoroughly  \n\\- Tested the GPU  \n\\- Disconnected all peripherals  \n\\- Tried different monitor and HDMI cables  \n\\- Updated the boot firmware/UEFI  \n\\- Tried to install Linux OS via USB\n\n**Some observations:**  \n\\- The PC can enter a UEFI shell using an EFI USB stick and run commands  \n\\- The UEFI shell recognizes the USB sticks  \n\\- The SSD is visible, and its content can be analyzed  \n\\- The Windows Installing USB stick is correctly created  \n\\- The NVMe drive appears in the device map  \n\\- Despite this, it’s not possible to boot from any USB stick, even a freshly prepared Windows installation, after booting it gets stuck to an automatic repair cycle again  \n\\- the problem started way before the end of Support for Windows 10  \n\\- sadly the twin computers are now 900km afar from eachother so I can't swap pieces easily.\n\n**Additional details:**  \n\\- Both PCs are set to “Other OS” mode in the BIOS, so Secure Boot is already disabled  \n\\- Switching to UEFI/Windows OS mode hasn’t been tested yet  \n\\- The USB sticks freeze even when accessed from the EFI shell  \n\\- Fast Boot has been disabled  \n\\- The UEFI Shell commands work but the USB and SSD both freeze even after booting from there.\n\nAt this point, I’ve exhausted all the troubleshooting I could think of, and even booting from a working USB stick fails. The PC seems functional otherwise, SSD, RAM, GPU, motherboard etc have been tested.  \nSomeone have some interesting insight or things I can try to make it work again? As previously stated it has been already analized by a professional once and he couldn't really find a solution.  \nThank you for your time",

    "selftext": "Hey, I got a prebuilt from newegg about a year ago. I am now noticing a small gurgle coming from the radiator part of my AIO cooler. This was not happening previously and begin happening a few days ago. The gurgle is pretty subtle in person and usually goes away after about an hour or two of being on. I've tested my CPU under load while the gurgling is happening and it doesn't seem to have a noticeable effect on the temps. I moved the location of my PC in my house about 3 weeks ago, though the gurgle only started about 3 days ago, I've heard relocating can cause bubbles but it did not happen when initially relocated. I've also tried tipping the PC back and forth while it is on which doesn't seem to fix the noise, if anything it seems to make it slightly worse. I've checked the fittings as well, and do not notice any looseness or damage on any of the connections. Should I make an appointment to get my liquid cooling replaced or should it be OK? I'm struggling to find my exact brand of cpu cooler, I believe it is a Enermax ELC-LMT360-w-aRGB, though not exactly sure. the listing to the full pc specs are here: [https://www.newegg.com/p/3D5-002N-00092?Item=9SIB5FPK7M8378](https://www.newegg.com/p/3D5-002N-00092?Item=9SIB5FPK7M8378)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vcocrktuhqwf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bec29dbdc4b0c49b12cf8f48159b03910cec8f50\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1odlsi4/video/0lbbmkjvhqwf1/player\n\n",

    "selftext": "I, alongside with my dad and cousins, built my old computer back in 2017. It had awesome specs back in the day, with an i7-8700k, originally 16, now 32GB of DDR4 RAM and a good old GTX 1060.\n\nFinally after a while, I decided to buy myself a new computer. This one's rocking a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32GB DDR5 Corsair RAM, and a lovely 9070XT 16GB model. My 1060 had 6GB! This jump will be awesome.\n\nI've decided to put it all in this Phanteks Evolv S2 case after seeing it on one of Optimum's YouTube videos. Truly does look stunning. Unfortunately, my flooring is carpet so I have this smoothed off wooden plank that I have underneath and there are legs on this case, so it isn't suffocating. The temps are good with 37⁰c idle and the motherboard being around 32⁰c. I've yet to place it under any stress testing however.\n\nI do feel very icky about this purchase. It costed me roughly $3000 AUD ($2000 USD), and this was something I purchased all on my very own. I kept debating whether I even needed a new computer and I kept saying to myself \"I don't, I don't, I don't\" even though there was occasional artefacts showing on the display, the display randomly black screening and occasional freezes despite reinstalling Windows multiple times on SSD. It was something that I definitely needed, but it's the first time I've ever spent this amount of big money before.\n\nIn any case (pun totally intended) though, this computer will definitely last me another 8+ years. I can't wait to have a ton of fun with this PC. \n\nSee y'all in another 8+ years when I build my next PC loll",

I also remote in to PCs overseas for a studio I work for so having support for decent wifi connection is needed (ethernet isn't really doable where I'm currently living)\n\nCurrently my budget for a mobo is roughly $300AUD, I'm mainly looking for something that is a direct upgrade to my current mobo. Full size ATX would be nice but obviously budget might make that difficult.\n\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated, even if that recommendation is holding off to upgrade my motherboard until I can spend more. However ideally I'd like to grab a new mobo when I get my m.2.",

I was the lucky one to be selected as the winner! The PC  was even more glorious in person. Here's a quick rundown of the specs:\n\nIntel Core i5-14600K Processor\n\nZotac RTX 5060 Graphics Card\n\nASUS STRIX Z790-I Motherboard\n\nCooler Master 850W SFX Power Supply\n\nTrident Z 32GB DDR5 6000MT/s Memory\n\nWD BLACK 1TB SN7100 NVMe SSD (7,250MB/s)\n\n  \nThis thing fired right up and performed so well...I was getting well over 60 FPS on high settings while playing Battlefield 6.\n\n  \nHuge thanks goes to u/DaKrazyKid for running the giveaway and SignalRGB for building such a cool PC! This is going to be quite a conversation piece for years to come.\n\n\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I've been playing FPS game for a while, using Ikea solid wood tabletop with 2 alex drawer on each side, and a regular office chair, but i have been having pain on my right back muscle where I hold my mouse, I'm thinking it's the chair problem, so after a few months I bite the bullet and bought the HM Embody gaming chair.\n\nUnfortunately that doesn't seems to fix my problem and seems to make it worse in some way, because I want good control on my mouse, I want my elbow to be slightly or same level of my desk on my sit up straight position, but that means I would have to put my chair near the highest height, and my footrest of 12cm are barely touching my feet, not really feel supported.\n\nThen, my thigh and leg feel numb, because the embody chair seems to be softer on the back, and it cut off blood circulation for my entire thigh and leg, this impact my gaming performance by huge, always adjusting myself feels like something is off.\n\nI'm 5'9\" (175cm) and 219lbs (99kg), could this be my overweight problem (I'm trying to lose weight...) and my desk problem, i feel like the right desk height should be my current desk height \\~75cm minus my footrest 12cm, so the ideal desk height for me is something around 63\\~65cm? i don't really see desk that are that low...\n\nAnyone have solution to the issue?",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

Really like my setup I’ve only got one cable coming down which is my power cable and cable management is really clean. This also took me a bit as I was trying to figure out the best solution. My solution was using a server rack cable management module that’s aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you’d do!",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

    "selftext": "My first mechanical keyboard was an aluminum NK65 into which I popped Zilents, but it soon became a closet board (and then I left it at my childhood home for when I visit the ‘rents and work from here). Since I’ve bought a couple ai03 boards, a Neo Ergo, a Rama U-80B, a couple Jacky Hippos, and the Classic TKL. The latter most really shocked me with how good it felt and sounded at the price point. I also stocked up on Gateron Oil Kings because of all the praise and was really shocked at how great they feel out of the box without added lube.\n\nAnyways, this week I’ve been back home and I’m miserable typing on the NK65. Everything feels and sounds bad. Maybe it’s because I’m a linear man now, and obviously I’m typing on better quality boards at home, but it’s also revelatory to me just how much progress has been made, on switch quality, on stabilizers, on affordable boards. I’m probably going to buy another Classic TKL to leave here and retire/ewaste my old NK alu boards (I have the 80% one also).\n\nCurious if others have found themselves having to type on their first boards from years back and what that experience was like. It has been very very hard for me to revert.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/0w3npmpm8owf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a0b2454e02fa794d8b0cb3ee02e55a9d3c7a9db\n\nChilkey hosted a giveaway for the new ND104 keyboard, I was the fortunate one to win it and received it just today, so far it's been so great, you can tell this is a quality keyboard.\n\nStarting off, feels extremely heavy and bulky, doesn't feel cheap at all, feels pretty solid and durable. Overall feels expensive.\n\nBuild quality 10/10 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mpl47f4fowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae90f1ab48f6aab4d5b4eadaf9bd55c81359175d\n\nThe keyboard looks pretty darn well first look, giving off that \"cute aesthetic\" vibe to it (IMHO), I was a bit disappointed because my whole setup is dark/black and the keyboard is standing out between all the dark parts of my PC. I was hoping for the black edition but was out of stock so it's understandable.\n\nI been using 60% and 75% keyboards for 3 years now and overall this big keyboard felt a bit weird at first but then became second nature after 1 or 2 hours. Not to mention it feels smooth to type (using it to type this post RN lol) and it's not that loud, has that \"THOCK\" sound that some are never endlessly looking for.\n\nThe RGB feels okay, wish it was more \"shine through\" (this could be fixed with some shine through keycaps) and it feels okay, have not set it up that much but overall I like it, not intrusive like others.\n\nLooks and feel: 9.5/10\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn8a2p8vfowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c0d3fe5999a988e455883a0f382b130c05a124\n\n  \nThis keyboard has a TON of features, starting with the little screen \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wflohgblowf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4432d2d43d32bcbeff9208a1c4ca89358224d92d\n\nFully customizable and guess what? You don't need an additional driver/software on your PC for yet another keyboard, this one can be used via browser (I think only on Google Chrome) but that's a FANTASTIC advantage, you can use it on Linux and Mac without sacrificing the software or customization of the keys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yps8hhyklowf1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fbd0e74884beee989f1b7b101b883bf279171b9\n\nKudos to Chiikey for this, this is a fantastic feature and something to praise, also it was incredibly easy to just post a gif to the little screen instead of having to cut the gif into multiple images and upload them all like other keyboards\n\nSoftware/Drivers 11/10\n\nAs for the unboxing process it was pretty standard and actually a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nFor starters you do not get any fancy tools to remove the keycaps or the mechanical switches itself, still no clear indication if it's hot swappable 3 or 5 pins (still yet to tear it down, wanted to test it out of the box with no modifications or me removing parts of it) it IS hot swappable but there's no really a lot of transparency of how many pins or what switches are supported.\n\nYou don't get any additional switches unlike other keyboards (some only bring 3 but at least they bring them unlike this one) there's the tab for the compartment where you can store things and also you get some screws, some plastic... tabs? and a little black thing that I am yet to recognize at the time of writing.\n\nAnd of course, you get a USB cable to charge or connect your keyboard, type C so no worries there.\n\nThe USB dongle is inside the keyboard on the bottom part hidden in a tiny\n\nThe packaging was impeccable, very beautiful box and the keyboard was very well wrapped and protected, no dents or scratches and it wasn't all over the place, all neatly packaged in a big rectangular box.\n\nUnboxing and contents: 5/10 \n\nAs mentioned before the switches on this keyboard make a very satisfying \"THOCK\" \"THOCK\" sound, it's not clear if this is lubed but it really feels good, really really good, not that loud too just \"right\"\n\nIt doesn't strain my hands as far as I tested it (around 5 or 6 hours in total, more than enough for someone who works at an office and is constantly typing non stop, even now typing this review lol)\n\nMy only complaint is that no matter what I did, the knob click behaviour never changed when I changed it in the software, it always defaults to \"mute\" instead of \"pause\" or play.\n\nTyping experience 8.5/10\n\nTotal score: 10 + 9.5 + 11 + 5 + 8.5 / 5 = 8.8/10 \n\nPersonal score being honest would be more of a 9/10, it's a pretty darn good keyboard and worth every penny, my only grip is the lack of switches or tools to customize the keyboard to your heart's content and the color, really wish it could have been the dark colored version but that's something I will learn to live with.\n\nCheers!",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

    "selftext": "After almost a decade, I’ve been slowly getting soured by the keyboard hobby earlier in this year cos of a lot of factors like some vendors disappearing after taking our money. And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

    "title": "Tex Shinobi - mini-review",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/osqvzf04zpwf1.jpg?width=1840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934d86fd6b2611ac9c1986eb8209ea86c09bf7b4\n\nA quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to “dynamat” which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I’ve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that’s ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn’t hard with the tool they provide. I’ve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It’s the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn’t know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn’t reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won’t be my daily driver but it’s a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI’ll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .  everything went smoothly;  no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.  It’s probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and “how to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers” videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).  Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote  - without needing to look at any references during the build.  \n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced — just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;  make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;  checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn—->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys).  \n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:  prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it’s too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you’re probably excited to complete quickly.  The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta’ get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**  if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n   **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;  $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;  unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.  (I’m liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n ",

I also swapped out the knobs, the badge on the keyboard and the badge on the numpad for gold options. Loving the brass plate in this build.\n\nSwitches: Neo X Keygeek Oat\n\nKeycaps: GMK Black & Gold ",

    "selftext": "My experiences:\n\n**Corsair K95 (gone)**\n\nThe prints on that are laser imprinted and quickly faded. it became glossy and looked dirty after some use. It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper.\n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone as some reccomended it to me but GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust AI 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at an odd location. \n\nWhat other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI have posted this to Geek Hack also, but it's been over a week and my post has not been approved. I messaged the moderator of the Geek Hack interest checked forums, and they have not replied yet. So I thought I would make this post here also.\n\nI've got the prototype complete. If you guys have any suggestions of where I should sell this or if anyone would like to partner with me, please let me know.\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**ANSI60**\n\nA 4mm keyboard plate with multiple layout support.\n\n**Supported Layouts**\n\n* Split Backspace\n* Split Right Shift\n* Stepped Caps Lock\n* 7u Spacebar\n\n[Supported Layouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YHOHfZDZJXJPjWIfWgxHSUXzf9Ksx9y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Aluminum\n* Polycarbonate (PC)\n\n**Compatibility**\n\n* **Mounting styles:** Tray Mount\n* **Form factor:** 60% ANSI\n\n**Supported PCBs**\n\n* Venom HE 60% PCB\n* GH60 and DZ60 variants\n* Wooting 60HE\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**Introduction / Vision**\n\nIntroducing the **ANSI60** — a 4mm keyboard plate crafted for enthusiasts seeking to push the boundaries of typing acoustics and feel.   \nAt nearly three times the thickness of a standard 1.5mm plate, the ANSI60 transforms vibrational behavior, producing a crisper, more rounded tone with a fuller frequency response across the sound spectrum.\n\nMore than just thicker — the ANSI60 delivers a distinct typing experience unlike standard 1.5mm plates. With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested.

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

It needs a little tidy up but it works like a dream. No more having to charge every other day, no more waiting for the board to wake up, no more cables! ",

    "selftext": "My first mechanical keyboard was an aluminum NK65 into which I popped Zilents, but it soon became a closet board (and then I left it at my childhood home for when I visit the ‘rents and work from here). Since I’ve bought a couple ai03 boards, a Neo Ergo, a Rama U-80B, a couple Jacky Hippos, and the Classic TKL. The latter most really shocked me with how good it felt and sounded at the price point. I also stocked up on Gateron Oil Kings because of all the praise and was really shocked at how great they feel out of the box without added lube.\n\nAnyways, this week I’ve been back home and I’m miserable typing on the NK65. Everything feels and sounds bad. Maybe it’s because I’m a linear man now, and obviously I’m typing on better quality boards at home, but it’s also revelatory to me just how much progress has been made, on switch quality, on stabilizers, on affordable boards. I’m probably going to buy another Classic TKL to leave here and retire/ewaste my old NK alu boards (I have the 80% one also).\n\nCurious if others have found themselves having to type on their first boards from years back and what that experience was like. It has been very very hard for me to revert.",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

Overall feels expensive.\n\nBuild quality 10/10 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mpl47f4fowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae90f1ab48f6aab4d5b4eadaf9bd55c81359175d\n\nThe keyboard looks pretty darn well first look, giving off that \"cute aesthetic\" vibe to it (IMHO), I was a bit disappointed because my whole setup is dark/black and the keyboard is standing out between all the dark parts of my PC. I was hoping for the black edition but was out of stock so it's understandable.\n\nI been using 60% and 75% keyboards for 3 years now and overall this big keyboard felt a bit weird at first but then became second nature after 1 or 2 hours. Not to mention it feels smooth to type (using it to type this post RN lol) and it's not that loud, has that \"THOCK\" sound that some are never endlessly looking for.\n\nThe RGB feels okay, wish it was more \"shine through\" (this could be fixed with some shine through keycaps) and it feels okay, have not set it up that much but overall I like it, not intrusive like others.\n\nLooks and feel: 9.5/10\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn8a2p8vfowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c0d3fe5999a988e455883a0f382b130c05a124\n\n  \nThis keyboard has a TON of features, starting with the little screen \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wflohgblowf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4432d2d43d32bcbeff9208a1c4ca89358224d92d\n\nFully customizable and guess what? You don't need an additional driver/software on your PC for yet another keyboard, this one can be used via browser (I think only on Google Chrome) but that's a FANTASTIC advantage, you can use it on Linux and Mac without sacrificing the software or customization of the keys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yps8hhyklowf1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fbd0e74884beee989f1b7b101b883bf279171b9\n\nKudos to Chiikey for this, this is a fantastic feature and something to praise, also it was incredibly easy to just post a gif to the little screen instead of having to cut the gif into multiple images and upload them all like other keyboards\n\nSoftware/Drivers 11/10\n\nAs for the unboxing process it was pretty standard and actually a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nFor starters you do not get any fancy tools to remove the keycaps or the mechanical switches itself, still no clear indication if it's hot swappable 3 or 5 pins (still yet to tear it down, wanted to test it out of the box with no modifications or me removing parts of it) it IS hot swappable but there's no really a lot of transparency of how many pins or what switches are supported.\n\nYou don't get any additional switches unlike other keyboards (some only bring 3 but at least they bring them unlike this one) there's the tab for the compartment where you can store things and also you get some screws, some plastic... tabs? and a little black thing that I am yet to recognize at the time of writing.\n\nAnd of course, you get a USB cable to charge or connect your keyboard, type C so no worries there.\n\nThe USB dongle is inside the keyboard on the bottom part hidden in a tiny\n\nThe packaging was impeccable, very beautiful box and the keyboard was very well wrapped and protected, no dents or scratches and it wasn't all over the place, all neatly packaged in a big rectangular box.\n\nUnboxing and contents: 5/10 \n\nAs mentioned before the switches on this keyboard make a very satisfying \"THOCK\" \"THOCK\" sound, it's not clear if this is lubed but it really feels good, really really good, not that loud too just \"right\"\n\nIt doesn't strain my hands as far as I tested it (around 5 or 6 hours in total, more than enough for someone who works at an office and is constantly typing non stop, even now typing this review lol)\n\nMy only complaint is that no matter what I did, the knob click behaviour never changed when I changed it in the software, it always defaults to \"mute\" instead of \"pause\" or play.\n\nTyping experience 8.5/10\n\nTotal score: 10 + 9.5 + 11 + 5 + 8.5 / 5 = 8.8/10 \n\nPersonal score being honest would be more of a 9/10, it's a pretty darn good keyboard and worth every penny, my only grip is the lack of switches or tools to customize the keyboard to your heart's content and the color, really wish it could have been the dark colored version but that's something I will learn to live with.\n\nCheers!",

Just thought this was funny)\n\nSaw a listing on the site that I figured had to be a mistake - an Attack Shark M86 tri-mode hot swap keyboard with one of the colour options listed as £3.83, with local shipping.\n\nI’m like “There’s no way they’ll honour that. They’ll either cancel or just ship a cable or something”.\n\nEither way, placed the order anyway on Sunday night (19th), it went through with no issue.\n\nThe order then showed as shipped yesterday, and I’m thinking cool, at least I’ll get *something* for my money, especially as the one I ordered has since had its price corrected and is now saying it does not ship to my location.\n\nLo and behold, they actually honoured the sale and the keyboard arrived today (via Amazon, no less) so I’m probably going to give it to my 14 year old son as his first mech board to play with.",

The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

    "selftext": "After almost a decade, I’ve been slowly getting soured by the keyboard hobby earlier in this year cos of a lot of factors like some vendors disappearing after taking our money. And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

    "title": "Tex Shinobi - mini-review",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/osqvzf04zpwf1.jpg?width=1840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934d86fd6b2611ac9c1986eb8209ea86c09bf7b4\n\nA quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

Also, are OLED monitors worth it for console gaming, or should I stick with a high-end LCD?\n\nI would still want my game to look as best as it can be with the best possible frames etc and least controller delay. \n\nWould really appreciate any recommendations for the best monitors that suit competitive play.\n\nI currently have an ASUS 24” 1080 240hz monitor however it’s only 2.0 HDMI. I can feel the delay quite alot especially compared to how smooth it feels in PC. I know it won’t be as smooth as that, but my friends who switched don’t have this delay problem like I do. \n\nThanks! ",

    "selftext": "I just got my first OLED monitor, the MSI MAG 272qpw. The color contrast is great and all, blacks are nice and deep, but reading text really hurts my head. I use my PC for 60% work from home and 40% gaming, and while gaming is amazing, text (even in games) sucks. I sit pretty close to my monitor so I definitely notice the fringing. Every 5 minutes the entire display shifts a pixel, which can be dizzying. Also, I feel like the colors can be over saturated. I’m coming from a cheapo decogear 1440p 120hz VA, much easier on the eyes for productivity but the black smearing is absolutely horrendous. \n\nAm I stuck with IPS then? I’ll have about 600usd when I return this so wondering if that is a good budget for a good display. Or should I be looking for mini-LED? Google didn’t turn up very many options for that (looking for 3440x1440). Or maybe OLED technology is too into its infancy and I should wait it out until there are less drawbacks.",

    "selftext": "I switched to the MSI MAG 271QPX QD-OLED (E2) from a high-end IPS panel I’d been using for a few years, and honestly… I’m still kind of in shock at how good this thing looks. I don’t even know if it’s just the OLED magic or if MSI really nailed something here, but the difference is night and day.\n\nThe first thing that hit me was the contrast. Blacks are actually black — like the screen disappears in dark scenes — and the colours just pop without feeling cartoonish. Games I’ve played a hundred times suddenly look completely different, like they’ve got more depth or atmosphere. Even desktop stuff feels smoother and cleaner somehow.\n\nThe 240 Hz refresh rate feels incredible too. I thought my old 165 Hz IPS was already fast, but this just feels more fluid and precise. \n\nBuild quality’s solid as well. The stand is sturdy, bezels are slim, and overall it feels more premium than I expected. But it could have been better looking.\n\nNo signs of burn-in yet, though I’m still paranoid about static stuff. MSI’s got some built-in screen protection features, and I’ve been letting it run its refresh cycles regularly.\n\nOverall, switching from IPS to this feels like a massive upgrade. The image quality, the smoothness, the way everything just feels better — it’s honestly hard to go back. I don’t know if it’s purely because it’s OLED or if MSI just nailed this model, but either way, this monitor is ridiculous.",

    "selftext": "I just bought this monitor and it has one problem. Some particular colors around yellow-orange area appear desaturated. It appears on all settings, on HDMI and DP. It seems like the monitor is capable of displaying fully saturated yellow, in theory it has  136% sRGB coverage and 101% Adobe RGB. I can switch to DCI-P3 to oversaturate everything, but this particular color will still appear less saturated compared to others. Since I never done any color calibration, my question is: would it solve this issue? It really appears like there is some extra blue that shouldn't be there. Other gradients between extreme colors look fine.",

Both of these monitors are 4k, and I think they both have a matte finish (though I’d prefer a semi-matte or ideally gloss finish based on my experience with my laptops).\n\nGoals: crispiest possible image during gaming.\n\nUse case: non-competitive gaming (Skyrim, Fallout, Elden Ring, Mass Effect, etc), CAD/CAM, media, and general productivity (data processing, figure creation, and simulations for my PhD).\n\nWhat I like about the Gigabyte:\n• OLED (supposedly better image?)\n• Higher refresh rate\n• Lower latency\n\nWhat I like about the Samsung:\n• Curved display\n• Larger\n• Less expensive\n\nMy concerns:\n• I’ve heard of issues with the Samsung, but it sounds like a firmware update and some settings adjustments can fix the VRR flicker and scan line images that people have complained about.\n• I really do prefer curved monitors, but Rtings.com has the Gigabyte monitor as one of their best, and with it only being $200 more, this feels like a no-brainer for most people.\n\nDoes anyone have any firsthand experience with either of these monitors that can chime in? Or, if anyone has any other recommendations, I’m open to that too. The only things that I’m strongly against are the ultra-wide monitors. A friend of mine has an ultra-wide Alienware and I did not like gaming in that when he let me try it (much to his disbelief 😂). Trying to keep the price less than $1k for the monitor, so please bear that in mind if you’re going to make a monitor suggestion.\n\nThanks, peeps! 😁",

I considered buying an OLED Monitor (QD-OLED) but I am afraid of burn-ins, since I also play a lot of strategy games with a lot of static pictures. Sporadically I also do a little office work and plan on improving my IT Skills, which also have a lot of static pictures while doing it. \n\n  \nThats why I want to choose a \"middle ground option\" and go for a Mini-LED Monitor. Of all the things I saw on the Internet the Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 was suggested a lot of times. Does anyone of you have experiences with that monitor? How is it compared to an IPS Panel? Would you buy it? Are there any recommendations along the way which I should consider? Are there alternative Mini-LED Monitors which you consider better? \n\nKind regards\n\nBlackbeard",

I am using this HDMI cable [https://www.jumbo.ae/hama-ham-122221-high-speed-hdmia-cable-plug-plug-ethernet-gold-plated-2-0-m.html](https://www.jumbo.ae/hama-ham-122221-high-speed-hdmia-cable-plug-plug-ethernet-gold-plated-2-0-m.html) and I bought it in 2021.\n\nI want to buy:\n\n1. A new monitor which is [https://961souq.com/products/asus-rog-strix-xg43uq-43-4k-gaming-monitor-144hz](https://961souq.com/products/asus-rog-strix-xg43uq-43-4k-gaming-monitor-144hz)\n2. A new surround sound soundbar which is [https://961souq.com/products/samsung-s-series-soundbar-hw-s66d-5-0ch](https://961souq.com/products/samsung-s-series-soundbar-hw-s66d-5-0ch)\n\nI want to mirror the laptop screen which is set to 1080p to the monitor and I should get 144hz on the monitor when I do that.\n\nThe soundbar supports HDMI ARC, optical, aux and bluetooth.\n\nI can pair the soundbar to my laptop or tv but the problem is that the electricity cuts multiple times daily as it switches between government electricity and generator electricity and when that happens the soundbar and monitor will switch off and then back on. I am unsure if the soundbar will automatically pair again when it switches on so pairing by bluetooth is messy.\n\nMy laptop and the monitor don't have HDMI ARC.\n\nThe simplest solution is I use an AUX audio cable but if I do that then I will lose the surround sound and I don't want that.\n\nThus the remaining option is I use optical and I have to get an HDMI audio extractor box. I have to connect my laptop to HDMI input of the box and connect the monitor to the HDMI output of the box. The box should have an optical port for the audio and I will connect the soundbar to it and I should get surround sound if I do that. When the electricity cuts then the tv, sound bar and the HDMI audio extractor box will switch off but everything should resume when they switch back on.\n\nThere are some cheap quality HDMI audio extractor boxes which say 4k 60hz. They could be 60hz at 1080p so that means that I will get 60hz on the monitor if I use a cheap quality HDMI audio extractor box. Thus I need to buy a proper HDMI 2.1 audio extractor box like [https://www.amazon.com/Extractor-Optical-Adapter-Speakers-Headphones/dp/B0FCYVBZPK/ref=sr\\_1\\_4](https://www.amazon.com/Extractor-Optical-Adapter-Speakers-Headphones/dp/B0FCYVBZPK/ref=sr_1_4) which supports 1080p 120hz and it could give me 144hz. Is what I said correct?\n\nMy HDMI wire is old and it could be HDMI 2.0 certified. Is that ok or I need to buy a new HDMI wire which is HDMI 2.1 certified? I think that a HDMI 2.0 certified wire is enough for 1080p 120hz or 144hz and I don't need a HDMI 2.1 certified wire. Is what I said correct?",

Is there any reliable monitor (Dell, LG, BenQ) that combines HDMI 2.1 and a functional PD (30W+) that drops below $600 or $650 on sale?\nThanks for the help!\n\nTL;DR: Searching for a 27-32\" 2K/4K flat monitor under $600. It needs both HDMI 2.1 (for gaming) and functional USB-C PD >18W (to charge my iPad Pro). The models I've found either fail on PD (MSI OLED) or have major QC risks (INNOCN).

I don’t even know if it’s just the OLED magic or if MSI really nailed something here, but the difference is night and day.\n\nThe first thing that hit me was the contrast. Blacks are actually black — like the screen disappears in dark scenes — and the colours just pop without feeling cartoonish. Games I’ve played a hundred times suddenly look completely different, like they’ve got more depth or atmosphere. Even desktop stuff feels smoother and cleaner somehow.\n\nThe 240 Hz refresh rate feels incredible too. I thought my old 165 Hz IPS was already fast, but this just feels more fluid and precise. \n\nBuild quality’s solid as well. The stand is sturdy, bezels are slim, and overall it feels more premium than I expected. But it could have been better looking.\n\nNo signs of burn-in yet, though I’m still paranoid about static stuff. MSI’s got some built-in screen protection features, and I’ve been letting it run its refresh cycles regularly.\n\nOverall, switching from IPS to this feels like a massive upgrade. The image quality, the smoothness, the way everything just feels better — it’s honestly hard to go back. I don’t know if it’s purely because it’s OLED or if MSI just nailed this model, but either way, this monitor is ridiculous.",

I use my PC for 60% work from home and 40% gaming, and while gaming is amazing, text (even in games) sucks. I sit pretty close to my monitor so I definitely notice the fringing. Every 5 minutes the entire display shifts a pixel, which can be dizzying. Also, I feel like the colors can be over saturated. I’m coming from a cheapo decogear 1440p 120hz VA, much easier on the eyes for productivity but the black smearing is absolutely horrendous. \n\nAm I stuck with IPS then? I’ll have about 600usd when I return this so wondering if that is a good budget for a good display. Or should I be looking for mini-LED? Google didn’t turn up very many options for that (looking for 3440x1440). Or maybe OLED technology is too into its infancy and I should wait it out until there are less drawbacks.",

    "selftext": "Ok. So I’m building my first PC and I’m torn between the two monitors and I need help from you monitor gurus because I’m not really sure what the best route is. Both of these monitors are 4k, and I think they both have a matte finish (though I’d prefer a semi-matte or ideally gloss finish based on my experience with my laptops).\n\nGoals: crispiest possible image during gaming.\n\nUse case: non-competitive gaming (Skyrim, Fallout, Elden Ring, Mass Effect, etc), CAD/CAM, media, and general productivity (data processing, figure creation, and simulations for my PhD).\n\nWhat I like about the Gigabyte:\n• OLED (supposedly better image?)\n• Higher refresh rate\n• Lower latency\n\nWhat I like about the Samsung:\n• Curved display\n• Larger\n• Less expensive\n\nMy concerns:\n• I’ve heard of issues with the Samsung, but it sounds like a firmware update and some settings adjustments can fix the VRR flicker and scan line images that people have complained about.\n• I really do prefer curved monitors, but Rtings.com has the Gigabyte monitor as one of their best, and with it only being $200 more, this feels like a no-brainer for most people.\n\nDoes anyone have any firsthand experience with either of these monitors that can chime in? Or, if anyone has any other recommendations, I’m open to that too. The only things that I’m strongly against are the ultra-wide monitors. A friend of mine has an ultra-wide Alienware and I did not like gaming in that when he let me try it (much to his disbelief 😂). Trying to keep the price less than $1k for the monitor, so please bear that in mind if you’re going to make a monitor suggestion.\n\nThanks, peeps! 😁",

A single monitor setup for work purpose (mostly coding) and watching videos.    \nWhat are the musts ? Minimum 120hz refresh rate, 32 inch and a 4k res with a \"Mac-Fitting\" ppi.  \n\nOne option I found for now is the Dell U3225QE - I know that I need a good thunderbolt cable or a good usb-c to dp adapter for dp alt mode to run it with 120hz. But as far as I found out, the MacBook should be able to handle it.  \n\n**My question:**  \n\n\\- Are there any better options that you can suggest ?  \n\\- Is it possible to run more than 120hz with the M2 Chip ?  \n\nThanks a lot!",

    "selftext": "I switched to the MSI MAG 271QPX QD-OLED (E2) from a high-end IPS panel I’d been using for a few years, and honestly… I’m still kind of in shock at how good this thing looks. I don’t even know if it’s just the OLED magic or if MSI really nailed something here, but the difference is night and day.\n\nThe first thing that hit me was the contrast. Blacks are actually black — like the screen disappears in dark scenes — and the colours just pop without feeling cartoonish. Games I’ve played a hundred times suddenly look completely different, like they’ve got more depth or atmosphere. Even desktop stuff feels smoother and cleaner somehow.\n\nThe 240 Hz refresh rate feels incredible too. I thought my old 165 Hz IPS was already fast, but this just feels more fluid and precise. \n\nBuild quality’s solid as well. The stand is sturdy, bezels are slim, and overall it feels more premium than I expected. But it could have been better looking.\n\nNo signs of burn-in yet, though I’m still paranoid about static stuff. MSI’s got some built-in screen protection features, and I’ve been letting it run its refresh cycles regularly.\n\nOverall, switching from IPS to this feels like a massive upgrade. The image quality, the smoothness, the way everything just feels better — it’s honestly hard to go back. I don’t know if it’s purely because it’s OLED or if MSI just nailed this model, but either way, this monitor is ridiculous.",

    "selftext": "I just got my first OLED monitor, the MSI MAG 272qpw. The color contrast is great and all, blacks are nice and deep, but reading text really hurts my head. I use my PC for 60% work from home and 40% gaming, and while gaming is amazing, text (even in games) sucks. I sit pretty close to my monitor so I definitely notice the fringing. Every 5 minutes the entire display shifts a pixel, which can be dizzying. Also, I feel like the colors can be over saturated. I’m coming from a cheapo decogear 1440p 120hz VA, much easier on the eyes for productivity but the black smearing is absolutely horrendous. \n\nAm I stuck with IPS then? I’ll have about 600usd when I return this so wondering if that is a good budget for a good display. Or should I be looking for mini-LED? Google didn’t turn up very many options for that (looking for 3440x1440). Or maybe OLED technology is too into its infancy and I should wait it out until there are less drawbacks.",

    "selftext": "Ok. So I’m building my first PC and I’m torn between the two monitors and I need help from you monitor gurus because I’m not really sure what the best route is. Both of these monitors are 4k, and I think they both have a matte finish (though I’d prefer a semi-matte or ideally gloss finish based on my experience with my laptops).\n\nGoals: crispiest possible image during gaming.\n\nUse case: non-competitive gaming (Skyrim, Fallout, Elden Ring, Mass Effect, etc), CAD/CAM, media, and general productivity (data processing, figure creation, and simulations for my PhD).\n\nWhat I like about the Gigabyte:\n• OLED (supposedly better image?)\n• Higher refresh rate\n• Lower latency\n\nWhat I like about the Samsung:\n• Curved display\n• Larger\n• Less expensive\n\nMy concerns:\n• I’ve heard of issues with the Samsung, but it sounds like a firmware update and some settings adjustments can fix the VRR flicker and scan line images that people have complained about.\n• I really do prefer curved monitors, but Rtings.com has the Gigabyte monitor as one of their best, and with it only being $200 more, this feels like a no-brainer for most people.\n\nDoes anyone have any firsthand experience with either of these monitors that can chime in? Or, if anyone has any other recommendations, I’m open to that too. The only things that I’m strongly against are the ultra-wide monitors. A friend of mine has an ultra-wide Alienware and I did not like gaming in that when he let me try it (much to his disbelief 😂). Trying to keep the price less than $1k for the monitor, so please bear that in mind if you’re going to make a monitor suggestion.\n\nThanks, peeps! 😁",

    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide. \n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs. \n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much. \n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones. I think it is because it has a smaller driver or its driver is not as tall.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Sounds muffled.\n* The soundstage is very small.\n* I hate it.\n\n\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/4ulrwz8x1rwf1.png?width=2130&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cd2aba14f52d8ec06ac38dc280de34349e96b76\n\nSo I've eq'ed before but usual more towards a specific target frequency rather than what I want in my sound. The FT1 coming from some really good planar iems is an amazing leap forward for paying basically the same price. I ordered better ear pads, a capra strap. These will be the ultimate cans. Unfortunately the description on the graph site isn't detailed enough for me personally to truly understand so now we are here.\n\nI feel like the ft1's sound is very relaxing. The bass is phenomenal and very deep and visceral. The vocals are smooth. Treble is good for long term listening I'll say. But I feel like I can get a bit more excitement from these headphones. I listen to a lot of rap, a lot of female vocalist from all genres, house, dance, alternative. So bass is a common thing amongst all these genres. Boom, I added a bit more sub bass to give me some extra feelings. I've heard the sennheiser having amazing mids and since the ft1's are mildly v shaped, I raised the mids a tad bit. So I kinda eq'ed my graph to reflect the HDB 630 lower and upper mids and kept the rest the same. It's for sure, much more engaging vocally. I never realized how laid back vocals were. I will try the 6XX mids and see if I like it more. I know drivers play a big part in how sound truly is portrayed. But It made a good enough difference.\n\nNow I'm curious on some things I've noticed. What is the peak in the ft1's line around 1.8K. What is this specific frequency range responsible for. I also noticed the ft1's has a lot less treble in the 6-7K range than most cans. I felt like treble is the feeling I felt on my bones in the front of my face. I did notice raising this area was responsible for this feeling, that's maybe why these aren't as fatiguing to listen to long term. I'm a bit sensitive to treble but even the s12 planars I eq'ed like -2db from 6-7.5K and it was perfect. So I can for sure bump this area up a bit. It's interesting because my friend can use the dt 770's at high volume no issues. I could never lol. Those are some bright cans. I used to have em a long time ago that's why I have em on the graph for comparison.\n\nMy last question is eq'ing 8K or higher worth it and what immediate effects would I notice bumping this region?\n\nThanks for feedback, genuinely I'm such an immersive listener. I like to feel my music truly. If anyone here is a fan on the album Kiss Land by the weeknd. Arguably the most immersive album I ever heard. I'm very big on concept and immersion! even for video games.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nI’m starting up a YouTube channel where I talk about Hi-Fi gear, but from the perspective of someone who mostly listens to bass-heavy music: hip-hop, R&B, reggaeton, metal, all the stuff that doesn’t usually get talked about much in the Hi-Fi space.\n\nI’m not asking for buying advice or comparisons, just looking to get some thoughts from people here about what kind of topics or angles would be cool to cover.\n\nI’ve got a few video ideas lined up already:\n\n1: Intro to the hobby : kind of an overview of what “Hi-Fi”actually is, why it’s fun even if your playlists are full of bass-heavy stuff, some common misconceptions, and how EQ can really help shape your sound. Also sort of some intro recs on how you can get a great setup for the same price you could wait a pair of ANC headphones or even less. \n\n2: Wireless ANC headphones: these are where most people start with higher-end gear, so I wanted to do something that talks about that whole category and how it fits into the hobby, especially for people who like tweaking sound profiles and are into bass heavy genres. \n\n3: Talking about my own gear: I’ve got a few headphones I love (HE1K Unveiled, Meze Empyrean 1) and thought it’d be fun to share what I like about them, how they respond to EQ, and how to get the sound you want out of your own setup.\n\nI think there’s room for more content that connects the “audiophile” side of things with the kind of music a lot of us listen to every day, but isn’t really represented in reviews or general talk of the hobby. Sort of give my thoughts on finding the perfect balance of a good thump in the bass, and a super clear rest of the song which just makes the music feel incredibly natural. If you’ve got ideas for what you’d want to see in that kind of channel, I’d love to hear them!\n\nAppreciate anyone who takes the time to read, I’ll share the channel later once the first video’s up. Thanks guys!\n\nEDIT: one last thing, I speak Spanish fluently so I’m thinking of making a Spanish channel as well, if you’re here and speak Spanish and would like that lmk! Thanks! ",

I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025.

    "title": "An Up-To-Date Review of the Bose Open Ultra’s",
    "selftext": "For the TLDR: They’re fantastic buds that I do recommend if you have the extra cash, but if they’re on sale, they’re absolutely worth getting. \n\n**Sound**: I’m not an audiophile, musician, or any sort of person that knows what they’re talking about when it comes to sound quality. So take my opinion here for the normie opinion that it is when I say I think they sound fantastic. I’ve always been impressed with Bose’s acoustics, their products just seem to fill the room or your world in a way I haven’t seen with other products, and these earbuds are no different - particularly with their immersive audio mode. Which makes them feel (I’m choosing the word feel on purpose) like in-ears.   \nRegarding the immersive audio, I think it’s incredibly cool. What it does is employ some acoustics tricks to make the sound like it’s coming from a source in your room. It’s *very* convincing and actually confused me at first when I turned them on thinking there was sound coming from somewhere else when it was in fact the earbuds. The “source” location is placed front and slightly above you so that it sounds like the sound is all around you but will stay stationary if you move your head (which really makes the effect pop). If you move your head and stay in the new position for a bit, the buds will move the source after a few seconds to recreate the “all around” sound again. The “motion” mode just makes the reorientation happen constantly so it’s always slightly following behind your movement. I’ve found myself mostly just always leaving it in motion mode even when sitting and only really putting it in still mode when I want to play with the effect. Switching to the mode does impact the sound, but its just as if the equalizer got changed and you can adjust it out with the equalizer. \n\n**The open ear design:** I’m a huge fan. If I want to block out the world, I have a pair of QC35’s. I use these for anytime I want to be able to hear what’s going on around me or just won’t want to wear a bulky pair of cans and the open ear design is fantastic for it. that said, It does have a noticeable drawback in that it’s easy for outside noise to drown them out. Higher pitched sounds like clanking and crashes are what are going to do it the most, and car noises on busy streets will make you have to turn them up a decent amount to still hear what’s you’re listening to clearly - particularly if you’re listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Personally, I think the trade off is worth it because it’s not a *huge* problem, but it is a noticeable one. \n\n**Comfort:** I have extremely sensitive ears, basically anything that is touching my ears will make them ache after a while. Even beanies will make my ears hurt. So I was absolutely thrilled to find that these earbuds provided a pretty significant reduction in discomfort compared to any other pair of earbuds I’ve worn in my entire life. They’re not painless, and the discomfort is moved to a different location on the ear because of their unique placement, but it’s still a pretty significant improvement and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve also never had them fall out or been even remotely concerned about it. \n\nThey are meant to be placed as close to the ear canal as you can get them, for most people, this will be at a slight angle downwards with the hook placed just above the earlobe, but you can place them pretty much anywhere in the “hook zone” which is anywhere between the lobule and start antihelix of the outer ear, so long as the speakers are inside the general concha (I hope I got the terms right I had to google ear anatomy). You can calibrate the immersion mode to however you’ve placed them on your ear so you don’t need to worry about sound quality reduction, but volume does get noticeably reduced and it gets easier for outside noise to overpower them as the speakers get farther from your ear canal. \n\n**Connectivity:** This is a field where early reviews of the product were rather negative, however Bose seems to have addressed the concerns in their firmware updates since release because I’ve had no issues. They paired easily, immediately reconnect/disconnect when taking them in and out of the case, and easily switch between my paired devices without problem. They do lack a lot of the apple ecosystem bells and whistles you get from a pair of AirPods or Beats, but that’s not Bose’s fault so I’m overlooking it. \n\n**Battery Life:** They have served me great and I’ve yet to have them die on me before I was ready. I’m not using them for all day shifts or anything, but their advertised battery life seems pretty accurate to me, maybe even conservative. The immersion mode does reduce the battery life, but not so much it’s caused me issues, and I usually have them in immersion mode. \n\n**Calls:** This is another field where a lot of early reviews said they were awful, but after having had a few calls, and asking how I sounded, nobody said I sound particularly bad. One or two did note I didn’t sound the clearest, but said it wasn’t enough to be an issue. I know Bose put out a couple firmware updates to address those early complaints and it seems like they succeeded. \n\n**Price:** This is the kicker, at $300, the cost is a big ask. And whether or not it’s worth it will really just entirely depend on your personal finances. I got mine on sale and only paid $240 (I also cashed in reward money and got a limited edition pair which were $375 full price. In the end I only ended up paying \\~$40 out of pocket) so I’m super happy with them and absolutely think they were worth it. If I had paid the full $375 - or even $300 for a normal pair however, I’m not so sure. They’re fantastic, but with them being priced so far above their competition, I definitely wouldn’t have bought them if they weren’t on sale. For the general consumer though, I think they’re a “buy on sale” set of earbuds just because of the price despite how good they are. However, if you happen to be rather wealthy and aren’t so concerned about price, they’re 100% worth grabbing. \n\n**Overall: I love them.** I strongly recommend grabbing them if you’re looking for a pair of open ears (or even in ears). It also doesn’t hurt that they’re rather stylish and kinda look like an ear ring. They sound great, feel great, work great, and stay in your ears great. The price is high, so I’d say wait for a sale if you’re more financially constrained, but if you‘re not, definitely grab them. ",

I wasn't really tampering with any part of it, but just keeping the speakers rotated flat in the case (required given that it's not the biggest case) which must have resulted in the plastic joint breaking off.

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

After testing ones from Bose, Sony, Skullcandy, and Baseus, I’ve been using the XH1 a lot. The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ. It also folds easily, and the ear pads are soft and comfy. I’m not an expert, but it’s been a solid experience overall. ",

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "title": "Audiophile Verdict of Bose QC Ultra 2 Headphones: DO NOT BUY 1ST GEN!",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, £16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

    "selftext": "In an attempt to rescue my almost 10-year-old headphones (ATH-M50x), I decided to tackle all the issues I was having with them. After a teardown of the headphones, I noticed a number of loose black foam pieces in between the driver and the plastic covering. Removing the foam significantly reduced the rattling I was noticing in low frequencies. Was the foam there for any reason? Did I ruin a different range on accident by removing it?",

Truly excellent. \n\nI have noticed some treble sharpness and sibilance on bright recordings such as choral pieces and flute passages (the high note in Miserere, flutes of Debussy Prelude a l’après midi d’un Faune). Even at moderate volume this was uncomfortable.\n\nIn general, the headphones are clearly at least one tier above the CB Sundaras. Better in every way. I would absolutely keep them if it was not for my ears being punished with high piano notes \n\nHas anyone else run into this with the D7200? it?

    "selftext": "I'm potentially in the market for my first pair of earbuds and I had a few questions I was hoping y'all could help with. I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn’t stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it’s no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they’d be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they’re better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they’re still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I’m really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say “sufficient”) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an “active analog mode” which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you’re looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC… look no further!",

    "title": "These are some Ultralight Studio Headphones I designed",
    "selftext": "This is my project headphone for my high school design course.\n\nIt needed to fit the following criteria:\n\n* comfortable for long hours with ultralight weight construction\n* sound quality on par with other reference/studio headphones\n* priced relatively affordable compared to the market\n\n**specs:**\n\n* Driver: Peerless 50 mm driver\n* mass: 170g (without cable)\n* materials:\n   * earcups: PLA-LW and PLA\n   * headband strap: Faux leather\n   * earpad: aliexpress 110mm hybrid velour\n   * everything else: PETG\n* Connection: dual 3.5mm\n\n**Comfort**\n\nBeing 170 grams already makes this a comfortable headphone; it feels weightless on the head. Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025. Huge shout-out to SLaudio and all the amazing people in their discord community\n\nHappy listening, guys",

    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide. \n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs. \n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much. \n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones. I think it is because it has a smaller driver or its driver is not as tall.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Sounds muffled.\n* The soundstage is very small.\n* I hate it.\n\n\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1",

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

The FT1 coming from some really good planar iems is an amazing leap forward for paying basically the same price. I ordered better ear pads, a capra strap. These will be the ultimate cans. Unfortunately the description on the graph site isn't detailed enough for me personally to truly understand so now we are here.\n\nI feel like the ft1's sound is very relaxing. The bass is phenomenal and very deep and visceral. The vocals are smooth. Treble is good for long term listening I'll say. But I feel like I can get a bit more excitement from these headphones. I listen to a lot of rap, a lot of female vocalist from all genres, house, dance, alternative. So bass is a common thing amongst all these genres. Boom, I added a bit more sub bass to give me some extra feelings. I've heard the sennheiser having amazing mids and since the ft1's are mildly v shaped, I raised the mids a tad bit. So I kinda eq'ed my graph to reflect the HDB 630 lower and upper mids and kept the rest the same. It's for sure, much more engaging vocally. I never realized how laid back vocals were. I will try the 6XX mids and see if I like it more. I know drivers play a big part in how sound truly is portrayed. But It made a good enough difference.\n\nNow I'm curious on some things I've noticed. What is the peak in the ft1's line around 1.8K. What is this specific frequency range responsible for. I also noticed the ft1's has a lot less treble in the 6-7K range than most cans. I felt like treble is the feeling I felt on my bones in the front of my face. I did notice raising this area was responsible for this feeling, that's maybe why these aren't as fatiguing to listen to long term. I'm a bit sensitive to treble but even the s12 planars I eq'ed like -2db from 6-7.5K and it was perfect. So I can for sure bump this area up a bit. It's interesting because my friend can use the dt 770's at high volume no issues. I could never lol. Those are some bright cans. I used to have em a long time ago that's why I have em on the graph for comparison.\n\nMy last question is eq'ing 8K or higher worth it and what immediate effects would I notice bumping this region?\n\nThanks for feedback, genuinely I'm such an immersive listener. I like to feel my music truly. If anyone here is a fan on the album Kiss Land by the weeknd. Arguably the most immersive album I ever heard. I'm very big on concept and immersion! even for video games.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nI’m starting up a YouTube channel where I talk about Hi-Fi gear, but from the perspective of someone who mostly listens to bass-heavy music: hip-hop, R&B, reggaeton, metal, all the stuff that doesn’t usually get talked about much in the Hi-Fi space.\n\nI’m not asking for buying advice or comparisons, just looking to get some thoughts from people here about what kind of topics or angles would be cool to cover.\n\nI’ve got a few video ideas lined up already:\n\n1: Intro to the hobby : kind of an overview of what “Hi-Fi”actually is, why it’s fun even if your playlists are full of bass-heavy stuff, some common misconceptions, and how EQ can really help shape your sound. Also sort of some intro recs on how you can get a great setup for the same price you could wait a pair of ANC headphones or even less. \n\n2: Wireless ANC headphones: these are where most people start with higher-end gear, so I wanted to do something that talks about that whole category and how it fits into the hobby, especially for people who like tweaking sound profiles and are into bass heavy genres. \n\n3: Talking about my own gear: I’ve got a few headphones I love (HE1K Unveiled, Meze Empyrean 1) and thought it’d be fun to share what I like about them, how they respond to EQ, and how to get the sound you want out of your own setup.\n\nI think there’s room for more content that connects the “audiophile” side of things with the kind of music a lot of us listen to every day, but isn’t really represented in reviews or general talk of the hobby. Sort of give my thoughts on finding the perfect balance of a good thump in the bass, and a super clear rest of the song which just makes the music feel incredibly natural. If you’ve got ideas for what you’d want to see in that kind of channel, I’d love to hear them!\n\nAppreciate anyone who takes the time to read, I’ll share the channel later once the first video’s up. Thanks guys!\n\nEDIT: one last thing, I speak Spanish fluently so I’m thinking of making a Spanish channel as well, if you’re here and speak Spanish and would like that lmk! Thanks! ",

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "title": "An Up-To-Date Review of the Bose Open Ultra’s",
    "selftext": "For the TLDR: They’re fantastic buds that I do recommend if you have the extra cash, but if they’re on sale, they’re absolutely worth getting. \n\n**Sound**: I’m not an audiophile, musician, or any sort of person that knows what they’re talking about when it comes to sound quality. So take my opinion here for the normie opinion that it is when I say I think they sound fantastic. I’ve always been impressed with Bose’s acoustics, their products just seem to fill the room or your world in a way I haven’t seen with other products, and these earbuds are no different - particularly with their immersive audio mode. Which makes them feel (I’m choosing the word feel on purpose) like in-ears.   \nRegarding the immersive audio, I think it’s incredibly cool. What it does is employ some acoustics tricks to make the sound like it’s coming from a source in your room. It’s *very* convincing and actually confused me at first when I turned them on thinking there was sound coming from somewhere else when it was in fact the earbuds. The “source” location is placed front and slightly above you so that it sounds like the sound is all around you but will stay stationary if you move your head (which really makes the effect pop). If you move your head and stay in the new position for a bit, the buds will move the source after a few seconds to recreate the “all around” sound again. The “motion” mode just makes the reorientation happen constantly so it’s always slightly following behind your movement. I’ve found myself mostly just always leaving it in motion mode even when sitting and only really putting it in still mode when I want to play with the effect. Switching to the mode does impact the sound, but its just as if the equalizer got changed and you can adjust it out with the equalizer. \n\n**The open ear design:** I’m a huge fan. If I want to block out the world, I have a pair of QC35’s. I use these for anytime I want to be able to hear what’s going on around me or just won’t want to wear a bulky pair of cans and the open ear design is fantastic for it. that said, It does have a noticeable drawback in that it’s easy for outside noise to drown them out. Higher pitched sounds like clanking and crashes are what are going to do it the most, and car noises on busy streets will make you have to turn them up a decent amount to still hear what’s you’re listening to clearly - particularly if you’re listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Personally, I think the trade off is worth it because it’s not a *huge* problem, but it is a noticeable one. \n\n**Comfort:** I have extremely sensitive ears, basically anything that is touching my ears will make them ache after a while. Even beanies will make my ears hurt. So I was absolutely thrilled to find that these earbuds provided a pretty significant reduction in discomfort compared to any other pair of earbuds I’ve worn in my entire life. They’re not painless, and the discomfort is moved to a different location on the ear because of their unique placement, but it’s still a pretty significant improvement and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve also never had them fall out or been even remotely concerned about it. \n\nThey are meant to be placed as close to the ear canal as you can get them, for most people, this will be at a slight angle downwards with the hook placed just above the earlobe, but you can place them pretty much anywhere in the “hook zone” which is anywhere between the lobule and start antihelix of the outer ear, so long as the speakers are inside the general concha (I hope I got the terms right I had to google ear anatomy). You can calibrate the immersion mode to however you’ve placed them on your ear so you don’t need to worry about sound quality reduction, but volume does get noticeably reduced and it gets easier for outside noise to overpower them as the speakers get farther from your ear canal. \n\n**Connectivity:** This is a field where early reviews of the product were rather negative, however Bose seems to have addressed the concerns in their firmware updates since release because I’ve had no issues. They paired easily, immediately reconnect/disconnect when taking them in and out of the case, and easily switch between my paired devices without problem. They do lack a lot of the apple ecosystem bells and whistles you get from a pair of AirPods or Beats, but that’s not Bose’s fault so I’m overlooking it. \n\n**Battery Life:** They have served me great and I’ve yet to have them die on me before I was ready. I’m not using them for all day shifts or anything, but their advertised battery life seems pretty accurate to me, maybe even conservative. The immersion mode does reduce the battery life, but not so much it’s caused me issues, and I usually have them in immersion mode. \n\n**Calls:** This is another field where a lot of early reviews said they were awful, but after having had a few calls, and asking how I sounded, nobody said I sound particularly bad. One or two did note I didn’t sound the clearest, but said it wasn’t enough to be an issue. I know Bose put out a couple firmware updates to address those early complaints and it seems like they succeeded. \n\n**Price:** This is the kicker, at $300, the cost is a big ask. And whether or not it’s worth it will really just entirely depend on your personal finances. I got mine on sale and only paid $240 (I also cashed in reward money and got a limited edition pair which were $375 full price. In the end I only ended up paying \\~$40 out of pocket) so I’m super happy with them and absolutely think they were worth it. If I had paid the full $375 - or even $300 for a normal pair however, I’m not so sure. They’re fantastic, but with them being priced so far above their competition, I definitely wouldn’t have bought them if they weren’t on sale. For the general consumer though, I think they’re a “buy on sale” set of earbuds just because of the price despite how good they are. However, if you happen to be rather wealthy and aren’t so concerned about price, they’re 100% worth grabbing. \n\n**Overall: I love them.** I strongly recommend grabbing them if you’re looking for a pair of open ears (or even in ears). It also doesn’t hurt that they’re rather stylish and kinda look like an ear ring. They sound great, feel great, work great, and stay in your ears great. The price is high, so I’d say wait for a sale if you’re more financially constrained, but if you‘re not, definitely grab them. ",

The back of the headphones is plastic and has picked up a few scratches over time.\n\nThese days I use headphones every day for commuting, work, and workouts, so I’ve been trying different models recently. After testing ones from Bose, Sony, Skullcandy, and Baseus, I’ve been using the XH1 a lot. The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ. It also folds easily, and the ear pads are soft and comfy. I’m not an expert, but it’s been a solid experience overall. ",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

I also wanted to explore all of these OG brands that have all these prestige having been a chifi guy.\n\nI picked each of these up £50 from eBay. K550 and ad500x. Sitting down EQ, pads and cable mod.

    "selftext": "There seem to be infinite claims about these headphones. From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

    "title": "Audiophile Verdict of Bose QC Ultra 2 Headphones: DO NOT BUY 1ST GEN!",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide. \n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs. \n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much. \n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones. I think it is because it has a smaller driver or its driver is not as tall.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Sounds muffled.\n* The soundstage is very small.\n* I hate it.\n\n\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1",

    "title": "Tried the HDB 630s today, was disappointed by the hype",
    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

The FT1 coming from some really good planar iems is an amazing leap forward for paying basically the same price. I ordered better ear pads, a capra strap. These will be the ultimate cans. Unfortunately the description on the graph site isn't detailed enough for me personally to truly understand so now we are here.\n\nI feel like the ft1's sound is very relaxing. The bass is phenomenal and very deep and visceral. The vocals are smooth. Treble is good for long term listening I'll say. But I feel like I can get a bit more excitement from these headphones. I listen to a lot of rap, a lot of female vocalist from all genres, house, dance, alternative. So bass is a common thing amongst all these genres. Boom, I added a bit more sub bass to give me some extra feelings. I've heard the sennheiser having amazing mids and since the ft1's are mildly v shaped, I raised the mids a tad bit. So I kinda eq'ed my graph to reflect the HDB 630 lower and upper mids and kept the rest the same. It's for sure, much more engaging vocally. I never realized how laid back vocals were. I will try the 6XX mids and see if I like it more. I know drivers play a big part in how sound truly is portrayed. But It made a good enough difference.\n\nNow I'm curious on some things I've noticed. What is the peak in the ft1's line around 1.8K. What is this specific frequency range responsible for. I also noticed the ft1's has a lot less treble in the 6-7K range than most cans. I felt like treble is the feeling I felt on my bones in the front of my face. I did notice raising this area was responsible for this feeling, that's maybe why these aren't as fatiguing to listen to long term. I'm a bit sensitive to treble but even the s12 planars I eq'ed like -2db from 6-7.5K and it was perfect. So I can for sure bump this area up a bit. It's interesting because my friend can use the dt 770's at high volume no issues. I could never lol. Those are some bright cans. I used to have em a long time ago that's why I have em on the graph for comparison.\n\nMy last question is eq'ing 8K or higher worth it and what immediate effects would I notice bumping this region?\n\nThanks for feedback, genuinely I'm such an immersive listener. I like to feel my music truly. If anyone here is a fan on the album Kiss Land by the weeknd. Arguably the most immersive album I ever heard. I'm very big on concept and immersion! even for video games.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nI’m starting up a YouTube channel where I talk about Hi-Fi gear, but from the perspective of someone who mostly listens to bass-heavy music: hip-hop, R&B, reggaeton, metal, all the stuff that doesn’t usually get talked about much in the Hi-Fi space.\n\nI’m not asking for buying advice or comparisons, just looking to get some thoughts from people here about what kind of topics or angles would be cool to cover.\n\nI’ve got a few video ideas lined up already:\n\n1: Intro to the hobby : kind of an overview of what “Hi-Fi”actually is, why it’s fun even if your playlists are full of bass-heavy stuff, some common misconceptions, and how EQ can really help shape your sound. Also sort of some intro recs on how you can get a great setup for the same price you could wait a pair of ANC headphones or even less. \n\n2: Wireless ANC headphones: these are where most people start with higher-end gear, so I wanted to do something that talks about that whole category and how it fits into the hobby, especially for people who like tweaking sound profiles and are into bass heavy genres. \n\n3: Talking about my own gear: I’ve got a few headphones I love (HE1K Unveiled, Meze Empyrean 1) and thought it’d be fun to share what I like about them, how they respond to EQ, and how to get the sound you want out of your own setup.\n\nI think there’s room for more content that connects the “audiophile” side of things with the kind of music a lot of us listen to every day, but isn’t really represented in reviews or general talk of the hobby. Sort of give my thoughts on finding the perfect balance of a good thump in the bass, and a super clear rest of the song which just makes the music feel incredibly natural. If you’ve got ideas for what you’d want to see in that kind of channel, I’d love to hear them!\n\nAppreciate anyone who takes the time to read, I’ll share the channel later once the first video’s up. Thanks guys!\n\nEDIT: one last thing, I speak Spanish fluently so I’m thinking of making a Spanish channel as well, if you’re here and speak Spanish and would like that lmk! Thanks! ",

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive.

    "title": "An Up-To-Date Review of the Bose Open Ultra’s",
    "selftext": "For the TLDR: They’re fantastic buds that I do recommend if you have the extra cash, but if they’re on sale, they’re absolutely worth getting. \n\n**Sound**: I’m not an audiophile, musician, or any sort of person that knows what they’re talking about when it comes to sound quality. So take my opinion here for the normie opinion that it is when I say I think they sound fantastic. I’ve always been impressed with Bose’s acoustics, their products just seem to fill the room or your world in a way I haven’t seen with other products, and these earbuds are no different - particularly with their immersive audio mode. Which makes them feel (I’m choosing the word feel on purpose) like in-ears.   \nRegarding the immersive audio, I think it’s incredibly cool. What it does is employ some acoustics tricks to make the sound like it’s coming from a source in your room. It’s *very* convincing and actually confused me at first when I turned them on thinking there was sound coming from somewhere else when it was in fact the earbuds. The “source” location is placed front and slightly above you so that it sounds like the sound is all around you but will stay stationary if you move your head (which really makes the effect pop). If you move your head and stay in the new position for a bit, the buds will move the source after a few seconds to recreate the “all around” sound again. The “motion” mode just makes the reorientation happen constantly so it’s always slightly following behind your movement. I’ve found myself mostly just always leaving it in motion mode even when sitting and only really putting it in still mode when I want to play with the effect. Switching to the mode does impact the sound, but its just as if the equalizer got changed and you can adjust it out with the equalizer. \n\n**The open ear design:** I’m a huge fan. If I want to block out the world, I have a pair of QC35’s. I use these for anytime I want to be able to hear what’s going on around me or just won’t want to wear a bulky pair of cans and the open ear design is fantastic for it. that said, It does have a noticeable drawback in that it’s easy for outside noise to drown them out. Higher pitched sounds like clanking and crashes are what are going to do it the most, and car noises on busy streets will make you have to turn them up a decent amount to still hear what’s you’re listening to clearly - particularly if you’re listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Personally, I think the trade off is worth it because it’s not a *huge* problem, but it is a noticeable one. \n\n**Comfort:** I have extremely sensitive ears, basically anything that is touching my ears will make them ache after a while. Even beanies will make my ears hurt. So I was absolutely thrilled to find that these earbuds provided a pretty significant reduction in discomfort compared to any other pair of earbuds I’ve worn in my entire life. They’re not painless, and the discomfort is moved to a different location on the ear because of their unique placement, but it’s still a pretty significant improvement and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve also never had them fall out or been even remotely concerned about it. \n\nThey are meant to be placed as close to the ear canal as you can get them, for most people, this will be at a slight angle downwards with the hook placed just above the earlobe, but you can place them pretty much anywhere in the “hook zone” which is anywhere between the lobule and start antihelix of the outer ear, so long as the speakers are inside the general concha (I hope I got the terms right I had to google ear anatomy). You can calibrate the immersion mode to however you’ve placed them on your ear so you don’t need to worry about sound quality reduction, but volume does get noticeably reduced and it gets easier for outside noise to overpower them as the speakers get farther from your ear canal. \n\n**Connectivity:** This is a field where early reviews of the product were rather negative, however Bose seems to have addressed the concerns in their firmware updates since release because I’ve had no issues. They paired easily, immediately reconnect/disconnect when taking them in and out of the case, and easily switch between my paired devices without problem. They do lack a lot of the apple ecosystem bells and whistles you get from a pair of AirPods or Beats, but that’s not Bose’s fault so I’m overlooking it. \n\n**Battery Life:** They have served me great and I’ve yet to have them die on me before I was ready. I’m not using them for all day shifts or anything, but their advertised battery life seems pretty accurate to me, maybe even conservative. The immersion mode does reduce the battery life, but not so much it’s caused me issues, and I usually have them in immersion mode. \n\n**Calls:** This is another field where a lot of early reviews said they were awful, but after having had a few calls, and asking how I sounded, nobody said I sound particularly bad. One or two did note I didn’t sound the clearest, but said it wasn’t enough to be an issue. I know Bose put out a couple firmware updates to address those early complaints and it seems like they succeeded. \n\n**Price:** This is the kicker, at $300, the cost is a big ask. And whether or not it’s worth it will really just entirely depend on your personal finances. I got mine on sale and only paid $240 (I also cashed in reward money and got a limited edition pair which were $375 full price. In the end I only ended up paying \\~$40 out of pocket) so I’m super happy with them and absolutely think they were worth it. If I had paid the full $375 - or even $300 for a normal pair however, I’m not so sure. They’re fantastic, but with them being priced so far above their competition, I definitely wouldn’t have bought them if they weren’t on sale. For the general consumer though, I think they’re a “buy on sale” set of earbuds just because of the price despite how good they are. However, if you happen to be rather wealthy and aren’t so concerned about price, they’re 100% worth grabbing. \n\n**Overall: I love them.** I strongly recommend grabbing them if you’re looking for a pair of open ears (or even in ears). It also doesn’t hurt that they’re rather stylish and kinda look like an ear ring. They sound great, feel great, work great, and stay in your ears great. The price is high, so I’d say wait for a sale if you’re more financially constrained, but if you‘re not, definitely grab them. ",

After 4–5 years of use, the battery isn’t as strong, and I’ve had to replace the pads twice. The back of the headphones is plastic and has picked up a few scratches over time.\n\nThese days I use headphones every day for commuting, work, and workouts, so I’ve been trying different models recently. After testing ones from Bose, Sony, Skullcandy, and Baseus, I’ve been using the XH1 a lot. The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ. It also folds easily, and the ear pads are soft and comfy. I’m not an expert, but it’s been a solid experience overall. ",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

I've managed to get that installed, easy peasy but, I cannot figure out how to get Curseforge to install in order to have Consoleport. \n\nIn the video I've been watching the guy goes to the Curseforge website, downloads it, extracts it and it's up and running... Not for me though. There's no extract option. \n\nSo I watch another, and he says you have to follow a direct folder path to place it into \"home/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata\" my problem is at the first hurdle, there is no .local folder for me to find.\n\nI've checked lots of posts and none really help. I've seen others that say try wowup.io... which is cool and all, but there isn't a consoleport add on there and they don't say what I should be looking for as a parallel.\n\nCan anyone at all, please help?",

    "selftext": "I found this out through using the SteamgridDB Decky plugin, Steam supports animated coverart and it looks amazing on the Steamdeck...but there is a catch. \n\nThe Steamdeck only has enough processing power to display a set number of animated art before it starts to run into optimisation issues. In other words, if you have multiple collections set up and you try to go to the collections tab you'll find the UI starts to slow down for a short while as it tries to display all of the animated artwork in the collection thumbnails. This also happens on the home screen but it's not as bad as it is on the collection screen.\n\nNow this isn't really a huge issue as nobody needs to have animated artwork, but at the same time I personally think it'd be nice if Steam added an optimisation setting that lets you pause the animated artwork on selected menus. I'd have it set so that animated artwork only shows up outside of the collections tab but also inside the collection folders themselves as those are the only areas where the lag is brief and not much of a hindrance.

However, as soon as I got into a car, I cannot accelerate/decelerate. As soon as I hit the right trigger, I enter vehicular combat mode and start firing off shots.\n\nAs soon as I checked my settings I saw the image attached (I tried changing to another layout, but regardless of what I choose, this remained persistent).\n\nI cannot figure out what the hell is going on and what is breaking with the controller layouts and the keybinds. If I hit right trigger in the menus, they work, but as soon as I enter a car, it doesn’t.\n\nMy keybinds in game are the default controller settings, which is fine and expected, but cannot understand what is breaking here.\n\nAny help would be sincerely appreciated.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI did remove `--launcher-skip` parameter I had (the only parameter I had) to launch the game from the launcher, which resulted in my settings being \"corrupt\" and reset to the defaults.

Won't recognize touch, or in controller settings. \n\nI only dropped the deck once, with a JSAUX modcase on it, from a couple feet. It was pretty babied. I think it may have happened after an OTA software update? I don't use the left pad much thankfully, so I didn't notice it right away. I have disassembled the deck before, and the ribbon cables look good, the daughterboards look good, I don't see any corrosion, water damage, or shorting. All the connectors are snug. I tried the \"load into bios\" trick as well with no luck.\n\nOnly thing I can think of is to try a factory reset, or a re-flash/flash a previous or beta nightly OS version. I contacted Valve, but they said they only handle hardware support, & since mine is out of warranty it'd be $125-175 to look at it. The other kick in the balls is they haven't released the OLED F7G model trackpads for parts sale, just the old LCD versions, which of course are different. I can't even find them on eBay either, so I can't just swap the stupid thing like I want to. \n\nAnyone have a dead trackpad on their OLED, & figure out a trick to fix it? Any help/advice is welcome.

It is mostly low settings, 800p @ 30 FPS with FSR set to quality. It overall looks decent on deck. Not as good as on an actual PC obviously but dino park building on the go is great to have. It only has frame dips primarily when first loading a park, and when putting down buildings, particularly large buildings. But in no way did it hinder my experience. Controls very well, though a little clunky making custom buildings. \n\nThe game itself:\n\nI'm confused because this has to be the least buggy Frontier launch I've ever played. It is for the most part solid with some minor bugs. The game itself is absolutely amazing and imo the new best in the series for the Jurassic World Evolution games. The customization is top notch, and as always you can build a family friendly T Rex exhibit. Overall 9 out of 10 for me I recommend it. ",

All my old chargers are capped at 15W and since I’ve got both a steam deck and a new S24 ultra, I figured it’s time to actually get something decent.\n\n\n\nThe confusing part is how much power do I actually need?\n\n\n\n\\- The deck’s spec says 45W USB-C PD 3.0, though in practice I hear it rarely pulls more than 40W. But anything under 38W is known to cause hiccups (restarting charge cycles).\n\n\\- My phone advertises super fast charging 45W but reviewers say it’s only a tiny bit faster than 25W in real life.\n\n\n\nSo now I am wondering if a compact 45W power bank is the smarter choice, something that can handle both my deck and my phone. I’ve been eyeing the INIU P50-E1 which is a 10,000mAh pocket sized bank that actually pushes 45W PD.\n\n\n\nHas anyone here tested 45W power banks with the deck? Does it perform the same as the stock charger or is it overkill compared to a 25W one?\n\n",

Now I'm facing a hardware issue, that I don't know how to deal with.\n\nI had played for a while, then switched to standby, connected the device to the charger, and saw the white LED light up. However, after 10 minutes I noticed that the LED was off.\n\nHere are the raw symptoms/facts:\n\n* The Steam Deck does not respond to pressing the power button at all (no beeps, no lights, nothing).\n* The charging LED does not light up when any charger is connected (including the original Steam Deck PSU).\n* This is an unmodified Steam Deck, running the original (and up-to-date) Steam OS from the Beta channel.\n* It has worked fine up until this weekend, I turned it into standby at a 19% battery level.\n\nThis is what I have tried so far:\n\n* Visually inspected the USB-C port - no indications of damage or blockage inside\n* Gently wiggle the connector to see if there's any loose contact - no LED or any other signs of life\n* The original Steam Deck charger works fine on my phone (reporting \"fast charging\")\n* Tested with different wall outlets and USB-C chargers, no difference\n* An USB-C charging analyser reports 0 Watt being drawn\n* Long press power button (up to 30 seconds) - no sign of life\n* I have removed the Steam Deck's backplate for a visual inspection of loose wires or faulty components inside - nothing visible from the back, but the charging port was a level deeper than I could access\n\nMy preliminary diagnosis is that there is an electronics defect inside the device, somewhere between the USB-C charging port and the battery. As a software developer, hardware issues are the most frustrating to deal with, and I'd hate losing my Steam Deck due to a single broken €2 capacitor...\n\nPerhaps I'm only looking to share my sadness, but let me ask these questions:\n\nHas anyone ever had a similar experience? Or a different diagnosis based on the above? Or any advice on how to get it diagnosed/fixed?",

    "selftext": "Hiya all, just wanted to post here to see if I could get some help and see if other folks have been experiencing this recently. My Deck has stopped connecting to WiFi, any WiFi service at all even after resetting my own modem and trying other connections outside of my household and will only connect via ethernet or hotspot off my iPhone.\n\nMy deck is a non-OLED model purchased before OLED was available and it's been working fine in general without many issues. The current update is one from I think around 2 weeks ago. I know earlier this year with an update - I think it was around May this year - there was a bit of a widespread WiFi connection issue that was caused by said update and I ended up using the solution most people here suggested at that time which was going into the developer settings and enabling \"Force WPA Supplicant Wi-Fi backend\" and that sorted out my issue at the time like it did for other folks. This time however when I go into developer settings that option is nowhere to be found under the WiFi section or anywhere else. The only option I have is to turn on/off the WiFi Power Management and even adjusting that setting - trying it both on and off - hasn't done anything to help.\n\nA new issue with the WiFi not connecting is also my Deck essentially gets stuck on the connecting pop-up menu, never actually connecting and after pressing cancel the buttons on my deck no longer work. Anything I press does nothing and I can only navigate the Deck using touchscreen until I force restart the Deck, as doing it normally from the menu just makes it get stuck shutting down but doesn't actually shut down, and the buttons start working again. All of this makes me think it's a bit of a bug going on so I'm just unsure if folks have found solutions for it or if others have experienced it as well as googling is largely bringing up posts from the May WiFi issues and not many super recent with the same specific similarities that I'm having.\n\nGoing to desktop mode and trying to connect to WiFi has also been unsuccessful as well :(",

I feel like I cannot physically make it, I cannot push through the pain, if I could end it tomorrow I would because I don't see anything worth fighting for, I just feel done. \n\nSo once again, I thank you all for your help, your attention, your support. The reason I fight on is for my family, but it's always for the family I've made here, but as I say, it's becoming too hard. \n\nAdd me on steam, I don't know how often, or whether I will be on, but I will try - 82871772\n\nI am on my discord a little more, you can find me there but again, none of you had to do anything, it's just been nice having you all around. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/X54M525Nq\n\nBeing stuck in bed the past few weeks means, wanting to play games my steam deck either can't or doesn't play well. \n\nSTREAMING! It's honestly such a way forward, wether it's Xbox cloud, moonlight or or Nvidia (I use Nvidia Ge Force and Xbox Cloud) \n\nIt delivers well, I get to play BF6 at 60fps on my deck or Silent Hill F, games with the anti cheat I can now play, it's super helpful. \n\nA little review :\n\nHalloween is my favourite time of year, my second behind Christmas.\n\nRavenous Devils - Heard of Sweeny Todd? Well it's basically that, you manage a Victorian pie shop downstairs and tailor upstairs. It's pretty much a simple click and do this, people come to see the tailor, you kill them drop them down to your wife who grinds the up and makes pies and Steaks. \n\nYou make money, make your system and equipment better and don't get caught! It's fun! \n\nI love games where YOU are the villain. And for 3.99 it's a solid great game that I had never come across before! \n\nThe Drifter - A point and click adventure I came along, you're a \"Drifter\" a homeless guy, an Aussie in Australia dealing with homeless people going missing in the night. \n\nIt's nothing new regarding the mechanics, but simply the story and VOICE ACTING it's phenomenal and again, whilst being cheap, it's scary in a real life kind of way. It's perfect for the deck and just great for when moving a few fingers is the least painful thing to do! \n\nThanks for reading (Apologises for the depressing part) \n\nLove you all. \n\nM\n\n\n P.S.

It also looks like firewall exceptions for SSH are already set up and it's not letting me delete them. \n\nIs this normal or could there be an issue with the download on the support pages? \nAlso how can I delete the firewall exceptions. \n\nIf you have a steam deck handy, could you go to desktop mode and check if this is set up the same out of the box for you, too? \n\nFor all my googling it seems SSH shouldn't be on by default.",

I need to know what could’ve even caused this?\n\nLast time I used it I shut steam OS down properly, I booted into windows 11 using my boot manager and shut windows 11 down. I’ve heard things that windows update can attempt to overwrite other partitions on your drive which can corrupt steamOS and trigger a reset. I’m not sure if that was my issue though, funnily enough windows 11 is still working fine. In fact it sometimes directly boots into it and ignores the boot screen, not all the time though.\n\nSo is this a windows 11 thing? If it is then it’s completely unacceptable from Microsoft and makes the OS unusable. I’m just annoyed I’ll now have to boot into recovery and sort the partitions out again. Has anyone experienced this issue? It’s been working fine for a good week or so.\n\nAlso side note, can I recover deleted files in steamOS? I know you can do it on windows using recuvra and such. I was playing dark souls 2 before the steamOS reset and it doesn’t support steam cloud.\nCan I retrieve these save files? I’m not using the OS at the moment incase I overwrite those deleted files.",

    "selftext": "So second attempt at dealing with my pain, firstly they wanted me just to go down the pain pathway, which would be finding medication that reduces the pain, but it only ever \"reduces\" it, and never to a point where I feel able to get up and out of bed, so after pushing the docs and collapsing a lot like last night, we have decided to remove some of my lower bowel. \n\nMentally I'm done. I feel like I cannot physically make it, I cannot push through the pain, if I could end it tomorrow I would because I don't see anything worth fighting for, I just feel done. \n\nSo once again, I thank you all for your help, your attention, your support. The reason I fight on is for my family, but it's always for the family I've made here, but as I say, it's becoming too hard. \n\nAdd me on steam, I don't know how often, or whether I will be on, but I will try - 82871772\n\nI am on my discord a little more, you can find me there but again, none of you had to do anything, it's just been nice having you all around. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/X54M525Nq\n\nBeing stuck in bed the past few weeks means, wanting to play games my steam deck either can't or doesn't play well. \n\nSTREAMING! It's honestly such a way forward, wether it's Xbox cloud, moonlight or or Nvidia (I use Nvidia Ge Force and Xbox Cloud) \n\nIt delivers well, I get to play BF6 at 60fps on my deck or Silent Hill F, games with the anti cheat I can now play, it's super helpful. \n\nA little review :\n\nHalloween is my favourite time of year, my second behind Christmas.\n\nRavenous Devils - Heard of Sweeny Todd? Well it's basically that, you manage a Victorian pie shop downstairs and tailor upstairs. It's pretty much a simple click and do this, people come to see the tailor, you kill them drop them down to your wife who grinds the up and makes pies and Steaks. \n\nYou make money, make your system and equipment better and don't get caught! It's fun! \n\nI love games where YOU are the villain. And for 3.99 it's a solid great game that I had never come across before! \n\nThe Drifter - A point and click adventure I came along, you're a \"Drifter\" a homeless guy, an Aussie in Australia dealing with homeless people going missing in the night. \n\nIt's nothing new regarding the mechanics, but simply the story and VOICE ACTING it's phenomenal and again, whilst being cheap, it's scary in a real life kind of way. It's perfect for the deck and just great for when moving a few fingers is the least painful thing to do! \n\nThanks for reading (Apologises for the depressing part) \n\nLove you all. \n\nM\n\n\n P.S. Drop me message on here if you want to talk to ask anything! ",

It is mostly low settings, 800p @ 30 FPS with FSR set to quality. It overall looks decent on deck. Not as good as on an actual PC obviously but dino park building on the go is great to have. It only has frame dips primarily when first loading a park, and when putting down buildings, particularly large buildings. But in no way did it hinder my experience. Controls very well, though a little clunky making custom buildings. \n\nThe game itself:\n\nI'm confused because this has to be the least buggy Frontier launch I've ever played. It is for the most part solid with some minor bugs. The game itself is absolutely amazing and imo the new best in the series for the Jurassic World Evolution games. The customization is top notch, and as always you can build a family friendly T Rex exhibit. Overall 9 out of 10 for me I recommend it. ",

But apart from some early Ubuntu 20 years ago (or more, maybe), I never experienced much of Linux and my memory of it was not the best.\n\nNow, it's such an awesome OS!\n\nI just bought a refurbished 27 inch, 1440p, 144 Hz, AOC gaming display in a really good sale.

I will now be sending my unit in for a THIRD TIME because they keep sending it back to me with new damage.\n\nThird picture is for reference from the Valve video for what they're supposed to look like.\n\nAnd before people ask again: yes, this Deck has the same S/N as the one I sent in the last two times.",

I wanted to say thank you to everyone who congratulated me in my previous post, it was very nice. \n\nTo be clear, this game is free, it has no additional costs, no paid DLC, no commercials, nothing. I simply wanted to make this game and now I hope people are willing to play it because there went a lot of work into making it. I rather see 100 players instead of 10 paid players. \n\nI started making this back in 2012, so basically it was more than 10 years in development. But I made it while I was studying and working.

    "selftext": "So second attempt at dealing with my pain, firstly they wanted me just to go down the pain pathway, which would be finding medication that reduces the pain, but it only ever \"reduces\" it, and never to a point where I feel able to get up and out of bed, so after pushing the docs and collapsing a lot like last night, we have decided to remove some of my lower bowel. \n\nMentally I'm done. I feel like I cannot physically make it, I cannot push through the pain, if I could end it tomorrow I would because I don't see anything worth fighting for, I just feel done. \n\nSo once again, I thank you all for your help, your attention, your support. The reason I fight on is for my family, but it's always for the family I've made here, but as I say, it's becoming too hard. \n\nAdd me on steam, I don't know how often, or whether I will be on, but I will try - 82871772\n\nI am on my discord a little more, you can find me there but again, none of you had to do anything, it's just been nice having you all around. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/X54M525Nq\n\nBeing stuck in bed the past few weeks means, wanting to play games my steam deck either can't or doesn't play well. \n\nSTREAMING! It's honestly such a way forward, wether it's Xbox cloud, moonlight or or Nvidia (I use Nvidia Ge Force and Xbox Cloud) \n\nIt delivers well, I get to play BF6 at 60fps on my deck or Silent Hill F, games with the anti cheat I can now play, it's super helpful. \n\nA little review :\n\nHalloween is my favourite time of year, my second behind Christmas.\n\nRavenous Devils - Heard of Sweeny Todd? Well it's basically that, you manage a Victorian pie shop downstairs and tailor upstairs. It's pretty much a simple click and do this, people come to see the tailor, you kill them drop them down to your wife who grinds the up and makes pies and Steaks. \n\nYou make money, make your system and equipment better and don't get caught! It's fun! \n\nI love games where YOU are the villain. And for 3.99 it's a solid great game that I had never come across before! \n\nThe Drifter - A point and click adventure I came along, you're a \"Drifter\" a homeless guy, an Aussie in Australia dealing with homeless people going missing in the night. \n\nIt's nothing new regarding the mechanics, but simply the story and VOICE ACTING it's phenomenal and again, whilst being cheap, it's scary in a real life kind of way. It's perfect for the deck and just great for when moving a few fingers is the least painful thing to do! \n\nThanks for reading (Apologises for the depressing part) \n\nLove you all. \n\nM\n\n\n P.S. Drop me message on here if you want to talk to ask anything! ",

It is mostly low settings, 800p @ 30 FPS with FSR set to quality. It overall looks decent on deck. Not as good as on an actual PC obviously but dino park building on the go is great to have. It only has frame dips primarily when first loading a park, and when putting down buildings, particularly large buildings. But in no way did it hinder my experience. Controls very well, though a little clunky making custom buildings. \n\nThe game itself:\n\nI'm confused because this has to be the least buggy Frontier launch I've ever played. It is for the most part solid with some minor bugs. The game itself is absolutely amazing and imo the new best in the series for the Jurassic World Evolution games. The customization is top notch, and as always you can build a family friendly T Rex exhibit. Overall 9 out of 10 for me I recommend it. ",

But apart from some early Ubuntu 20 years ago (or more, maybe), I never experienced much of Linux and my memory of it was not the best.\n\nNow, it's such an awesome OS!\n\nI just bought a refurbished 27 inch, 1440p, 144 Hz, AOC gaming display in a really good sale. Added a Ugreen dock and USB-C switch (like the old-days KVM interfaces) for my mouse and keyboard (to be shared between my 8 year old Windows laptop and the new Steam Deck \"desktop\".\n\nI set the external display as primary and set it to 1440p 144 Hz. Super crisp and fluid. But.... it has some stuttering and hiccups. I eventually reduced it to 120 Hz and it seemed more stable.\n\nFor those of you that use the Deck in a dock, as a desktop, what was the sweet spot for you in terms of resolution and refresh rate, for it to behave nicely?\n\nEDIT: not going to try and play at 1440p, guys, just to use it as desktop for browsing, office work, etc.",

(and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "selftext": "Christmas post… thinking about it already! I’m looking for a compact smart plug that sits between an outlet and a device. When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather). The fingerprint access is the reason I bought them at the time, and it rarely works (even when I reprogram the lock, it forgets my prints in a week or two).

I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

However, I was wondering (I don't mind purchasing equipment) if it's possible to replace the dumb 1 gang and replace with a smart 2 gang. The 1st light switch would activate the ceiling light (which I would change to a dumb bulb) unless of course there's a smart switch and bulb that work together but my understanding is there isn't?\n\nThe 2nd switch would activate the under counter LED strip (Yet to install). \n\nIs something like this possible at all?",

When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working on a project where I need to take gas pressure readings from four different locations and record them at intervals of 2-5 seconds.\n\nI initially looked for gas pressure transmitters and data loggers that can handle 4-20 mA signals, but I couldn't find a suitable one locally. Ordering from abroad would take months and be quite expensive.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about using four regular digital pressure gauges instead. My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

They are warm white with color temperature of 4700 Kelvins but I find them too bright for garden mood lighting. I read online that I need to consider the total wattage that the dimmer will support (e.g. if  I have two strings connected together I would need a dimmer that can support: 60 bulbs x 7 watts each bulb= total 420 watts) and that it's compatible with the listed 31 voltage, right?

    "title": "Need to upgrade Nest thermostat, have a couple other Nest devices and Simplisafe for security, should I ditch Google altogether?",
    "selftext": "We received an email from Google the other day that they will stop supporting our 2nd generation Nest Thermostat soon. They offered a discount for a replacement, but I thought it would be prudent to ask if it might be a good idea to switch ecosystems.\n\nWe have a Nest thermostat, doorbell, and camera for our kid’s room. We have Simplisafe for security (door sensors, window sensors, glass break sensors, and a smart lock). Wondering if it would make more sense to leave Google and go all Simplisafe? \n\nAlso open to an altogether different alternative if there is a competitor that can offer security and automation in one. It’s just kind of a pain to manage both ecosystems, plus paying for 2 subscriptions is not ideal.",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Help identifying Danfoss radiator valve types + correct adapters for tado X (Denmark, district heating)",
    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

    "selftext": "Christmas post… thinking about it already! I’m looking for a compact smart plug that sits between an outlet and a device. When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

(Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

I was wondering if there was any that will tell you if door is left open for a prolonged period of time. My dad is getting older and there’s been a couple times when a front or back door is left open when he goes somewhere and if I knew, I can call his neighbors and they will close it. If this isn’t the right place for question I’m sorry. ",

It’s all been working fine through Home Assistant and Apple Home, but I’m starting to feel the mess of having multiple bridges and protocols.\n\nSo now I’m trying to go “Matter-only” as much as possible. My next step is replacing the IKEA Zigbee shades. I came across Bringnox blinds that natively support Matter and connect directly to Apple Home without a bridge, which sounds like a good fit for where I’m headed.\n\nHas anyone here gone through a similar migration — especially with shades or blinds? Any tips on what works smoothly under Matter right now?",

However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

    "selftext": "My home has a two-gang box w/ two switches on the living room wall, and whatever used to be hooked up to one of the switches was disconnected before I bought it. We mostly use lamps with Hue bulbs in this room and I thought I could replace that dead switch with a remote to toggle a scene in my HomeKit setup instead of futzing with phones or assistants.\n\nThe Hue dimmer does what I want _technically_ but I would love something that fits behind a Decora plate. The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

Device management has become practically unusable — and all of this without any error messages.\n\n**What’s happening:**\n\n* Devices can’t be accessed, let alone deleted, renamed, or edited. The app just jumps back to the overview.\n* This affects all my essential skills: AOSU, Nuki, EuFy, eWeLink, Shelly, Tuya, Govee.\n* Newly added devices disappear right after confirmation — they’re not visible in the favorites or device list.\n* Favorites can’t be changed or saved. At times, I even get the message “Unable to load Favourites,” although they were initially visible.\n* No error messages, no logs, no response from Amazon.\n* After switching to a different Alexa account, the same issues reappear after a while.\n\nI suspect a cloud-side issue, since the behavior is identical across multiple devices and persists even after reinstalling the app. Other users have reported similar bugs — some going back weeks.\n\nAnd this is still the “old” Alexa — what’s coming our way with Alexa+?\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n* Has anyone experienced the same?\n* Are there any workarounds (e.g., via the web interface or voice commands)?\n* Has anyone tried bypassing the Alexa app entirely by creating a new, empty Alexa account and using Echo devices just as microphones/speakers for Home Assistant?\n* Has anyone received a meaningful response from Amazon support?",

Obviously I don’t want to sever power from the bulbs.\n\nI’ve searched a variety of different sensor switches, stand-alone PIR motion sensors, etc but can’t get to a confident decision on how to handle this.  I’m open to the possibility of using stand alone (small footprint) sensors to achieve an automation via homeassistant but I’d like to do it as simply as possible while still having a physical switch to activate the smart LED fixtures. \n\nI’m open to ideas",

    "selftext": "Is or has anyone else thought about doing this? Has anyone done it successfully? \n\nI'd like parts of my home to have lights turn on ONLY when there is a person detected. Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

(Some things are more comokicated but with enough time i can handle it) So i would love to have the visualisation over HA. \n\nBUT; What would be the best/easiest way to set up the rest/electricity? This should be more of an easy/straight forward thing. Should run when we move into the house. I can set the HA things later. \n\nI Thought KNX would be the way, but there are still a few disadvantages:\n\n- I cant program ETS by myself\n- I would like to have the main functions to work with KNX (heating, shading, lights, main door lock, garage door) to be controled over switches AND something like a Shelly walldisplay which should have all functions.\n\nSo my questions is:\n-Is it possible to control shading, main door lock etc. also over HA? (Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system. (Where I can do the normal stuff already when moving into the house)\n\nThanks for your advice!\n",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI have a garage door that can be opened using either a remote or a PIN code. Unfortunately, my kids often forget their PIN or lose their remote. I’d like to replace the system with a fingerprint reader instead. I know it’s not the most secure option, but honestly, having a remote lying around in the driveway isn’t great either.\n\nI’m looking for a simple, weather-resistant (lots of rain) fingerprint reader that can be managed directly on the device, via a web interface, or through an app. Ideally, it should also integrate with Home Assistant.\n\nThere are a lot of Chinese models on the market, but it’s hard to tell which ones are reliable. I’ve looked into Anviz. The P7 is still available locally but seems to be EOL, and the C2 Slim appears to be out of stock everywhere.\n\nDoes anyone have other suggestions or recommendations for specific models?\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue.

(Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

I'm creating a recovery drive this way, but I've got a feeling in my gut that for some reason it won't work since this is all on Windows 10? Same data, but different OS = Problem? I've got no clue.\n\nCurrently attempting that now but if it does not work this thread will be my last hope.\n\nIs there anything I'm missing? Any solution that I could try?\n\nI've been at this for literally 10 hours. So again, any real help would be immaculate.",

It happens on a fairly regular basis, like, once a second. I've been looking up guides, I've enabled and disabled devices, I've updated drivers and I'm about to try rolling back drivers, but absolutely nothing has helped so far.\n\nI also use it for music production, and I have a number of different virtual audio in/outs for that purpose, but even with those disabled and/or removed from the signal chain, the issue persists. I've turned both devices off and on again, I've disconnected and re-paired the headphones, I've used the app to check for firmware updates. The audio is totally fine playing music and videos from my phone, so it isn't the headphones themselves, and I normally keep the headphones disconnected from my phone via turning the bluetooth off on the phone, so it's not a cross-connection type of thing either.\n\nI think it might be something in a recent windows update? I just got a notification from the \"Compatibility Assistant\" saying that the REALTEK Bluetooth driver is no longer available with this version of Windows, but when I went to \"learn more,\" it sent me to the microsoft website \\*IN DUTCH.\\* I'm losing my mind at this, I don't know if that's what broke it or not but it's the latest lead I have on this, and I don't really know what to do from here in terms of going about fixing that.\n\nFor further reference, I have a \"OMEN by HP Obelisk Desktop 875-0xxx,\" with no relevant or recent changes to the hardware itself that would line up with this issue occurring.\n\nEdit: I rolled back to 24h2 and it's still busted, and I can't seem to uninstall to an earlier version than that.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys,\nSo I messed up. I ended up clicking some sketchy links when I wasn’t really paying attention (totally my fault). I didn’t think it was a big deal at first, but my Discord account got hacked and started sending scam crypto images and links to everyone. I managed to recover my Discord, so I thought that was the end of it.\n\nRight after that, I installed Malwarebytes and ran a full scan — it found around 25 threats, which I removed immediately. But then things got worse. When my PC was turned off, I got an email about suspicious activity on my Gmail account, and I was logged out. Then I noticed that my other Gmail accounts (which were logged in on the same PC) also received emails saying the email addresses for my Epic Games accounts had been changed.\n\nThe hacker seems to be from Turkey, and it feels like he still has some access to my system. Malwarebytes kept alerting me about a file that was repeatedly trying to connect to an unsafe IP address — it was located in my PUBG Mobile emulator folder. I’ve had that emulator installed for years without any issues, but maybe it was compromised or just detected late. Windows Security never flagged it, but removing that folder was insanely difficult. I eventually managed to delete it, but now I’m paranoid about what else might be infected or compromised.\n\nAt this point, I’m really worried about what the hacker might still have access to. My Epic Games accounts are still compromised, and I can’t change the email for 90 days since the hacker already did.\n\nSo I really need advice — how do I make 100% sure this person is out of my system? Should I reset Windows? Or do I need to completely wipe my PC? Virus scans aren’t showing anything now, but I’m still uneasy.\n\nAny help would be massively appreciated. I’m desperate right now.",

I've been taking photos of a lot of the information I've been running across and my biggest issue with trying to fix this isn't that there aren't options but that every time i try a solution it ends up not working because it looks like it's trying to use the corrupted files for the fix. Windows failed to fix itself when it found the problem, old recovery points don't load, using cmd prompt to get windows to un-corrupt itself didn't work. the boot errors keep trying to tell me this is a wire thing but why would it be given how the problem started? i messed with them a little anyways, it changed to sata0 dark blue for a bit but back to light blue once i put the ssd wires back to their original configuration. there's probably more I'm forgetting that I've done but I'm not that computer savy so unfortunately i can't remember it all, also memory checks failed.\n\nedit: i can provide extra details on request, not sure what would be needed to be included at this time.",

    "selftext": "At least to me. I'll try to be concise:\n\nMy internet connection seems to be unstable but only in tiny increments (my theory). **I am often unable to connect to services like PlayStation network, Spotify, Steam, etc. randomly; however simultaneously if I run a Speedtest, my connection is perfectly normal and my Wifi is up.** This is happening with my wired connection, too, as I tested an ethernet from the router directly into my Playstation and Switch and run into the same issue.\n\nIt's hard to replicate but I've noticed that once I'm connected to something, I have no issues. For example, on Playstation, I'll do a network test and either get a failure on the internet connection or the Playstation Network sign-in. If I start an online game (in this case, Battlefield 6), it'll usually give me an error - but when it *does work* and I get past the initial connection, I have zero issues. I can play the game for hours without any disruption and I don't lose any connection *even though my other devices will run into this problem connecting to outside services*, like Spotify having spotty (pun intended) playback problems until I take it off WiFi, and then it plays normally.\n\n  \nSimilarly, a streaming service like Netflix will have the same problem initially connecting, but once I'm in, I can stream everything without any issues.\n\n  \nBefore I go through the process of scheduling a technician to come out, especially because I can't replicate the issue purposely, I thought I'd ask here. Ideas?",

So I try the install but I get to 8% and then it fails and says can’t update the system reserved partition. I’ve been on a live chat with Microsoft support and they took control of my laptop and tried to make it do the update but it still didn’t work. I am aware there is a problem with version 24H2 so I am thinking of just waiting for a patch. The person from Microsoft went through command prompt and put a load of code in. Then he downloaded a setup file to go through setup again but that just bought up the system reserved partition again. If anyone could help that would be great. Also if you’re not going to be any help then don’t comment. ",

Then the problem got worse after resseting my phone didnt work so then i facotry reset my phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy A13, and I bought a brand new Amazon Basic 128 GB SD card for my phone. I put it in my phone, I formatted it, and restarted my phone. Then I go to move a game, and my phone says that the SD card is full. My phone has hella space free, so that's not the issue. I don't think the SD card is bad because I tested it on my computer and it works perfectly. I tried doing attrib –h –r –s /s /d E:\\*.\\* and CHKDSK E in the command prompt, and even formatted it on my computer. nothing. I think i really messed my phone but i dont know. Are there any solutions to this? or do i need a new phone?",

If i copy everything on the original to the bew drive, and rename that one to the same name, will everything still work? If not, how should i fix it? ",

The issue also happens with Battlefield 6 when attempting to log into the game servers at the start.\n\nError on Blue Protocol when disconnecting:   \nServer connection failed, please try again \\[50001\\]\n\nError on Battlefield 6 when connecting to the game when booted:  \nConnection Failed. Unable to connect to EA servers Please check your internet connection, make sure the Platform Client is online and try again. Please see [ea.com/unable-to-connect](http://ea.com/unable-to-connect) for more information.\n\nError code: 1:86001S:51002S:57019S\n\nWhen actually playing the games there is no lag or drop-outs at all, they all work fine until I have to use a loading screen theres the chance i just get booted back to the menu.\n\nWhen contacting ISP (toob) they said no changes have been made since the fiber has been installed and suggested I pay an extra £8 a month for a static IP to see if it resolves my issues which I would rather not do because it was working fine before.\n\nI'm really stumped on what to do here but if anyone has any more questions I will reply to them in the comments. Appreciate any and all assistance people are able to provide on this. Thank you.",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nAs of the last couple months my PC has struggled to play even simple games like Minecraft. My computer has an AMD 7700 XT and a Ryzen 7 7700X with 32 Gbs of RAM and a 970 EVO samsung ssd with a ASROCK b650I motherboard. My computer will drop to 2-30 frames when playing games that are well within its ability to play especially at 1080p. I have tried everything from checking drivers, looking at the components inside my computer and making sure everything is plugged in to messing around with the software side of things but I still have massive stuttering and low fps in almost all games I play. Additionally, I am unsure if this is a chrome thing but when browsing on the web these purple boxes will appear. It is smaller compared to some pictures I have seen of GPUs that are dying and it will only appear in a about 3-4 one inch squares on my screen but it is still an anomaly.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",

So I try the install but I get to 8% and then it fails and says can’t update the system reserved partition. I’ve been on a live chat with Microsoft support and they took control of my laptop and tried to make it do the update but it still didn’t work. I am aware there is a problem with version 24H2 so I am thinking of just waiting for a patch. The person from Microsoft went through command prompt and put a load of code in. Then he downloaded a setup file to go through setup again but that just bought up the system reserved partition again. If anyone could help that would be great. Also if you’re not going to be any help then don’t comment. ",

I even uninstalled proton just to be extra safe that didn't fix it.\n\nThis only started happening the day android 16 dropped a few weeks ago, but it started before I actually updated so idk if it has to do with that. But I've been connected to this network from my bed just fine for months before then.\n\nRestarting my phone fixes it very rarely, it felt like it used to help every time and now it almost never helps but that's probably just a misconception on my part.\n\nI think what's happening has something to do with 2.4g vs 5g, as it seems to be consistently flopping between these two.

Well, I'm not going to buy it if I can't test whether or not it works, first! Thanks.",

Is there any way to tell if it’s the charger or battery that’s the issue? I don’t have any special equipment nor do I have a similar charger.

    "selftext": "I'm reposting this from another tech support subreddit 'cause I'm still having the same problem and I haven't gotten any answers yet:\n\nI've got Sennheiser Momentum 3 bluetooth headphones, I'm on a Windows 11 computer, I've not made any recent changes outside of turning off telephony a few days ago to make my audio not suck when playing Helldivers 2, and updating my computer to 25H2 after hunting down the relevant NVME driver update, and now my audio keeps stuttering on and off. It happens on a fairly regular basis, like, once a second. I've been looking up guides, I've enabled and disabled devices, I've updated drivers and I'm about to try rolling back drivers, but absolutely nothing has helped so far.\n\nI also use it for music production, and I have a number of different virtual audio in/outs for that purpose, but even with those disabled and/or removed from the signal chain, the issue persists. I've turned both devices off and on again, I've disconnected and re-paired the headphones, I've used the app to check for firmware updates. The audio is totally fine playing music and videos from my phone, so it isn't the headphones themselves, and I normally keep the headphones disconnected from my phone via turning the bluetooth off on the phone, so it's not a cross-connection type of thing either.\n\nI think it might be something in a recent windows update? I just got a notification from the \"Compatibility Assistant\" saying that the REALTEK Bluetooth driver is no longer available with this version of Windows, but when I went to \"learn more,\" it sent me to the microsoft website \\*IN DUTCH.\\* I'm losing my mind at this, I don't know if that's what broke it or not but it's the latest lead I have on this, and I don't really know what to do from here in terms of going about fixing that.\n\nFor further reference, I have a \"OMEN by HP Obelisk Desktop 875-0xxx,\" with no relevant or recent changes to the hardware itself that would line up with this issue occurring.\n\nEdit: I rolled back to 24h2 and it's still busted, and I can't seem to uninstall to an earlier version than that.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I need help to solve a problem regarding the location of my laptop. My laptop is a Lenovo, and recently when I tried to activate my location to use a page that asked me for my location, my browser immediately did not respond.\n\nSo I checked the settings and it doesn't allow me to activate it since it says that my organization controls certain settings and won't let me activate it. I don't know if it's because in my main account there is another account of my school for the use of OneDrive. but I've also researched and the same thing has happened to more people, but I'm still not clear how they have solved it\n\nCan you help me solve this problem so that I can understand, step by step and everything I have to do? Thank you very much in advance",

I removed the third and fourth RAM, and the PC understood normally, I used the two RAM that I removed and put them in first and second, and it also worked, so I assumed it was the third socket, that's why I want to know a way to clean it, I think it is not making good contact.
