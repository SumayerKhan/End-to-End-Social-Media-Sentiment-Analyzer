And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Can't use app store due to unpaid balance",
    "selftext": "Hi! I was previously based in the US, but recently moved back to my home country. Unfortunately, I forgot to cancel all my subscriptions and one of my apps continued to charge my bank account even though I had already emptied it out (I was not able to close the account right away due to other reasons). As a result, I now have unpaid balance that I have no way of paying as I no longer have an American bank account, which in turn is preventing me from changing my app store region or downloading/updating any app. Would anyone know how I can resolve this? I've been trying to find a solution online but all the other issues addressed only cover a part or two of my problem. Thank you!",

He travels to Mexico a lot and it’s super frustrating because he’s even upgraded to AT&T’s highest plan thinking it would fix the issue, but nothing changed , still stuck on 3G. We’ve tried resetting network settings, restarting the phone, and following all the usual AT&T troubleshooting steps, but nothing helps. AT&T support just keeps suggesting to reset network settings again, which doesn’t fix it. Does anyone know why this happens or how to actually fix it?",

In the last month I upgraded to the iPhone 16 (running iOS 26.0.1) and I have had a lot of problems with the stereo screen jumping back and forth between Apple Carplay and Dual's local OS. My iPhone 16 does not completely disconnect because if I am playing music, it will continue playing even though Apple CarPlay is disconnected according to the screen. Even if I do not touch the option on my stereo screen for Apple CarPlay it will jump back and forth automatically between the Dual OS home page and Apple CarPlay.   \n\n\nIs this a glitch with iOS 26, or is my stereo system malfunctioning, maybe a hardware compatibility issue with the iPhone 16?",

    "selftext": "Hey, I’m not sure if I’m imagining things, but ever since I switched to the iPhone 17 Pro (I used to buy the Pro Max before), the new camera “plateau” design feels kind of annoying when I hold the phone.\n\nWith a case on, the plateau sticks out even more, and when I hold the phone or type, my finger constantly rests right under that raised camera area. It feels like my finger is being slightly pressed in all the time – almost like there’s a built-in Popsocket or something pushing against it.\n\nIt’s especially noticeable when I’m typing or trying to use it one-handed. My finger keeps bumping into that ridge, and it honestly feels uncomfortable after a while.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this or is it just me? Curious if this is a common thing or if I just need to adjust my grip or change cases.\n\nAnd if yes is the Pro Max different because I have \"longer\" fingers and the 16 Pro was okay but since the Camera Plateau it feels weird idk.\n\nBest Regards",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

Yes the transparency is still distracting in some places but I haven't found one that's particularly offensive yet. I like the new lockscreen, and to my surprise the animation actually felt more polished and responsive than iOS 18.

Like looking up stuff on maps, navigating a little, finding places to visit, looking for tickets, tracking a hike, … I lived the power bank life with a 3rd party MagSafe power bank on a 13 mini, and it wasn’t as comfortable as they make it out to be. \n\nNow the apple official one is different, I get that. It‘s more slender, and it behaves completely differently. It’s not always charging or creating heat. It’s really more of an extender. It communicates smartly with the phone and can be charged as if it’s part of the main phone. Apple doesn’t do enough to explain that properly in my opinion. \n\nHow is the pocketable feel? Does it still go into pants front pockets easily?\n\nIt also feel a bit unusual to already get a power bank with a brand new phone. When a regular could probably just easily get me through the day.

    "selftext": "I’ve seen a lot of people saying they returned the iPhone Air. So I thought I’d give my first-month impressions on it after returning the iPhone 17 Pro to buy it.\n\nThe battery life is great. Very similar to my 16 Pro when that was brand new. Zero complaints here. The fast wireless charging is also very fast. One of the biggest selling points of this phone for me was the screen size. It’s absolutely perfect at 6.5 inches - not too big, not too small.\n\nThe thinness of this phone coupled with the display size means I can comfortably use the phone one-handed. It’s still big enough to enjoy watching the odd sports game or TV show on it, too. I used to hate watching shows on my 16 Pro because the screen just felt too narrow.\n\nThe speaker sure took a day or two to get used to, but I’m absolutely fine with it now. No bottom speaker also means that I can lie the phone on my bed with the bottom flat against the bed without having a bunch of muffled sound, which is an unexpected but nice added benefit.\n\nThe single camera is great for me. I never used the ultra-wide, and I can't think of a time I needed to zoom in the last month, either.\n\nThis phone has made me excited to own an iPhone again. It’s been many, many years since I felt excited about using my phone daily! It’s a nice feeling. Sure, the Air isn’t for everybody. If you’re a content creator or amateur photographer, then do not buy this phone. But if you’re not, and value the bigger screen, the nice phone feeling, and you upgrade every couple of years, I think this phone is a no-brainer!",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

I hear you loud and clear, I’ll buy a dedicated work phone 🫡.\n\nOriginal post below:\n\n Hi, I’m not sure this is the right sub for this but I started working for a new company that has a BYOD policy for phones. If I want to download and log into Teams, access email in Outlook, or even access the company intranet in Safari, I need to install this device profile. \n\nAt my last workplace they didn’t have this requirement. I was able to install and sign into work apps like normal.\n\nI’m concerned about the fact that my work will be able to see all the apps I have installed on my phone and have the ability to factory reset my phone.\n\nMy work doesn’t provide company phones but for my job I’m required to be reachable after hours and will reimburse me for phone service after enrolling into BYOD. This makes me feel like after installing this profile, my work basically has custody over my phone??\n\nAny thoughts on if installing a company profile seems ok to you?? I am also thinking I might buy a cheap second phone to use only for work since they will reimburse me anyway.\n\nThanks!!",

Yes the transparency is still distracting in some places but I haven't found one that's particularly offensive yet.

    "selftext": "UPDATE: wow I didn’t expect this to blow up but thank you all for your comments!! I hear you loud and clear, I’ll buy a dedicated work phone 🫡.\n\nOriginal post below:\n\n Hi, I’m not sure this is the right sub for this but I started working for a new company that has a BYOD policy for phones. If I want to download and log into Teams, access email in Outlook, or even access the company intranet in Safari, I need to install this device profile. \n\nAt my last workplace they didn’t have this requirement. I was able to install and sign into work apps like normal.\n\nI’m concerned about the fact that my work will be able to see all the apps I have installed on my phone and have the ability to factory reset my phone.\n\nMy work doesn’t provide company phones but for my job I’m required to be reachable after hours and will reimburse me for phone service after enrolling into BYOD. This makes me feel like after installing this profile, my work basically has custody over my phone??\n\nAny thoughts on if installing a company profile seems ok to you?? I am also thinking I might buy a cheap second phone to use only for work since they will reimburse me anyway.\n\nThanks!!",

Everything felt slow and choppy and I don't care much about the transparency. Then today I bought an Airpods Pro 3 only to realize that it can't get software update and can't use many features unless it's paired with iOS 18 so I begrudgingly updated my iPhone 14 Pro Max to iOS 26 and braced myself for the same sluggishness on my iPhone that will annoy me more and more until I decided to upgrade my phone.\n\nTo my surprise, it wasn't actually that bad. Yes the transparency is still distracting in some places but I haven't found one that's particularly offensive yet. I like the new lockscreen, and to my surprise the animation actually felt more polished and responsive than iOS 18. I hope it really stay that way so I can extend my phone upgrade cycle to yet another year.",

    "selftext": "It's too much of a coincidence that ONEPLUS has not only downgraded the camera specs but also ditched Hassleblad partnership while OPPO is going all out with strong focus on camera and overall specs/features with the Find X9 series. Oneplus could have just as easily kept the same camera hardware in OP15 as OP13 which would have been good enough for 2026 with proper tuning but they didn't.\n\nAlso, from the display specs the focus is mostly on performance and high refresh rates now.\n\nOneplus flagships are known for VFM with balanced specs but from now on I think the focus is shifting towards to performance/gaming so basically it's minus -1 point from the camera department and +1 point in the performance department.\n\nI strongly believe, from now on ONEPLUS is likely to become a gaming orientated brand and OPPO will be the main balanced brand like IQOO and VIVO, POCO/REDMI and XIAOMI.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEdit: Appending the camera downgrade info below\n\nMain camera: LYT 808 → LYT 700 (same as Nord5)\n\nTelephoto: OV64B → JN5",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

I created an app that helps you to keep track of all your data in one simple place.\n\n# Download\n\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franko.privacyguard)\n\nI first released it 4 years ago, but Google removed it stating it violates the terms of use. Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "selftext": "Recently, I was searching for flip phone reviews and saw an article on the Vertu website. The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

Oneplus could have just as easily kept the same camera hardware in OP15 as OP13 which would have been good enough for 2026 with proper tuning but they didn't.\n\nAlso, from the display specs the focus is mostly on performance and high refresh rates now.\n\nOneplus flagships are known for VFM with balanced specs but from now on I think the focus is shifting towards to performance/gaming so basically it's minus -1 point from the camera department and +1 point in the performance department.\n\nI strongly believe, from now on ONEPLUS is likely to become a gaming orientated brand and OPPO will be the main balanced brand like IQOO and VIVO, POCO/REDMI and XIAOMI.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEdit: Appending the camera downgrade info below\n\nMain camera: LYT 808 → LYT 700 (same as Nord5)\n\nTelephoto: OV64B → JN5",

    "selftext": "you started to see some actions which knowing that google will block sideloading of non certified apps now make sense. \n\nAmazon is killing Fire OS, Fire OS is based in android 9 to 11 but they are replacing it with Vega OS on their streaming devices (which is absolte crap, its basically a OS for remote apps) and some appliances, while at the same time declaring that a new Amazon tablet will be out in 2026 with Androidn 16, meaning that that the main point of contention with Google was blocking sideloading so people could stop using their devices as general media devices instead of amazon media consumption devices.\n\nWe also had Oppo (and other BBK brands) Xiaomi and Samsung saying they would break away from the GMS ecosystem at some times, Samsung is the most advance with their accesories using Tizen instead of Android or Wear OS and having their own samsung pay service separated from Google wallet.\n\nso those details all coming togather brings us to looking it from 2 different points. \n\nAre the brands who make android based devices pressuing google to close their ecosystem and now that google has agreed we are seeing companies like Amazon allowing GMS in to their devices again (even if its just tablets).\n\nOr Google is using 3rd party vendors as an excuse to close their ecosystem, i know google  went from \"dont be evil\" to \"we are evil in person\" but i think this is a culmination of years of pressure from inside and outside google to become more like an iphone and close the system. \n\nwhats your opinion on the matter ?",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

Oneplus could have just as easily kept the same camera hardware in OP15 as OP13 which would have been good enough for 2026 with proper tuning but they didn't.\n\nAlso, from the display specs the focus is mostly on performance and high refresh rates now.\n\nOneplus flagships are known for VFM with balanced specs but from now on I think the focus is shifting towards to performance/gaming so basically it's minus -1 point from the camera department and +1 point in the performance department.\n\nI strongly believe, from now on ONEPLUS is likely to become a gaming orientated brand and OPPO will be the main balanced brand like IQOO and VIVO, POCO/REDMI and XIAOMI.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEdit: Appending the camera downgrade info below\n\nMain camera: LYT 808 → LYT 700 (same as Nord5)\n\nTelephoto: OV64B → JN5",

    "selftext": "Google Case no.: 4-1941000040097  &  4-4312000039720\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m extremely disappointed with how Google Support has handled my Pixel 7 battery swelling issue. My phone’s battery expanded, pushing up the screen — a clear hardware defect that many Pixel 7 users have reported.\n\nAfter multiple emails and days of waiting, Google Support said they would refund the amount only the battery replacement if done through their authorized service partner **CTDI (Aperia Mall, Singapore)**, but not other parts. This is unreasonable, as previous similar cases were covered entirely under warranty or goodwill.\n\nFinally, I had no choice but to accept the change of battery only, since my screen was still working. I brought my device to Google’s authorized service partner, CTDI. However, to my horror they **refused to replace just the battery** and **insisted that it is a policy I must also replace the screen**, the LCD cost about **SGD 200++**— even though the swelling itself caused the damage.\n\nThis feels like an outright **scam or cost-shifting tactic** — forcing customers to pay for screen replacement that resulted from a **known manufacturing defect**. Google should take full responsibility instead of making users pay for damage caused by their own hardware fault.\n\nI’m without a working device for 5days+, and Google took their time to get back to me despite countless chasers, the lack of urgency is very disappointing.\n\nAt the end of the day, \n\n1. I made wasted trips down to service center (wasted time and transport fare)\n2. Unnecessary aggravation - service center insist I needed to change both screen + battery.\n3. Still without a functioning phone after 5 days+\n\nService Partner, CTDI, did sense my frustration and took my phone in to escalate to Google, However this would be at least a 3 business days process (with no guarantee) + 2 days of weekend.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue recently?\n\nDid Google cover both the battery and screen replacement for you? \n\nIf you’re facing the same problem, please make your voice heard. The more of us report it, the harder it’ll be for Google to ignore this widespread defect.",

They declared the device lost/ stolen.\n5. After two more weeks, Google has yet to do anything.  I have contacted them multiple times, and they just keep telling me a \"specialist\" is working on my case and they can't escalate it any further.\n\nIt has been over a month.

Basically this is a motherboard issue and you have to either repair  the IC in it or change the whole motherboard. Most probably the repair guy repaired the IC in my device’s motherboard. So, just after 6-7 weeks from that repair my device’s OS became very buggy. At first, 1 or 2 apps used to crash for like a week or two. That means whenever I tried to open that app, it used to crash immediately and that app was inaccessible for a week long. After a period of time it used to go back to normal but another new app would have started to face the same issue. By time the issue got worse and number of apps crashing increased to a point where only a handful of apps was accessible. So, right now the whole phone is completely inaccessible and is stuck in the booting screen just as the attached image. The phone doesn’t go past this loading screen. Factory resetting might help in this case but I have a lot of important photos and videos in this device. Those are some of the most valuable memories of my life with my family and friends. I just don’t wanna lose them. Thats why I’m seeking help that if there are any ways I can recover my data or repair the phone without losing the data. THANKS IN ADVANCE.",

This is insane that it's October from a JUNE Pixel update release and they don't have a fix for Pixel 8/8p Wi-Fi. \n\nUpdate: resetting Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in repair mode seems to fix the issue! \nUpdate 2: The fix lasted a business day. Trying repair mode the second time has not worked (at least not yet). ",

As the smartphone was always used with a case, etc., it was in perfect condition apart from the reported fault (no other defects known, even took photos of it beforehand). During the repair process, I was informed yesterday that there were ‘audio problems’ and ‘frame cracks’, which would cost approximately 200€ to repair. However, these must be paid for, otherwise the display fault cannot be repaired.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a no-go business practice, as there was no visible damage to the Pixel other than the display fault.\n\nI have now requested a detailed damage report with photo documentation from Google, which I will forward to the European Consumer Protection Agency.\n\nThis will probably be my last Pixel.",

    "selftext": "I was just messing around with settings on my P10 Pro and I discovered an interesting setting. \n\nGames and emulators have been pretty meh on here so far.  Everyone assumed it's a driver issue.  And I think they're right because enabling something called ANGLE seems to improve performance and fixes compatibility for a lot of games.  Here's what I found:\n\nSettings-System-Developer Options-ANGLE Preferences (under Debugging).\n\nGo to the app you want to try and change the OpenGL driver from \"default\" to \"angle\".  Restart the app and give it a go.\n\n**My tests so far:**\n\nDolphin Emulator - Noticeably improved and more stable framerate in Star Fox Adventures and Metroid Prime.  These were both dropping sub-100% emulation speed.  After ANGLE is enabled, they haven't dropped below 100% speed.\n\nRunescape - Framerate and stability massively improved.  Graphical glitches disappeared.  Runs much, much better.\n\nsrceng (via idtech4a++) - Half Life 2 now works.  No more black textures, though there are some glitches still.  It was completely unplayable before this fix.  Portal unfortunately has a nasty flicker I can't seem to fix, but at least it runs now.\n\nOpenMW 0.50 - Seems to be quite a bit more stable with my modded setup.  Still some stutters here and there, but seems smoother overall.\n\nSubnautica - This ran ok to begin with, but it feels overall smoother and more stable with ANGLE enabled.\n\nI don't fully understand what this does, but I believe it's a translation layer between the GPU and Vulkan, translating each GPU call into something the GPU fully understands.  And since the PowerVR GPU drivers are currently buggy as hell, this fixes a lot of issues.\n\nI feel like this basically confirms a lot of the GPU issues are a driver issue (updated soon hopefully?!) since the translation layer fixes quite a bit from what I can tell.",

Basically this is a motherboard issue and you have to either repair  the IC in it or change the whole motherboard. Most probably the repair guy repaired the IC in my device’s motherboard. So, just after 6-7 weeks from that repair my device’s OS became very buggy. At first, 1 or 2 apps used to crash for like a week or two. That means whenever I tried to open that app, it used to crash immediately and that app was inaccessible for a week long. After a period of time it used to go back to normal but another new app would have started to face the same issue. By time the issue got worse and number of apps crashing increased to a point where only a handful of apps was accessible. So, right now the whole phone is completely inaccessible and is stuck in the booting screen just as the attached image. The phone doesn’t go past this loading screen. Factory resetting might help in this case but I have a lot of important photos and videos in this device. Those are some of the most valuable memories of my life with my family and friends. I just don’t wanna lose them. Thats why I’m seeking help that if there are any ways I can recover my data or repair the phone without losing the data. THANKS IN ADVANCE.",

    "selftext": "I feel like I’m going to lose my mind.  I have been having issues with RCS chats since I switched to Pixel 10 Pro.  Sometimes RCS chats will be working fine, but more often than not when I send a message there is only one checkmark and it says “Message delivers when contact is online…”  Support just suggested that I call that person to see if I received the message.  I have spent several hours chatting with Google Fi support which has been useless.  The status under the RCS chats option in messages settings has always said “Status: Connected” They sent me a new phone and it did nothing.  Here are some of the things that I have tried that have not worked for me:\n\n* Airplane mode>clear storage & cache for messages and carrier services app> restart>turn off airplane mode.\n* Clear cache & data for messages and carriers services apps\n* Delete e-sim and reinstall\n* Uninstall the messages app update\n* Manage my google account>personal info>phone turn off and back on, turning RCS chats off then on\n\nIn addition to all of this, now when I open a message from a friend who also has Google Fi, the app immediately crashes.\n\nHas anyone had this issue or been able to solve this problem?",

    "selftext": "Google Case no.: 4-1941000040097  &  4-4312000039720\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m extremely disappointed with how Google Support has handled my Pixel 7 battery swelling issue. My phone’s battery expanded, pushing up the screen — a clear hardware defect that many Pixel 7 users have reported.\n\nAfter multiple emails and days of waiting, Google Support said they would refund the amount only the battery replacement if done through their authorized service partner **CTDI (Aperia Mall, Singapore)**, but not other parts. This is unreasonable, as previous similar cases were covered entirely under warranty or goodwill.\n\nFinally, I had no choice but to accept the change of battery only, since my screen was still working. I brought my device to Google’s authorized service partner, CTDI. However, to my horror they **refused to replace just the battery** and **insisted that it is a policy I must also replace the screen**, the LCD cost about **SGD 200++**— even though the swelling itself caused the damage.\n\nThis feels like an outright **scam or cost-shifting tactic** — forcing customers to pay for screen replacement that resulted from a **known manufacturing defect**. Google should take full responsibility instead of making users pay for damage caused by their own hardware fault.\n\nI’m without a working device for 5days+, and Google took their time to get back to me despite countless chasers, the lack of urgency is very disappointing.\n\nAt the end of the day, \n\n1. I made wasted trips down to service center (wasted time and transport fare)\n2. Unnecessary aggravation - service center insist I needed to change both screen + battery.\n3. Still without a functioning phone after 5 days+\n\nService Partner, CTDI, did sense my frustration and took my phone in to escalate to Google, However this would be at least a 3 business days process (with no guarantee) + 2 days of weekend.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue recently?\n\nDid Google cover both the battery and screen replacement for you? \n\nIf you’re facing the same problem, please make your voice heard. The more of us report it, the harder it’ll be for Google to ignore this widespread defect.",

Disable battery optimization (important)\n2. Turn on precise location\n3. Clear the cache\n4. Force close the app\n\nDo this for all three apps. Then restart your phone.

Only the P10 Pro is capped at 4-5 Mbps.\n\nTroubleshooting Done:\nReset all network settings.\nDisabled Wi-Fi throttling in Developer Options.\nDisabled Wi-Fi scanning in Developer Options.\n\nNothing has worked so far. It definitely seems to be a software issue introduced with the update.\n\nOr is it a hardware issue?",

Basically this is a motherboard issue and you have to either repair  the IC in it or change the whole motherboard. Most probably the repair guy repaired the IC in my device’s motherboard. So, just after 6-7 weeks from that repair my device’s OS became very buggy. At first, 1 or 2 apps used to crash for like a week or two. That means whenever I tried to open that app, it used to crash immediately and that app was inaccessible for a week long. After a period of time it used to go back to normal but another new app would have started to face the same issue. By time the issue got worse and number of apps crashing increased to a point where only a handful of apps was accessible. So, right now the whole phone is completely inaccessible and is stuck in the booting screen just as the attached image. The phone doesn’t go past this loading screen. Factory resetting might help in this case but I have a lot of important photos and videos in this device. Those are some of the most valuable memories of my life with my family and friends. I just don’t wanna lose them. Thats why I’m seeking help that if there are any ways I can recover my data or repair the phone without losing the data. THANKS IN ADVANCE.",

    "selftext": "Google Case no.: 4-1941000040097  &  4-4312000039720\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m extremely disappointed with how Google Support has handled my Pixel 7 battery swelling issue. My phone’s battery expanded, pushing up the screen — a clear hardware defect that many Pixel 7 users have reported.\n\nAfter multiple emails and days of waiting, Google Support said they would refund the amount only the battery replacement if done through their authorized service partner **CTDI (Aperia Mall, Singapore)**, but not other parts. This is unreasonable, as previous similar cases were covered entirely under warranty or goodwill.\n\nFinally, I had no choice but to accept the change of battery only, since my screen was still working. I brought my device to Google’s authorized service partner, CTDI. However, to my horror they **refused to replace just the battery** and **insisted that it is a policy I must also replace the screen**, the LCD cost about **SGD 200++**— even though the swelling itself caused the damage.\n\nThis feels like an outright **scam or cost-shifting tactic** — forcing customers to pay for screen replacement that resulted from a **known manufacturing defect**. Google should take full responsibility instead of making users pay for damage caused by their own hardware fault.\n\nI’m without a working device for 5days+, and Google took their time to get back to me despite countless chasers, the lack of urgency is very disappointing.\n\nAt the end of the day, \n\n1. I made wasted trips down to service center (wasted time and transport fare)\n2. Unnecessary aggravation - service center insist I needed to change both screen + battery.\n3. Still without a functioning phone after 5 days+\n\nService Partner, CTDI, did sense my frustration and took my phone in to escalate to Google, However this would be at least a 3 business days process (with no guarantee) + 2 days of weekend.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue recently?\n\nDid Google cover both the battery and screen replacement for you? \n\nIf you’re facing the same problem, please make your voice heard. The more of us report it, the harder it’ll be for Google to ignore this widespread defect.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "title": "My long-term experience with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra (and why I still love it)",
    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion.

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

    "selftext": "I was a Galaxy user for about 10 years (starting with the S1 until the S7) and one thing that always drove me crazy was how my phones would slow down after a year or two. I eventually switched to iPhone with the 12 Pro, and 5 years later it still feels just as smooth as the day I got it.\n\nNow I’m considering going back to Android with the S26, but I don’t want to deal with the same old performance issues if Samsung hasn’t really fixed this.\n\nFor those of you who’ve stuck with Samsung in recent years, how does long-term performance hold up? Are they still prone to slowing down or is it finally on par with iOS for longevity?",

But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. \n3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. \n4.

And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed. I would like to have a simple play button (which would do AI wash) for my parents and my young daughter who I’m going to start to train to load and start. ",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

I really wish I could've found a good reason to keep it because I loved the flip factor, I can run with it and go hiking without feeling a big bulk bouncing around in my pocket. My main complaints were the short battery life and longer time to charge, camera quality, and phone temperature during regular use/charging (it gets really warm on the outter screen). Maybe sometime in the future Samsung will bring the Z series closer to the ultra given their higher pricing. ",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

I find the former more attractive but both seem to have similar activity and health metrics, which I'm more interested in.\n\nI'm swimming (pool and open water) and will start running; both not rigorously/competitive but for good health. I'm primarily looking forward to ecg and blood pressure as I'm lacking these in my current Huawei Fit3.\n\nMy question is: I'm currently using a Galaxy A55 5G. Will either watch lack any features when I pair with my phone, as I'm not seeing myself changing it for a couple more years. Are there some features (especially regarding activity and health metrics) that I could only have with an upper Samsung phone or a Huawei phone respectively? I know this was the case until recently but I couldn't find much info on these never models.\n\nAnd I know it comes down to personal preferences and tastes, but which watch would be better in my usage case?\n\nI should add, Samsung seems to release a non-LTE (only bluetooth) version in Turkey, where I live. So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

I don't want any black screen if I move my wrist, no shaking no nothing! \n\nThe only way this bloody thing stops turning off the screen when I move my wrist is if I have the screen on \"always on\". I don't want that. I want it to turn off after 30 sec that I actually chosed in the settings. \n\nI'm about to return this awful thing and go back to Garmin.

    "selftext": "Bought my GW Ultra late last year when they were giving insane deals/trade-ins and was blown away by how good it was.  However, over the last few months, my HR has been becoming completely unusable as the numbers would jump around so much that I knew they weren't correct.  (I've been a distance runner for almost twenty years so I know my HR very well and I knew the watch was giving poor info.)  I've had a couple of forced resets of my watch and even starting over from scratch has not improved things.\n\nFor my birthday last week, I got a gift card to Amazon and I decided to finally purchase a HR monitor with a chest strap.  Found an unbelievable deal on one for only $20 and thought I'd try it.  Today, on its first run, I saw just how bad my Ultra was really performing.\n\nIn the pic below, the top picture is the still very new Ultra during a 2.5 mile run.  It climbs steadily until reaching my \"cruising\" HR, which will usually be between 145-155, depending on my exertion level that day.  The top pic is very acceptable to me.  I was doing a lot of HR zone training back then and with a good HR sensor, it was easily accomplished.\n\nThe bottom pic is today's run, a 1.55 mile treadmill run.  (Sorry, it was 38 degrees and raining, so not going outside!)  You can see a very similar HR pattern as the new Ultra had in the top pic.  A steady climb into the cruising zone and stayed there for the duration.  Never got above 150 the entire time.\n\nThe middle pic is yesterday's run, one mile on the treadmill using the Ultra only.  Wow, what a disaster.  All over the place and a couple of minute-long flatlines.  Also, notice the high of 171, which I know my heart never came near.  Definitely a cadence-lock issue, because my running cadence is always between 168 and 174.\n\nI'm one of those tactile-intolerant people and I thought for sure I'd hate running with this strap on my chest but I barely even noticed it the entire time.  The beauty is, once SportWerks has discovered the BLE device, it is stored and it will automatically find the device every time in the future so as long as I remember to put it on, it's as simple as that.\n\nNot sure why these things simply \"go bad\" but apparently, mine has.  Sharing this because I've seen enough posts from other runners/cyclists to know they are also having HR sensor issues.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn17yc8ijxwf1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=91a25d27193cc4e24239c1554d50b2a76870b84e\n\n",

Ongoing tasks will appear in the Now bar at the bottom of your watch face so you can check key information quickly.\n\nDo more with double pinch  \nJust pinch your thumb and index finger together twice to scroll through notifications, control music, take pictures, and more. You can also customize what happens when you double pinch on the watch face, music controller, as well as alarm, calendar, and reminder alerts. Choose the actions you need most in each situation.\n\nMark reminders as important  \nMark reminders as important by tapping the Star icon. You can choose to have important reminders pinned to the top of the list to make sure you notice them.\n\nNew charging effects  \nWhen your watch is charging, the new screen layout and animations make it easier to check the current battery level and remaining charging time.\n\n**Stay connected**\n\nEasily respond to notifications and alerts  \nUse gestures to quickly respond to notifications and alerts. When a notification appears, you can double pinch to view the details or send a reply. You can also shake your wrist to return to the watch face.\n\nEnhanced notification view  \nNotifications on your watch are now easier to use with an attractive new design. Notifications from the same app are stacked vertically, allowing you to view more notifications with fewer swipes.\n\nSmarter notification settings  \nIt's now easier to decide how to receive notifications from your phone on your watch. If you choose Smart device selection, notifications will appear on your phone only when you're using it and on your watch when you're not using your phone. If you choose Always show on both, notifications will always appear on both your phone and watch.\n\n**Upgrade your health**\n\nRunning coach  \nWhether you're a beginner or an experienced runner, the new Running coach feature in Samsung Health provides personalized training programs and tips to help you run farther and faster while minimizing the risk of injury.\n\nBedtime guidance  \nGet to sleep at the right time so you wake up feeling refreshed. The new Bedtime guidance feature analyzes your sleep data and recommends the best time to go to sleep each night.\n\nMindfulness  \nManage stress and anxiety in your daily life with the new Mindfulness feature in Samsung Health. You can keep track of your moods and emotions and practice breathing exercises to reduce stress.\n\n**Tailored to you**\n\nFind the perfect watch face  \nIt's now easier to find the watch face that's right for you. Just choose a few keywords such as your preferred style, color, and information to show. The best matches will be suggested from our collection of more than 300 watch faces.\n\nRecommended watch faces  \nDiscover new watch faces that you might like. Watch faces with colors, style, or information similar to your current watch face will be recommended on the watch face selection screen.\n\nCreate your own tiles  \nCreate your own custom tiles that show the information you need. You can even combine information from different apps into a single tile. You can include weather information, calendar events, reminders, and more.\n\nPersonalized Apps screen  \nFeatured apps now appear at the top of your Apps screen to give you quick access to the apps you need the most. Apps will be featured based on how often you use them and other usage patterns. You can also view your apps as a list with names instead of only icons.\n\nChoose calendars to show on your watch  \nYou can now choose which calendars to show in the Calendar app on your watch. You can show all of the same calendars that are on your phone or customize to show only the calendars you need.\n\n  \n**Sadly there are no any:**\n\n  \nTrack your vascular load  \nUse your Galaxy Watch to measure your vascular load, which is the amount of stress on your blood vessels. First, take a baseline measurement, then you'll be able to see when your vascular load gets higher or lower over time.  \n  \nCheck your antioxidant intake  \nThe Antioxidant index (Labs) feature on your watch detects the level of carotenoids in your skin. Carotenoids are a type of antioxidant contained in fruits and vegetables that can help prevent physical aging.\n\nP.S. It's not bad update overall, but most important features as always Samsung hold just for Ultra models.",

Not everyone is into spending hundreds on a Smartwatch or Ring.\n\n\\-It has great battery life.  I'm fine with the shorter battery life of my Watch 7, but I know that none of these people I set up with a Fit 3 would put up with having to charge their watch every 1-2 days.\n\n\\-It's not bulky.  I don't consider my Watch 7 bulky either, certainly not compared to something like a Watch Ultra, but the Fit 3 is a truly lightweight device.\n\n\\-Has all the basic smartwatch features covered.  I'm amazed how well it integrates with Google Messages when receiving texts.  It's great that it still shows you when you are getting a call (even though you can't answer them).  It handles all the core health tracking.  Built-in find-your-phone feature, fall alerts, etc.\n\n\\-Low maintenance.  No apps that need to update constantly.  The Fit 3 itself turns on and off very quick.  This also makes it a great backup watch.  My old Watch 4 Classic on the other-hand, I have to turn it on periodically just to keep the apps updated and it takes a while, uses maybe 10% of the battery just finishing the boot-up process.\n\n  \nNow obviously each watch has it's own pros and cons, but the Fit 3 does a really great job at not just being a cheap watch, but actually doing certain things better than the more expensive watches and creating a great option to bring a big group of people into the Samsung smartwatch / Samsung health ecosystem.",

There I enter my credentials, complete 2FA and I get a screen saying:\n\nContinue with ********@*****.com\n\nApplicable service: Samsung Health\n\nContinue\n\nCancel\n\nI tap continue, and I am momentarily taken back to the Samsung Health app, I see a glimpse of something loading, and then I am taken back to the browser to the same \"Continue with ... \" screen, and then none of the two options to continue or to cancel work (I mean I tap them and they do nothing). If I go back to Samsung Health, the loading circle spins indefinitely and I actually have to close the app and I need to close it then open it up again, and then the cycle repeats.\n\nWhile I am still able to use my watch through the Galaxy Wearable app, this issue is severely impacting my experience, as I am basically blocked from using basic health features.\n\nI've tried all the usual troubleshooting steps: Clearing cache and data of Samsung Health, reinstalling Samsung Health, downloading, using a different browser (Samsung Internet instead of Google Chrome), restarting the phone. I am using a Redmi Note 12 running HyperOS 2.\n\nIf someone has any idea how to fix that, any help would be much appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "This is a post to help you folks who are stuck with a watch that dies in 8 hours.\n\nBefore I start, let me just clarify that I don't have a fixed solution for you. I'll tell you what I tried, and what worked.\n\nI got my galaxy watch 8c LTE edition on September 13th. Bought it from a store, enabled whatever I wanted, used it.\nIt took me a couple of days to realize that the battery dies within the day.\n\nI started measuring. I was wearing it to sleep, I was using it to exercise, I was using it like how a proper smart watch is supposed to be used. On an average I got 10-12 hours out of it. 10% battery drain per hour.\n\nI started looking into solutions. Searched reddit, forums, samsung issue resolutions.\n\nSome had this issue because of the Gemini constantly listening. Some had it because they had AOD on. But these folks already had a battery life that spanned atleast 20+ hours. This fix wasn't for me.\n\nThen the next group of people had a solution - clear the cache partition or do a factory reset. Or do both.\nFor some, the cache clear worked. For some the reset did. For some, doing both did it.\n\nSo started my 2 week long experimenting on improving battery life.\n\nClearing cahe partition didn't do much. I cleared again. Nothing.\nI reset the watch. Still showed 12 hours.\n\nSomeone pointed out to do it twice - no idea why - but tried that.\nStill the same.\n\nAfter 3 days of trial and error, my watch suddenly showed 22hrs.\nI didn't do anything much. I had cleared the partition and reset the watch earlier that day.\n\nHoping it would improve again, I repeated this process - twice.\nAfter setting it up as a new watch for God knows how many times, it switched back to showing 12-15h.\n\nHere is when I noticed that the battery drain has a direct correlation with the network settings.. \nI checked my connection settings - wifi, mobile data etc were set to auto. That would mean that when my phone was away, they would use what's needed and would be off when I'm using it with my phone nearby. \n\nBut it seemed that the watch was not turning it off. It was connected to my watch, but not always through bluetooth. It would switch sometimes to wifi and LTE even when the phone was in my pocket. \n\nThis was the root cause. Don't know what caused it, but my samsung phone was not exactly paired to my samsung watch.\n\nI cleared cache partition. That didn't do much. I hard reset the watch multiple times till I ensured it was pairing properly.\n\nAnd immediately I got 1day+12 hours battery life. That's the same amount as promised by samsung with everything on.\n\nAll you have to do is just check if only bluetooth is enabled on the watch menu while your phone is near.\n\nDo some hard resets, clear cache - as many times as needed to ensure only bluetooth icon is visible when phone is near. The wifi and LTE symbols should be off if you're normally wearing your watch. Update your settings to auto. This will get you 1.5 days of battery life with AOD off. If you need more than 36 hours of battery life, then do the things others did - turn off AOD, switch off Gemini, set heart rate to measure every 10 mins etc. that's gonna get u that 2 day battery life.\n\n I still don't know why or what's causing it. Maybe my phone has too many bluetooth devices connected to it. Maybe my watch hates my phone in secret. Who knows. But this should fix it.\n\ntldr; read last 3 paragraphs. Good luck.\n\nPS : not a native English speaker. Sorry for the language.\n\n",

The 40mm fits better on my wrist but if i would cancel my order id have to pay 339€ instead of the 259 i wouldve payed for the watch. Ive got quite a slim wrist and now my question is, would the 44mm would fit good if i would use other bands then the Standard one? I ofc i like the 44mm better because it has more battery and a bigger screen tho, the 40mm looks better on my wrist but if it still wouldnt fit better with other bands i might have to pay 80€ more to get the 40mm at standard price :( please let me know if anyone ever encounterd this problem",

I'm primarily looking forward to ecg and blood pressure as I'm lacking these in my current Huawei Fit3.\n\nMy question is: I'm currently using a Galaxy A55 5G. Will either watch lack any features when I pair with my phone, as I'm not seeing myself changing it for a couple more years. Are there some features (especially regarding activity and health metrics) that I could only have with an upper Samsung phone or a Huawei phone respectively? I know this was the case until recently but I couldn't find much info on these never models.\n\nAnd I know it comes down to personal preferences and tastes, but which watch would be better in my usage case?\n\nI should add, Samsung seems to release a non-LTE (only bluetooth) version in Turkey, where I live. So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

    "selftext": "Bought my GW Ultra late last year when they were giving insane deals/trade-ins and was blown away by how good it was.  However, over the last few months, my HR has been becoming completely unusable as the numbers would jump around so much that I knew they weren't correct.  (I've been a distance runner for almost twenty years so I know my HR very well and I knew the watch was giving poor info.)  I've had a couple of forced resets of my watch and even starting over from scratch has not improved things.\n\nFor my birthday last week, I got a gift card to Amazon and I decided to finally purchase a HR monitor with a chest strap.  Found an unbelievable deal on one for only $20 and thought I'd try it.  Today, on its first run, I saw just how bad my Ultra was really performing.\n\nIn the pic below, the top picture is the still very new Ultra during a 2.5 mile run.  It climbs steadily until reaching my \"cruising\" HR, which will usually be between 145-155, depending on my exertion level that day.  The top pic is very acceptable to me.  I was doing a lot of HR zone training back then and with a good HR sensor, it was easily accomplished.\n\nThe bottom pic is today's run, a 1.55 mile treadmill run.  (Sorry, it was 38 degrees and raining, so not going outside!)  You can see a very similar HR pattern as the new Ultra had in the top pic.  A steady climb into the cruising zone and stayed there for the duration.  Never got above 150 the entire time.\n\nThe middle pic is yesterday's run, one mile on the treadmill using the Ultra only.  Wow, what a disaster.  All over the place and a couple of minute-long flatlines.  Also, notice the high of 171, which I know my heart never came near.  Definitely a cadence-lock issue, because my running cadence is always between 168 and 174.\n\nI'm one of those tactile-intolerant people and I thought for sure I'd hate running with this strap on my chest but I barely even noticed it the entire time.  The beauty is, once SportWerks has discovered the BLE device, it is stored and it will automatically find the device every time in the future so as long as I remember to put it on, it's as simple as that.\n\nNot sure why these things simply \"go bad\" but apparently, mine has.  Sharing this because I've seen enough posts from other runners/cyclists to know they are also having HR sensor issues.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn17yc8ijxwf1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=91a25d27193cc4e24239c1554d50b2a76870b84e\n\n",

I bought an expensive (for me at least) watch8 classic because it looks like a classic watch and I want it to behave like one as well. I don't want any black screen if I move my wrist, no shaking no nothing! \n\nThe only way this bloody thing stops turning off the screen when I move my wrist is if I have the screen on \"always on\". I don't want that. I want it to turn off after 30 sec that I actually chosed in the settings. \n\nI'm about to return this awful thing and go back to Garmin. I'm so frustrated. \n\nIf someone can help me with this I would be forever grateful. ",

Not everyone is into spending hundreds on a Smartwatch or Ring.\n\n\\-It has great battery life.  I'm fine with the shorter battery life of my Watch 7, but I know that none of these people I set up with a Fit 3 would put up with having to charge their watch every 1-2 days.\n\n\\-It's not bulky.  I don't consider my Watch 7 bulky either, certainly not compared to something like a Watch Ultra, but the Fit 3 is a truly lightweight device.\n\n\\-Has all the basic smartwatch features covered.  I'm amazed how well it integrates with Google Messages when receiving texts.  It's great that it still shows you when you are getting a call (even though you can't answer them).  It handles all the core health tracking.  Built-in find-your-phone feature, fall alerts, etc.\n\n\\-Low maintenance.  No apps that need to update constantly.  The Fit 3 itself turns on and off very quick.  This also makes it a great backup watch.  My old Watch 4 Classic on the other-hand, I have to turn it on periodically just to keep the apps updated and it takes a while, uses maybe 10% of the battery just finishing the boot-up process.\n\n  \nNow obviously each watch has it's own pros and cons, but the Fit 3 does a really great job at not just being a cheap watch, but actually doing certain things better than the more expensive watches and creating a great option to bring a big group of people into the Samsung smartwatch / Samsung health ecosystem.",

I find the former more attractive but both seem to have similar activity and health metrics, which I'm more interested in.\n\nI'm swimming (pool and open water) and will start running; both not rigorously/competitive but for good health. I'm primarily looking forward to ecg and blood pressure as I'm lacking these in my current Huawei Fit3.\n\nMy question is: I'm currently using a Galaxy A55 5G. Will either watch lack any features when I pair with my phone, as I'm not seeing myself changing it for a couple more years. Are there some features (especially regarding activity and health metrics) that I could only have with an upper Samsung phone or a Huawei phone respectively? I know this was the case until recently but I couldn't find much info on these never models.\n\nAnd I know it comes down to personal preferences and tastes, but which watch would be better in my usage case?\n\nI should add, Samsung seems to release a non-LTE (only bluetooth) version in Turkey, where I live. So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently undecided between two laptops and could use some advice. I don’t know much about the detailed specs of the laptops, and I won’t be using them purely for gaming — I also plan to use them for hobbies like music production and video creation. I also have sensitive eyes, so long screen sessions can be uncomfortable for me.\n\nOption 1: MONSTER TULPAR T6 V3.7.5 •\tIntel Core i9-13900HX •\t32GB RAM •\t1TB SSD •\tRTX 5070 Ti •\tQHD display\n\nOption 2: MSI VECTOR 16 HX AI A2XWHG-091XTR •\tIntel Core Ultra 7-155HX (assuming it’s 155HX, not 255HX?) •\t16GB DDR5 •\t1TB SSD •\tGeForce RTX 5070 Ti 12GB 140W •\t16” FHD+ 144Hz display •\tFreeDOS\n\nOne thing I noticed online is that the MSI tends to get quite loud on turbo fan mode. In my country, these two are currently the best options available in this price range. The Monster has a QHD screen, while the MSI has an FHD one. Other than that, there doesn’t seem to be a huge difference.\n\nThere’s about a $350 price difference, but it’s not a big deal for me. The Monster is slightly more expensive, but the prices are pretty close. Visually, the MSI has a more attractive design.\n\nAny thoughts on which one would be the better choice overall (build quality, thermals, display, long-term reliability, etc.)?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I have been using the same $50 laptop I bought used from my dad's job for maybe two years and It's served me well, but it very visibly and physically is giving up. She's nearly ten years old and a bit roughed up outside, she always has to be charged and runs out of battery fully charged in around an hour, even with the best battery setting and brightness down fully. The keyboard locks sometimes and you have to tap until it goes back into place. It's also extremely slow, so much that even good WIFI doesn't give it much of a boost. \n\n  \n(**Now for the real info!**)\n\nI'd like a laptop with good storage, decent RAM (*32 RAM is most preferred due to what I do)*, I do not care much about the touchpad size as long as it doesn't lock up cause I've had really annoying mishaps in the past of keyboard/touchpad jamming, I'd also like a laptop with a screen length of at least 14 inches (*I don't mind a bulky laptop if it runs well*), I don't care much either if it looks it bit non aesthetically pleasing cause I will get a carrying case and don't care how 'good' a laptop looks, a good quality graphics card (*I enjoy watching movies and playing videogames with good quality*), really reliable because I can't handle a crash. This will mainly be used for school (*uploading documents, watching course videos, working on projects, having several tabs open at once to multitask while still working well*) and playing videogames. (*Think Fallout, Slime Rancher, Resident Evil, Cyberpunk, etc*) \n\nThank you in advance!",

And why does it seem to randomly / suddenly occur?\n\nI.e are drivers faulty? Are there defects in the battery? Has the hardware been damaged in some way? Or a mix of all the above?\n\nHonestly just curious, no pressure for anyone to answer and no worries if no one really knows.\n\n",

To increase compatibility? Or am I just stuck like this? \nThanks in advance!",

I use the laptop for a month and a half taking care of it and being very careful with it during a presentation I have at work the laptop screen goes off and the caps lock starts blinking 5 long, 3 short. I get frustrated especially since its brand new but im like okay shit happens whatever. My main issue is when I took the laptop to the repair they told me the motherboard is messed up and they couldn't find a single motherboard out of the 100s they have that fit into my laptop, and tell me that HP is making laptops that cant be fixed. Now im left with a brand new laptop thats for the bin and a huge amount of work piled up, with the cheapest good laptops being 600 to 700. What a waste man",

    "title": "What laptop should I buy?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I’m planning to buy a new laptop soon, and I could really use some advice before making the final decision. My budget is around **$600 USD** or less, and I’m looking for a laptop that performs well, looks good, and works smoothly for daily tasks. I mainly need it for **work**, which involves a lot of **video calls**, so a decent **built-in webcam** is actually one of my top priorities. I also tend to have multiple apps and browser tabs open at once, so smooth **multitasking** is really important to me.\n\nOutside of work, I’d like the laptop to handle some casual gaming from time to time. It would be nice if it could run a few games comfortably without overheating or lagging. I also spend a fair amount of time streaming shows and videos, editing documents and presentations, and maybe doing some basic photo or video editing here and there when needed. Overall, I’m looking for a laptop that can handle everyday tasks with ease while still being enjoyable and comfortable to use.\n\nI’ve already done a bit of research and found a few models that seem to fit my needs, but I’m still not sure which one offers the best overall value. I’ll list them below with their prices, along with some quick notes on what I’ve found so far, but I’d love to hear your thoughts or any recommendations you might have.\n\n**$450 USD Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15IAH8**\\- 15.6\" FHD (TN, 250 nits) Intel Core i5-12450H (8 cores, 12 threads), 8GB (soldered) DDR5, 512GB SSD M.2 2242, 1080p Webcam, WiFi 6 , Bluetooth 5.2 , Windows 11 Home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the laptop's material feels cheap, it gets hot quickly, and the battery doesn't last long. It also struggles with gaming and can shut down randomly. While positive reviews say the image quality and Dolby audio are decent, and the camera is great for video calls. The performance is acceptable for work and school. It opens programs fast and charges quickly.\n\nThe second laptop is the same Lenovo laptop but it's the one with an **AMD Ryzen 5 7520U** processor, it does have some other differences so these are the full specs: AMD Ryzen 5 7520U (4C/8T, 2.8/4.3GHz, 2MB L2/4MB L3) 16GB RAM | 512GB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe | 15.6\" matte screen | Windows 11 Home (and Pro on another site). Camera: HD 720p with a privacy shutter.\n\nNegative reviews say that the display isn’t very bright, that it lacks touch functionality, and that the colors have a slight greenish tint. They trash the webcam, saying it's only 720p and not great. The hinge goes all the way back, and the keyboard isn’t backlit. The fan can get noisy during gameplay too.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has an impressive battery life, lasting about 10-11 hours with regular use. The 1080p display is decent, and the built-in speakers sound pretty good. The keyboard is snappy, and the large trackpad is accurate. It has a fingerprint reader for extra security, and you can even open the laptop with one hand.\n\n**$550 Acer Aspire Lite** 15.6\" FHD, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 8 cores Windows 11 Home | integrated AMD Radeon Graphics. DDR4 3200 MHz M.2 PCLE NVMe.\n\nAccording to some reviews, the battery life isn't that good, like 4-5 hours. This is the laptop that the sales clerk recommended. They said the camera quality is decent (like a normal one you would get at this price range).\n\n**$530 ASUS Vivobook Go 15** | AMD Ryzen 5 7520U | 16GB | 512GB SSD | 15.6\" | Windows 11 Home | 2.8GHz (6MB Cache, up to 4.3GHz, 4 cores, 8 Threads) FHD 60 Hz AMD Radeon Web Camera 720p.\n\nNegative reviews say that the fans are slightly loud. It's not suitable for video and photo editing. The webcam is mediocre, not the best one, basically.\n\nPositive reviews say that the battery lasts 7 hours and it charges fully in 1 hour. One review even said that the webcam quality was decent enough.\n\n**$550 ASUS Vivobook 15** AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 16 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM 512 GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD 8 cores integrated AMD Radeon Graphics - 15.6″ FHD windows 11 home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the battery life is not quite long enough to last a full day of work or classes. 1080p display has a cool tint, and it’s heavy at 3.8 pounds.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has above-average build quality and, reliable fingerprint reader on its trackpad. Its backlit keyboard was quiet and satisfying to type on, and its trackpad worked well.\n\nI don't know if this changes anything, but I'm based in Latin America, so do with that information what you will. Thank you in advance!",

I spoke to ASUS support and they said it was normal and to monitor it for a few days but it honestly didn’t feel normal. A bit more info, once I took it off charge, the heat started to cooldown and after 15 mins it’s okay and I haven’t plugged it back in. Also, I checked the task manager and it said everything was okay (was using ChatGPT to check cuz I don’t know much about computers), also temp said was only 46degrees Celsius. Anyway my question is, does anyone happen to know what’s going on, if it’s normal or there’s a problem with the charger or advice on what to do. Would be much appreciated thank you,",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm deep in analysis paralysis and could really use some outside perspective. I'm about to buy a laptop that needs to be my main workhorse for the next few years, and I'm torn between two very tempting, but very different, HP options.  \n**My Situation:**\n\n* **Student:** I'm in my final year studying Nutrition in Argentina. My current old laptop is painfully slow and killing my motivation to study. Need something reliable and fast for research (tons of tabs!), writing, etc.\n* **Aspiring Content Creator:** Starting an Instagram project focused on nutrition and fitness videos (think short reels/stories, editing footage from my phone). Need a machine that can handle video editing smoothly (using DaVinci Resolve/Premiere Pro level software).\n* **Budget & Risk:** My total budget is tight (around $1500 USD equivalent *total* for everything, PC related). These laptops eat a significant chunk. I recently cancelled a PC build due to indecision and rising costs, so I'm really anxious about making the *right*, *safe* choice this time. Risk of hardware failure *really* worries me. I also want to buy a cell phone since mine broke. But I don't want to be left with nothing in my pocket either.\n* **Priorities:** Need something **modern** with a **great screen** for visual work. Performance for editing is key. Portability isn't the *top* priority anymore, but decent battery is good.\n\n**The Contenders:**\n\n**Option 1: HP EliteBook 840 G11 (Used - \"Like New\")**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$400 USD (Argentine Pesos equivalent: \\~$750k ARS)\n* **CPU:** Intel Core **Ultra 7 165U** (12c/14h) - Latest gen, efficient but powerful.\n* **RAM:** **32 GB DDR5** (Awesome for multitasking!)\n* **SSD:** 512 GB NVMe\n* **GPU:** Intel Arc Graphics\n* **Screen:** 14\" WUXGA (1920x1200) IPS (Confirmed NOT the dreaded HD!)\n* **Condition:** Used (looks pristine in pics), claims excellent battery life (5-6+ hrs).\n* **PROS:** **Amazing RAM amount & speed**, latest Ultra 7 CPU, premium EliteBook build, great price for the specs.\n* **CONS (The HUGE one):** **ZERO WARRANTY.** If it breaks, I lose \\~$400 USD and my main tool. Seller is straightforward about this. High risk.\n\n**Option 2: HP Pavilion Plus 14 (ew1000la - BRAND NEW)**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$650 USD (Argentine Pesos equivalent: \\~$1.2M ARS)\n* **CPU:** Intel Core **Ultra 5 125H** (14c/18h - \"H\" series, better for sustained performance like rendering!)\n* **RAM:** 16 GB LPDDR5X (Soldered, very fast but **only 16GB**)\n* **SSD:** 512 GB NVMe\n* **GPU:** Intel Arc Graphics (likely slightly better version due to \"H\" CPU)\n* **Screen:** **14\" 2.8K (2880x1800) OLED, 120Hz VRR** (Absolutely gorgeous, perfect for visual work!)\n* **Condition:** **BRAND NEW.**\n* **PROS:** **NEW with 1-Year HP Warranty** (Huge peace of mind!), **stunning OLED screen**, more powerful CPU for rendering, zero risk initially.\n* **CONS:** **Only 16GB RAM** (will I regret this for heavy editing/multitasking?), **significantly more expensive** (\\~$250 USD difference is huge for me), eats much more of my safety net budget.\n\n**My Dilemma:**\n\nThe EliteBook G11 feels like incredible value spec-wise, especially that 32GB DDR5 RAM for juggling studies and editing. But the **lack of warranty terrifies me.** Given my budget constraints and past indecision, a hardware failure would be devastating.\n\nThe Pavilion Plus 14 is **safe, has that dream OLED screen**, and arguably a better CPU for my main creative task (rendering). But is 16GB of (fast) RAM *really* enough for smooth 4K phone footage editing + having browser tabs/study materials open? And is that safety + screen worth the extra \\~$250 USD and halving my RAM?\n\nWhich path is smarter for someone in my shoes? Do I gamble on the used powerhouse, or invest more in the safer, visually stunning (but potentially RAM-limited) new machine?\n\nThanks so much for any advice!",

Everything I have for taking notes (Notion, Obsidian), coding (VS Code, entire JetBrains library) and even Blender works natively.\nI'm not shilling Lenovo specifically, just want to say that you don't have to be afraid of Windows on ARM anymore, I've seen Acer laptops for around the same price. The model I have comes with a Snapdragon X Plus CPU, not even X Elite, and everything is still snappy, responsive and fast. When compared to my friend's MacBook Air M3, I have more ports, even an sd card reader, and an OLED display for about the same price (I don't have Thunderbolt though, but that's not a big deal).

Also, how even a simple matrix of buttons can interfere with laptop startup? \n\nI would be very thankful if you guys could come up with some ideas what to do next. I'm worried that it can be something with the motherboard itself.\n\nSorry for my bad english and thank you for your advice:)\n\nWhat I tried to do \n- Reconnecting EVERY flex and connector\n- Reseating RAM\n- Running it without battery/AC adapter\n- Holding power button with everything disconnected",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently undecided between two laptops and could use some advice. I don’t know much about the detailed specs of the laptops, and I won’t be using them purely for gaming — I also plan to use them for hobbies like music production and video creation. I also have sensitive eyes, so long screen sessions can be uncomfortable for me.\n\nOption 1: MONSTER TULPAR T6 V3.7.5 •\tIntel Core i9-13900HX •\t32GB RAM •\t1TB SSD •\tRTX 5070 Ti •\tQHD display\n\nOption 2: MSI VECTOR 16 HX AI A2XWHG-091XTR •\tIntel Core Ultra 7-155HX (assuming it’s 155HX, not 255HX?) •\t16GB DDR5 •\t1TB SSD •\tGeForce RTX 5070 Ti 12GB 140W •\t16” FHD+ 144Hz display •\tFreeDOS\n\nOne thing I noticed online is that the MSI tends to get quite loud on turbo fan mode. In my country, these two are currently the best options available in this price range. The Monster has a QHD screen, while the MSI has an FHD one. Other than that, there doesn’t seem to be a huge difference.\n\nThere’s about a $350 price difference, but it’s not a big deal for me. The Monster is slightly more expensive, but the prices are pretty close. Visually, the MSI has a more attractive design.\n\nAny thoughts on which one would be the better choice overall (build quality, thermals, display, long-term reliability, etc.)?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I have been using the same $50 laptop I bought used from my dad's job for maybe two years and It's served me well, but it very visibly and physically is giving up. She's nearly ten years old and a bit roughed up outside, she always has to be charged and runs out of battery fully charged in around an hour, even with the best battery setting and brightness down fully. The keyboard locks sometimes and you have to tap until it goes back into place. It's also extremely slow, so much that even good WIFI doesn't give it much of a boost. \n\n  \n(**Now for the real info!**)\n\nI'd like a laptop with good storage, decent RAM (*32 RAM is most preferred due to what I do)*, I do not care much about the touchpad size as long as it doesn't lock up cause I've had really annoying mishaps in the past of keyboard/touchpad jamming, I'd also like a laptop with a screen length of at least 14 inches (*I don't mind a bulky laptop if it runs well*), I don't care much either if it looks it bit non aesthetically pleasing cause I will get a carrying case and don't care how 'good' a laptop looks, a good quality graphics card (*I enjoy watching movies and playing videogames with good quality*), really reliable because I can't handle a crash. This will mainly be used for school (*uploading documents, watching course videos, working on projects, having several tabs open at once to multitask while still working well*) and playing videogames. (*Think Fallout, Slime Rancher, Resident Evil, Cyberpunk, etc*) \n\nThank you in advance!",

If I drained the battery completely I could then charge the laptop back to full as long as it wasn’t turned. \n\nTried everything I could find to fix it across the internet, but gave up after a few weeks and bought a new Lenovo Thinkbook. Was fine for a month or so but now the laptop won’t charge at all.\n\nNot looking for help per se, but just wanted to ask out of curiosity -\n\n*Question* ————————\n\nWhat generally causes laptop batteries to improperly interface with the rest of the machine? And why does it seem to randomly / suddenly occur?\n\nI.e are drivers faulty? Are there defects in the battery? Has the hardware been damaged in some way? Or a mix of all the above?\n\nHonestly just curious, no pressure for anyone to answer and no worries if no one really knows.\n\n",

I use the laptop for a month and a half taking care of it and being very careful with it during a presentation I have at work the laptop screen goes off and the caps lock starts blinking 5 long, 3 short. I get frustrated especially since its brand new but im like okay shit happens whatever. My main issue is when I took the laptop to the repair they told me the motherboard is messed up and they couldn't find a single motherboard out of the 100s they have that fit into my laptop, and tell me that HP is making laptops that cant be fixed. Now im left with a brand new laptop thats for the bin and a huge amount of work piled up, with the cheapest good laptops being 600 to 700. What a waste man",

The model I have comes with a Snapdragon X Plus CPU, not even X Elite, and everything is still snappy, responsive and fast.

Then i fixed valorant everything was working but i turn it on the fans the LEDs all working but the monitor is black and monitor is on it shows monitor logo but never the motherboard (gygabites) like it usually does. I tried opening removing RAM and putting it back cuz alot of ppl on reddit swore on it fixing the issue but nothing and some said to reset CMOS which idk how other than removing the battery and putting it back the issue is that its under the GPU so its almost not possible to do it safely while idk my way around the inside of a pc so i didnt dare. What can i do…? Is the pc faulty should i contact the seller company or can i do it myself ?  \n\n(Ps : when its on i cant turn it off from the power button by long pressing , i have to switch it off by the back button everytime also with the mouse or keyboard plugged in they dont turn on when the pc turns on either)",

    "selftext": "Hello.\n\nI've been planning to upgrade from an i9 9900k to 9950x3D for a couple of months now, especially since I've been noticing my 9900k struggling (and overheating) after I started doing a lot of batch filtering and processing  code.\n\nI also believe it's limiting my RTX 4090 for gaming.\n\nMy question is, should I wait for the rumored 9950X3D2 to release, or just go for the 9950X3D now?   \nLike I mentioned above, I do use my rig for both productivity and gaming. Which is why I'm opting for the 9950 for the extra cores and cache. Would the 9950X3D2's uplift (if true) from the 9950X3D be worth the wait? I'm not really in a hurry, I have been saving up for this for a while, and I don't want to repeat history when I got my RTX 2070, the Super cards released right after, and with my 9900k, the 10 series CPUs also released right after lol. So I'm leaning more towards waiting, but I could be convinced to go for the 9950x3d now if the rumored differences aren't that substantial. ",

    "selftext": "Hey so I finally got myself money for everything but the gpu. I figured getting a temporary one and using it for a bit should work. I am from Bosnia so prices here are so inflated I only really found 2 deals worth mentioning and debating. I know these are both old but please don’t recommend any other gpu’s the only option within this price range here are RX 580’s or some old nvidia ones.\n\n1070ti 8gb MSI Gaming Edition (85€)or Vega 56 Asus Strix (70€) Now before you jump to the 1070ti hear me out.\n\nThe seller of the 1070ti basically said “I am switching to a new gpu so i’m selling my old one. Didn’t mine as far as I know. I used it for 3 years.”\n\nWhereas the Vega one said he KNOWS it didn’t mine and even if it did he changed the thermal paste recently and as proof thers no thermal throttle and it works good for a Vega gpu he tested it in FurMark for 30 minutes and the delta difference between the gpu temperature and the hospot temperature was only 15c. So yeah he tweaked it a bit. Which one should I take the chance on? I hear currently the 10 series nvidia drivers are way worse than the Vega ones because the Vega ones are still used in laptops or something?\n\n\nAnother factor is that the 1070ti glows read and looks sick with 2 fans but the Vega has 3 fans and in my current pc case it would fit perfectly in. (I got some cheap rgb case with shiny lights.)\n\n\nThis is all paired up with an I5-10400f (But I will soon switch to a Ryzen 5 3600/5600 if it changes anything)",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I’m looking for advice on the next big upgrade for my PC.\n\nCurrent build (2021):\n- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X\n- GPU: RTX 3060 12GB\n- RAM: 16GB DDR4 3000 MHz (2×8GB)\n- Motherboard: Gigabyte X570 Gaming X\n- PSU: Corsair TXm 750W Gold\n- Storage: 1TB SATA SSD + 1TB WD Black SN850X NVMe Gen4\n- Case: PCS P209 ARGB Mid-Tower\n- Cooling: Basic air cooler (FrostFlow 100 V3)\n- Monitor: 1440p / 144Hz\n\nWhat I play / want:\nMainly games like Battlefield 6, Monster Hunter Wilds want to be ready for GTA 6 — aiming for high settings 1440p and solid FPS (100+ if possible). Want a build that will last a few years.\n\n⸻\n\nUpgrade path I’m considering:\n\nI’ve already ordered  a ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super 16 GB OC (used via eBay) for ~£600, warranty verified until 2027 but I found a Asus GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Prime OC 16GB GDDR7 PCI-Express Graphics Card deal for ~£740. \nWondering if it’s worth switching to that instead.\n\nThings I’m also looking at upgrading:\n\n • Upgrade RAM → 32GB (2×16GB) DDR4 3600MHz or better.\n • Possibly move to a 240/360mm AIO cooler for the 5800X.\n • Maybe a newer case with better airflow as I upgrade components.\n\n⸻\n\nMy main questions for you:\n\n\t1. With my build and goals, should I stick with the 4070 Ti Super, or switch to the 5070 Ti for “more future-proofing”?\n\n\t2. Is the RAM upgrade to 32GB DDR4 3600 MHz high priority now?\n\n\t3. Do I really need a better CPU cooler (and if so, what size AIO)?\n\n\t4. What case would you recommend for good airflow and future GPU length?\n\n\t5. If I go for the 5070 Ti — is the performance gain worth the extra cost (vs what I’ve ordered)?\n\nWould love your wise advice — trying to invest well, not just upgrade quick.\nThanks in advance!",

    "title": "Build Advice Needed: High-End Productivity/Gaming PC (7950X + RTX 5080?) + Quiet",
    "selftext": "I've been planning my first PC build and would really appreciate your feedback on the component choices, few more specific questions below.\n\nIntended Use:\n• Primary: 3D work (Blender - modeling & rendering), Game Development (Unreal Engine/Unity - coding, level design, lighting), Video Editing (Premiere Pro, After Effects).\n• Secondary: Gaming (Minecraft w/ RTX, Sims, AAA titles like Assassin's Creed).\n\nPriorities:\n1. Performance: Need fast rendering/compiling times and smooth viewport/editor performance.\n2. Quiet Operation: Aiming for a system that's near-silent during idle/light work and not overly loud under load.\n3. Aesthetics are important for me\n\nProposed Build (£3000-£3500 Budget): \n• CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X\n• Motherboard: ASUS TUF GAMING X670E-PLUS WIFI\n• RAM: G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 64GB (2x32GB) DDR5 6000MHz CL30 (EXPO)\n• GPU: Currently considering an RTX 5080 (e.g., ASUS TUF / Gigabyte Gaming OC) - See concerns below\n• SSD: Samsung 990 Pro w/Heatsink 2TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe\n• Case: Lian Li O11 Vision ATX Mid Tower Chrome\n• PSU: be quiet! Straight Power 12 1000W Platinum ATX 3.0 (Chose 1000W Platinum for efficiency/quiet headroom)\n• AIO Cooler: NZXT Kraken Elite 360 RGB (Side mount as intake) - probably not the best but I really like the LCD screen \n• Fans:\n• Bottom Intake: 3x Lian Li UNI FAN SL-Infinity 140mm (Reverse Blade)\n• Rear Exhaust: 2x Lian Li UNI FAN SL-Infinity 120mm (Normal Blade)\n\nRationale for Specific Choices:\n• Case: I really love the look of the O11 Vision Chrome, even though I know its airflow isn't top-tier due to the glass top. My plan is to compensate with strong intake from the 3x140mm fans on the bottom directed straight at the GPU, and the 3x120mm AIO intake on the side for the CPU.\n• Quietness: Chose the premium PSU ( is it overkill ?), a good AIO, and specific quiet-rated fans (planning to run them at low RPM via custom curves) to keep noise down.\n\nMain Concern - The GPU (RTX 5080 Value for money):\nThe ASUS ROG Strix 5080 is around £1400 currently, and even the TUF/Gaming OC models are looking like £1200-£1300+. While the performance seems great, I keep reading concerns that 16GB of VRAM might not be enough for futureproofing at this high price point, especially for 4K gaming and potentially for my creative work (handling large textures/scenes in Blender/UE).\nIs the RTX 5080 worth the premium over alternatives like the RTX 4080 Super (~£1000) or even the RTX 5070 Ti (~£850-£950), considering the 16GB VRAM limitation? How much real-world performance am I leaving on the table in Blender/Premiere Pro/AE by stepping down? Although I can afford the 5080 price, I just want to be a bit smart about this choice. Thanks ! \n\nQuestions:\n1. Does the overall build look compatible and well-balanced?\n2. Is my airflow strategy for the O11 Vision reasonable and will the build be somewhat quiet ? I have read so much that glass case are inefficient in terms of airflow that I am getting paranoid about the noise of that build. \n3. Most importantly: What are your thoughts on the RTX 5080's value vs. VRAM concern for my usage? Should I stick with it, or would a 4080 Super / 5070 Ti be a smarter buy right now?\nThanks in advance for your help and insights!",

I have tried updating my drivers, windows, i've installed kaspersky, and another antivirus, cleaners like ccleaner and malwarebytes but the problem got worse due to the sheer amount antivirus software use up all my cpu and ram.\n\n  \nI have not found a single thing to fix my issue, i feel like my pc is dying on my even though it's barely 3 years old and to be honest, I don't have the money to replace a part if one is broken.\n\n  \nIf some of you know what could be my problem, please tell me. the next thing i'll try is to reinstall windows but to be completely honest I don't have the means to make a full backup of my pc and I don't actually know if I can reinstall windows and keep certain files (like games, photos and work stuff mostly).\n\n  \nAppreciate any help, thank you very much in advance.",

My main issue at the moment is I don't really know what cpu I should pair with my parts.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm working with a strict budget but a 7800x3D is out of the question lol. I mainly play games so I don't need anything super crazy. I've heard the ryzen 5 7600 is a good cpu for the price. I'm a little clueless as to what is actually good compared to what I've just heard on the internet. \n\nI don't even know if the parts I've already bought are even that good. I just got what I liked the look of and what I thought was reasonable. (I went overboard on my mobo but I went for the look more than anything. Same with my 3080 vision oc). \n\nHow much does ram matter? I will buy something ddr5 but what's even good? Should I splurge out on some corsair kit or could I save some and go for a crucial kit? How much does branding matter for ram and what's the difference between CL30, CL36 etc.?\n\nAny help at all would be greatly appreciated as I'm quite new to this. All my knowledge so far as been done through my own research so I'm not sure how good it is. \n\nThanks!",

The CPU cooler lights up when powered on and I have what I believe are the DRAM and CPU red lights on the motherboard lit up, but nothing else powers up.

    "title": "£6000 Custom-Built High-End PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) Underperforming — Seeking Advice",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice or insight into ongoing performance issues with my custom-built PC. I had it built by a reputable company in **March 2024**, and although I have a decent general understanding of computers, I’m not confident when it comes to deeper technical stuff like tweaking voltages, overclocking, or manually adjusting CPU cores.\n\nI invested around **£6000** into this system with the goal of having a rig that could handle **any modern game at ultra/max settings** and high frame rates — ideally also being **future-proof for 4K gaming** down the line. I had a company build this for me and optimise the system in the hopes that I could just plug it in and play games at ultra settings without issue, but that hasn't been the case. \n\nCurrently, I’m running:\n\n* 3 monitors total (2x 1080p 60Hz + 1x 1440p 144Hz main monitor)\n* Main monitor via DisplayPort, other two via HDMI (one uses a HDMI → DP adapter)\n\n\n\n# Full Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D (Zen 4)\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA ROG STRIX RTX 4090 24GB\n* **RAM:** 4x Kingston FURY DDR5 32GB 5600MHz (currently running 2 sticks at 5200MHz for testing)\n* **Cooler:** Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix XT (360mm AIO)\n* **Case:** HYTE Y60 (Black)\n* **PSU:** Corsair HX1500i (1500W Platinum Modular)\n* **Storage:** WD Black SN850X 4TB NVMe SSD + WD Red Plus 14TB HDD\n* **OS:** Windows 11 Pro\n\n\n\n# Performance Issues:\n\nSince I got it, the system hasn’t been performing anywhere near what I’d expect for this hardware tier (unless I'm being naive). Even with background software and RGB programs closed, **most games struggle to maintain high or consistent FPS**.\n\nFor example, in **Battlefield 6**, with settings mostly on *High*, I get anywhere between **80–140 FPS**, constantly fluctuating with noticeable **frame spikes** and stutters. Although, this tends to be on the lower end, as do most other games. BF6 overlay show the **CPU frametimes spiking much more than GPU**, though GPU performance also seems underwhelming.\n\nOlder or less demanding games (e.g., Rocket League, League of Legends) run fine, but more modern or graphically demanding titles show big frame inconsistencies or low averages (I am getting 50–80 FPS on Ultra in GTA V, which feels way too low for this hardware). I have Rocket League settings all at the lowest for performance, but if I switch on all the settings at max, I still get frame spikes here as well. \n\n\n\n# RAM Notes:\n\nI’ve recently discovered that **running 4 sticks of RAM** can cause stability or performance issues compared to 2 sticks, but I'm not overly sure if this is correct.\n\n* With **4 sticks**, I can only reach **3600MHz stable**.\n* With **2 sticks**, I can run **5200MHz**, but anything higher fails to boot (black screen).\n\nPerformance *feels* slightly more consistent with 2 sticks installed, but FPS is lower. A friend mentioned my RAM might not be on the motherboard’s **QVL list** and that “compatible” RAM doesn’t always mean *optimal*.\n\nWould it be worth buying new RAM entirely, or is that unlikely to be the root cause here?\n\n\n\n# What I’ve Tried:\n\n* Updated **BIOS** and all **drivers** (GPU, chipset, Windows, etc.)\n* Tried both **High Performance** and **Balanced** Windows power plans (apparently 7950X3D prefers Balanced, so I tried changing to this yesterday, but everything still doesn't feel great)\n* Adjusted **NVIDIA Control Panel** and **Windows Graphics settings** to prioritize the 4090 and performance\n* Tested disabling unnecessary background software and lighting control programs, but issues occur despite this.\n* Checked performance on **UserBenchmark**, which consistently reports:\n   * CPU frequency *“very low”*\n   * RAM frequency below rated speeds\n   * System load higher than expected (even when idle)\n* Closed all overlays except **NVIDIA ShadowPlay**, which I’d ideally like to use for clips. However, I've tried turning this off in the past (although this was around a year ago), and I still had issues. I see other people using this all the time and they seem to be fine?\n\nDespite all this, I still see unstable FPS, frame drops, frame spiking and what looks like CPU underutilisation.\n\n\n\n# Questions / Advice Needed:\n\n* Am I **expecting too much** from this system, or should a 7950X3D + RTX 4090 genuinely be able to handle almost any game on ultra at high FPS (especially at 1440p)?\n* Could **RAM compatibility or configuration** be a major cause of these issues?\n* Is it worth learning about and adjusting **CCD/Core Parking or undervolting**, or could that make things worse without deep knowledge?\n* Any other ideas on how to **diagnose and fix** performance inconsistencies and CPU frame spikes?\n\nI just want to be able to play games on high settings with consistent performance and FPS, and I thought this sort of hardware should be able to do that. I've been on/off battling with this for 18 months I’m starting to feel a bit lost and disappointed given the investment, so any expert guidance would be hugely appreciated.\n\n\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* £6000 custom-built PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) underperforming since day one\n* Games fluctuate heavily in FPS, experiencing frame loss/spiking/stuttering, even at low/mid settings\n* CPU frametimes spike often; GPU also underperforms from what I can see\n* 4 sticks of DDR5 only stable at 3600MHz, 2 sticks at 5200MHz — unsure if RAM config or compatibility is hurting performance\n* Tried updating BIOS/drivers/power plans/Windows settings — no real improvement\n* Looking for help figuring out if this is **normal**, **RAM-related**, or a **hardware/software config issue**",

BUT a couple of years ago i came to the realisation i love 4X strategy games (and cant wait to try the likes of Balders Gate 3 with good graphics), the issue being - my poor laptop struggles to run things like Stellaris past the earlygame without having a heart attack, and can only just manage Civ games (lowest settings).\n\nAnyway, ive started putting together builds and the total comes to at least £900 for what i want/have been recommended.\n\nI am however, still on a bit of a budget - and if i can help spending nearly 1K i certainly will. I dont however have any experience of tracking PC part prices, and so have no idea if i should sit on my hands whilst ive got a week off work (next week) and wait for price drops in a month or so, or actually spend my time off building and enjoying.\n\nPlease any help would be so appreciated.\n\nHeres the parts: (ive no idea if the link works)\n\n[https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/vG8FRV](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/vG8FRV)",

    "selftext": "Due to often changing locations I've been using gaming laptops for the past decade, but I've recently settled and noticed that my good ol' TUF Gaming is just not cutting it. BF6 is borderline unplayable and I really wanted to play it.  \n  \nI've saved up some cash so I suppose it's time to finally build a proper PC. I'm probably going to pick Ryzen 7 9700X as advised by a friend, but I'm torn between the mentioned 9070 XT and 9060 XT 16GB. First one seems much more efficient, but the price difference is huge. I'm wondering if it's better to invest and future-proof or just pick the cheaper but still pretty good card.\n\nI'm not really playing that many modern games - BF6 and Helldivers 2 were the only recent titles that gave my laptop a hard time, so perhaps 9060 is more suited for me.\n\nI would be grateful for any advices or sharing your experiences with either of these cards. Thanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: My current monitor is 1080p and a new one isn't a part of my budget. Perhaps in a couple of months I'll upgrade it too, but 4K is not a necessity for me.",

This build was put together by someone else I no longer talk to, and I have no idea where to start to fix it. \n\nPart List:\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/JnGhKq\n\nI had been having sporadic issues with the computer shutting down at random, mostly when trying to run a second monitor at a different resolution or when playing poorly optimized alpha versions of indie games. I updated the graphics card & reseated the cables which temporarily helped. Today, I was opening Gmail when the computer again went black & now I cannot get it to boot. The CPU cooler lights up when powered on and I have what I believe are the DRAM and CPU red lights on the motherboard lit up, but nothing else powers up. I tried reseating the RAM again but the error did not clear. I looked up some old Reddit posts but I am going to be honest I need someone to ELI5 because those tutorials were all Greek to me.\n\nAlso open to suggestions of some reputable places to take the PC to get looked at if this feels like something I probably cannot figure out myself.",

Which is why I'm opting for the 9950 for the extra cores and cache. Would the 9950X3D2's uplift (if true) from the 9950X3D be worth the wait? I'm not really in a hurry, I have been saving up for this for a while, and I don't want to repeat history when I got my RTX 2070, the Super cards released right after, and with my 9900k, the 10 series CPUs also released right after lol. So I'm leaning more towards waiting, but I could be convinced to go for the 9950x3d now if the rumored differences aren't that substantial. ",

I am from Bosnia so prices here are so inflated I only really found 2 deals worth mentioning and debating. I know these are both old but please don’t recommend any other gpu’s the only option within this price range here are RX 580’s or some old nvidia ones.\n\n1070ti 8gb MSI Gaming Edition (85€)or Vega 56 Asus Strix (70€) Now before you jump to the 1070ti hear me out.\n\nThe seller of the 1070ti basically said “I am switching to a new gpu so i’m selling my old one. Didn’t mine as far as I know. I used it for 3 years.”\n\nWhereas the Vega one said he KNOWS it didn’t mine and even if it did he changed the thermal paste recently and as proof thers no thermal throttle and it works good for a Vega gpu he tested it in FurMark for 30 minutes and the delta difference between the gpu temperature and the hospot temperature was only 15c. So yeah he tweaked it a bit. Which one should I take the chance on? I hear currently the 10 series nvidia drivers are way worse than the Vega ones because the Vega ones are still used in laptops or something?\n\n\nAnother factor is that the 1070ti glows read and looks sick with 2 fans but the Vega has 3 fans and in my current pc case it would fit perfectly in. (I got some cheap rgb case with shiny lights.)\n\n\nThis is all paired up with an I5-10400f (But I will soon switch to a Ryzen 5 3600/5600 if it changes anything)",

I'm probably going to pick Ryzen 7 9700X as advised by a friend, but I'm torn between the mentioned 9070 XT and 9060 XT 16GB. First one seems much more efficient, but the price difference is huge. I'm wondering if it's better to invest and future-proof or just pick the cheaper but still pretty good card.\n\nI'm not really playing that many modern games - BF6 and Helldivers 2 were the only recent titles that gave my laptop a hard time, so perhaps 9060 is more suited for me.\n\nI would be grateful for any advices or sharing your experiences with either of these cards. Thanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: My current monitor is 1080p and a new one isn't a part of my budget. Perhaps in a couple of months I'll upgrade it too, but 4K is not a necessity for me.",

My friends say sometimes they hear what I watch, even when I roll down the volume to low. I checked, it picks up the talking parts, not music. On discord I turned off every AI and \"smart\" related stuff and fixed the activation volume to -50 dB.\n\nIs it possible to disable the system sound to the mic? The problem is that once when the mic was elevated (disabled), they could hear it.\n\nI know it's software related, bcuz one of my friend has the same headset without this problem.",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie’s Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

Environment is carefully hand-crafted with attention to detail, from the architecture of the buildings all the way down to the flushing sounds in the toilet.\n\nThe estimated length of the game is roughly 2 hours i would say. The length of the game depends on how fast you solve the puzzles. Some of them might be slightly on the more difficult side of the spectrum since they are a little bit unconventional.\n\n**Main features**\n\n* **Atmospheric first-person** mystery with light point-and-click style interactions.  \n* **Highly interactive environments** \\- almost everything reacts: drawers, switches, computers, instruments, sauna, etc.  \n* **Environmental storytelling**: newspapers, phones, and tiny props that hide clues.  \n* **Puzzles** that skew a bit **unconventional** \\- some are simple, a few are “huh… wait” moments by design.  \n\nBuilt to reward **curiosity** and **note-taking** rather than brute forcing.",

    "selftext": "To be more specific, Massive Entertainment put out a social media statement implying that they're encouraging staff to voluntarily leave the company/lay themselves off with benefits/company assistance:\n\n\"As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games. To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

    "selftext": "Okay, yes, I'm a fan of VTM: Bloodlines. The visuals, the music, the story with all the hidden stuff, the voice acting... Jeanette and Therese, the haunted house quest, damn it was good.\nThis feeling to be a monster, powerful, free, cover by vice decafance and sensuality..and humour. \n\nSo yeah, I knew VTM: Bloodlines 2 wouldn’t be great but a part of be wish they gat at least the atmosphere, the \" cool\" factor! ...well They dint and it turned out to be a disappointment. I was ready to play something less open-world, more action-driven, without the full open world and multi-gameplay style of the first.\n\nWhen I started the game, I had a little bit of hope... until they showed me the skill sheet and I realized how simple it was. I became... sad.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, it just doesn’t have a soul. It’s boring. The voice acting for every character, including the main one, is dull and lifeless, with no energy or personality. It lacks the sensuality, the vice, the dirtiness that made the first game unforgettable. The game feels too clean, like the studio didn’t want to take any risks. The female Nomad is boring as hell. Fabian the Malkavian is slightly less boring, but still not entertaining. And he’s a freaking Malkavian!\n\nThe controls are stiff, the combat is dull (I chose Tremere, maybe that was a mistake), and the game is full of bugs. The music... well, it’s somewhere? But when it plays, it completely lacks that epic gothic techno vibe from the first game.\n\nThat said, I do like the graphic style. It looks good. There’s something there, something that could make a great game if they knew what to do with it.\n\nI really hope this isn’t the last game of the series. I want a third one, something that lets them finally make a good game. I hope they listen to the community’s feedback and run with it.\n",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

In battle, you can deploy units alongside you (and give them orders via a tactical pause, if you want), and on a macro level you will seamlessly manage resources, supply lines, capture and defend locations, build structures, and more on a constantly evolving (in real time) strategic map. The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula.

It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics.

The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options.

Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do.

In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds.

The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original.

It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape.

Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie’s Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

Now my new table has a sort of satin top that isn't really sticky. My initial game plan was to get a large table topper type mouse pad, but now that I'm sitting at the desk I'm wondering why do I need one at all? Is it comfort thing? Am I just not noticing somehting now that will be obvious over time?   \nI'm more or less just looking on peoples general outlook on mousepads, what you use, why you use them that sort of thing.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone!\nI'm looking for advice on my next GPU upgrade. My main goal is to play on my 4K 160Hz monitor (ASUS XG32UQ).\nI currently have a 16GB 4070 Ti SUPER. It's a beast and I'm happy with it, but to be honest, to reach a stable 160 FPS in very demanding AAA titles at 4K Ultra, I often have to pull DLSS (sometimes in Performance mode) or lower settings.\nConsidering that the rest of my PC is quite spare (i7-14700K, 64GB DDR5, 1000W PSU), I'm in a dilemma:\n1. Do you think the jump to a (hypothetical) RTX 5080 Super (or whatever it ends up being called) will be big enough to justify the price and really \"tame\" 4K 160Hz?\n2. Or is it smarter to stick with the 4070 Ti SUPER (which is not bad graphics, far from it) and wait for a more massive generational leap with the RTX 6000 series?\nI am worried about buying the 5080 Super and that, although it is faster, it will still not be the \"definitive leap\" for 4K high refresh. What would you do in my place?\nMy current setup for context:\n• CPU: Intel Core i7-14700K (w/ Thermal Grizzly Contact Frame)\n• GPU: Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER GAMING OC 16GB\n• Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX Z790-E GAMING WIFI II\n• RAM: 64GB Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 6000MHz CL30 (2x32GB)\n• Cooling: Corsair iCUE LINK H170i LCD (420mm)\n• PSU: Corsair RM1000x 1000W 80 Plus Gold\n• Case: Corsair iCUE 7000X RGB\n• Ventilation: Mixed (QX140 and QX120) iCUE LINK\n• Storage: 2x WD Black SN850X 2TB M.2 + 1x Samsung 980 Pro\n• Main Monitor: ASUS ROG Strix XG32UQ (32\" 4K 160Hz)\n• Secondary Monitor: ASUS TUF VG27AQL3A (27\" QHD 180Hz)\n• Tertiary Monitor: XENEON EDGE 14.5\" Touch\nThanks in advance for the opinions!",

    "title": "Driver Timeouts, crashes, peripherals turning on and off on boot, what's happening?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I built my first PC in june this year and from the very start I faced one problem after the other and I'm pretty much at my wits end here, hoping you all can shed some light on what's going on.\nSorry for the wall of text, trying to give as much context as I can.\n\nSpecs:\n\nCase: be quiet! Shadow Base 800 FX white\nMainboard: Asrock B850M Pro RS\nGPU: Radeon RX 9070 XT\nRAM: Kingston Fury Beast ddr5 5600 16gb\nCPU: Ryzen 5 7500F\nCooler: be quiet! Pure Rock Slim 2\nPSU: Corsair RM850X\nMonitor: BenQ XL2720Z, HDMI\n\nWhen building the rig I resorted to leaving the mobo outside without a case, because inside my old case (Thermaltake Versa N27 Snow) it would turn on and everything but not get any display, just like it does now. \nIt was a very tight fit and I figured the mainboard or other components maybe touched places they shouldn't.\n\nOnce outside it's worked well enough but not perfect. Issues included: \n\nDoesn't recognize ethernet until 2 or 3 restarts. (Turning off fast boot, updating or restarting the ethernet driver didn't help)\n\nSome boot issues here and there bc my gpu is heavy and sags. (Also I broke off the lock on the gpu slot by accident) But reseating and/or restarting always fixed it eventually.\nNot the driver issues though. I got frequent driver timeouts several times a day, usually it's just the amd error message popping up and that's it.\n\nOver time, the timeouts caused my system to freeze and the screen goes black. Audio continues to play for about 30 sec to a minute before the PC restarts itself or just stays blacked out until I do a hard reset.\n\nI figured the poor seating of the gpu is the culprit, so I got a larger case (the be quiet!) and a gpu holder. Now it sits nice and snug. Didn't have any boot issues the first couple days, other than the mouse and keyboard briefly turning on and off during boot, typically right before the desktop loads. I didn't think much of it at the time.\n\nThe Driver timeouts continued to happen. So got into safe mode, uninstalled old gpu drivers with DDU and installed newer versions of gpu and chipset drivers. Both the previous and new gpu drivers were 2.5.9 versions, which a friend later told me are very unstable and to try 2.5.2 instead.\n\nSo I think okay, cool. Maybe that's the issue. Tried installing it the day before, since the ol' freeze and crash happened a whopping 4 times that day. Always when I have some program running like Chrome, Blender or even just something low performance intensive like a VN.\n\nExcept now my keyboard and mouse both lose power as soon as I get into the recovery window to enter safe mode. It still booted fine the regular way, though.\n\nSo, yesterday I turned pc on in the morning and it worked fine the 2 hours it was running. No issues, other than me being unable to enter safe mode due to the aforementioned symptoms.\nHad to get out of the house for couple hours so shut everything down.\n\nCame back later that day and suddenly I wouldn't get any display, just like the first time around. All I did was check the PSU ports beforehand, thinking maybe something's loose and causing these power issues from the day before. But it all sits nice and tight.\n\nSince then I tried checking for loose ports several times, reseating gpu + ports, reseating RAM, plugging in a second 6+2 pin pcie, instead of daisy-chaining with a single one. But nothing changes.\n\nI could take out all components again and test them outside. But if the case is the culprit, why did it work at first? Plus it's not like everything worked 100% smooth when outside either. It's just incredibly frustrating and I frankly don't know what to do anymore.\nIf I had to make an uneducated guess, my money would be on the mainboard being faulty?\n\nThanks for reading all the way down to here.",

Manage your dice rolls, upgrade or modify them, and choose the most suitable buildings for your strategy.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1of36xk/video/1il84a1yb3xf1/player\n\nEach round you choose a building from several offered to you, build/place it, assign dices to the buildings and collect the results.\n\n\n\nBuildings can interact with each other, be influenced by the environment, or change their function depending on whether they have a die assigned or not. Furthermore, depending on their functions, a high-roll die may not always be necessary or desirable.\n\n\n\nDices are divided from 4 to 8 sides and have different classes (farmer, merchant, soldier, etc.) that modify or improve their use in different buildings.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1of36xk/video/7yo64u42c3xf1/player\n\nAnd Thank you very much in advance guys <3",

    "selftext": "As someone who works in IT I am very stumped. About 2 weeks ago my pc started acting up and steam games were freezing/crashing. It started just with one or two but now every steam game I own crashes within 5-10 minutes of launching/playing. Now here’s the weird part, I have my games pass tied with my pc and Xbox and play black ops 6 on my pc and it runs just fine averages 60fps. I have a ryzen 5, rx 5600, and 16gb of ram. My first concern was ram so I launched task manager and even on black ops 6 which is my most demanding game my ram sits at about 85% usage which is high but still within the acceptable range. I have also deleted the download cache on steam, did a hard shut down, ran a full virus and malware scan which came back clear. And unplugged a 2tb external I have (thinking maybe it was corrupted) nothing has worked. The only thing I can think of now is BIOS. Just before this started happening I was trying to enable secure boot in bios which wasn’t letting me so I reset my bios back to default and that allowed me to enable it. But what still doesn’t make sense is why it’s only steam games? And it still functions as a computer. Any suggestions on what to troubleshoot next please!",

I tried once again just to make sure, and it happened again.\nShould I just return the PC and get a refund, or is there anything I should do that could potentially fix it?

    "title": "£6000 Custom-Built High-End PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) Underperforming — Seeking Advice",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice or insight into ongoing performance issues with my custom-built PC. I had it built by a reputable company in **March 2024**, and although I have a decent general understanding of computers, I’m not confident when it comes to deeper technical stuff like tweaking voltages, overclocking, or manually adjusting CPU cores.\n\nI invested around **£6000** into this system with the goal of having a rig that could handle **any modern game at ultra/max settings** and high frame rates — ideally also being **future-proof for 4K gaming** down the line. I had a company build this for me and optimise the system in the hopes that I could just plug it in and play games at ultra settings without issue, but that hasn't been the case.\n\nCurrently, I’m running:\n\n* 3 monitors total (2x 1080p 60Hz + 1x 1440p 144Hz main monitor)\n* Main monitor via DisplayPort, other two via HDMI (one uses a HDMI → DP adapter)\n\n# Full Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D (Zen 4)\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA ROG STRIX RTX 4090 24GB\n* **RAM:** 4x Kingston FURY DDR5 32GB 5600MHz (currently running 2 sticks at 5200MHz for testing)\n* **Cooler:** Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix XT (360mm AIO)\n* **Case:** HYTE Y60 (Black)\n* **PSU:** Corsair HX1500i (1500W Platinum Modular)\n* **Storage:** WD Black SN850X 4TB NVMe SSD + WD Red Plus 14TB HDD\n* **OS:** Windows 11 Pro\n\n# Performance Issues:\n\nSince I got it, the system hasn’t been performing anywhere near what I’d expect for this hardware tier (unless I'm being naive). Even with background software and RGB programs closed, **most games struggle to maintain high or consistent FPS**.\n\nFor example, in **Battlefield 6**, with settings mostly on *High*, I get anywhere between **80–140 FPS**, constantly fluctuating with noticeable **frame spikes** and stutters. Although, this tends to be on the lower end, as do most other games. BF6 overlay show the **CPU frametimes spiking much more than GPU**, though GPU performance also seems underwhelming.\n\nOlder or less demanding games (e.g., Rocket League, League of Legends) run fine, but more modern or graphically demanding titles show big frame inconsistencies or low averages (I am getting 50–80 FPS on Ultra in GTA V, which feels way too low for this hardware). I have Rocket League settings all at the lowest for performance, but if I switch on all the settings at max, I still get frame spikes here as well.\n\n# RAM Notes:\n\nI’ve recently discovered that **running 4 sticks of RAM** can cause stability or performance issues compared to 2 sticks, but I'm not overly sure if this is correct.\n\n* With **4 sticks**, I can only reach **3600MHz stable**.\n* With **2 sticks**, I can run **5200MHz**, but anything higher fails to boot (black screen).\n\nPerformance *feels* slightly more consistent with 2 sticks installed, but FPS is lower. A friend mentioned my RAM might not be on the motherboard’s **QVL list** and that “compatible” RAM doesn’t always mean *optimal*.\n\nWould it be worth buying new RAM entirely, or is that unlikely to be the root cause here?\n\n# What I’ve Tried:\n\n* Updated **BIOS** and all **drivers** (GPU, chipset, Windows, etc.)\n* Tried both **High Performance** and **Balanced** Windows power plans (apparently 7950X3D prefers Balanced, so I tried changing to this yesterday, but everything still doesn't feel great)\n* Adjusted **NVIDIA Control Panel** and **Windows Graphics settings** to prioritize the 4090 and performance\n* Tested disabling unnecessary background software and lighting control programs, but issues occur despite this.\n* Checked performance on **UserBenchmark**, which consistently reports:\n   * CPU frequency *“very low”*\n   * RAM frequency below rated speeds\n   * System load higher than expected (even when idle)\n* Closed all overlays except **NVIDIA ShadowPlay**, which I’d ideally like to use for clips. However, I've tried turning this off in the past (although this was around a year ago), and I still had issues. I see other people using this all the time and they seem to be fine?\n\nDespite all this, I still see unstable FPS, frame drops, frame spiking and what looks like CPU underutilisation.\n\n# Questions / Advice Needed:\n\n* Am I **expecting too much** from this system, or should a 7950X3D + RTX 4090 genuinely be able to handle almost any game on ultra at high FPS (especially at 1440p)?\n* Could **RAM compatibility or configuration** be a major cause of these issues?\n* Is it worth learning about and adjusting **CCD/Core Parking or undervolting**, or could that make things worse without deep knowledge?\n* Any other ideas on how to **diagnose and fix** performance inconsistencies and CPU frame spikes?\n\nI just want to be able to play games on high settings with consistent performance and FPS, and I thought this sort of hardware should be able to do that. I've been on/off battling with this for 18 months I’m starting to feel a bit lost and disappointed given the investment, so any expert guidance would be hugely appreciated.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* £6000 custom-built PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) underperforming since day one\n* Games fluctuate heavily in FPS, experiencing frame loss/spiking/stuttering, even at low/mid settings\n* CPU frametimes spike often; GPU also underperforms from what I can see\n* 4 sticks of DDR5 only stable at 3600MHz, 2 sticks at 5200MHz — unsure if RAM config or compatibility is hurting performance\n* Tried updating BIOS/drivers/power plans/Windows settings — no real improvement\n* Looking for help figuring out if this is **normal**, **RAM-related**, or a **hardware/software config issue**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dyg150a4p2xf1.jpg?width=1212&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de264762270719d2c4902452974c4af60507a8b4\n\n  \n",

Racing chairs were designed to LOOK cool, not to BE comfortable.\n\n**Monitors:**\n\n**DON'T buy:** \"Gaming monitor\" with 1ms response time claim but terrible colors\n\n**DO buy:** Good IPS panel with actual 144Hz+ refresh rate\n\nWhat actually matters:\n\n* Actual refresh rate (240Hz minimum for competitive gaming)\n* Response time (but measured honestly, not marketing BS)\n* Panel type (IPS for colors, TN for cheapest high refresh)\n* FreeSync/G-Sync compatibility\n\nLG, Samsung, Dell make great gaming monitors without the \"gamer\" aesthetic markup.\n\n**What IS worth the premium:**\n\n* **Mouse pads (extended):** $15-25 for a nice extended desk mat is worth it\n* **Monitor arms:** $30-50 for desk space and ergonomics\n* **Cable management:** $10 in velcro straps makes your setup look pro\n\n**The mindset shift:**\n\nAsk yourself: \"Does this feature improve my performance or comfort?\"\n\n* RGB lighting? No.\n* Angular aggressive design? No.\n* Actual mechanical switches? Yes.\n* Adjustable ergonomics? Yes.\n* High refresh rate? Yes.\n* \"Pro gamer endorsed\"? Absolutely not.\n\n**My current setup (total: \\~$400):**\n\n* Mouse: Logitech G305 - $40\n* Keyboard: Royal Kludge RK61 - $45\n* Headphones: Philips SHP9500 + BoomPro - $80\n* Mousepad: Large desk mat - $20\n* Chair: Used Steelcase Leap - $300 (Craigslist)\n\nThis beats my old $800 \"all gaming gear\" setup in every single way.\n\n**The exception:**\n\nIf you genuinely LOVE RGB and flashy designs, go for it. But don't convince yourself you're paying for \"performance.\" You're paying for aesthetics, and that's okay if you know what you're buying.\n\n**Bottom line:**\n\nThe gaming peripheral market preys on people who don't know what actually matters. Now you do.\n\nWhat \"gaming\" gear did you replace with better non-gaming alternatives? Share your wins.",

I tried comparing the area to the **AM5 socket pin map**, but it’s really hard to tell exactly where they’re located.\n\nNow I’m wondering — does anyone know what those pins might be for, and is there a chance the board could still work fine without them?",

    "selftext": "TL;DR - Replacing Gtx1080ti\nNeed: More than 30FPS on 32\" QHD monitor. Want: Longevity, Future-proofing\nHave: Recently Upgraded PC - MB, CPU, RAM. Budget: 650USD (flexible)\nQueries: AMD/Nvidia? 2nd-Hand/New/Brand New?\n\nLooking for some advice on upgrading my old and tired GTX 1080 Ti 11GB. I've had it for nearly 8 years and it's finally giving up the ghost (can only get 30FPS on Borderlands 4, unless I downscale). I'm aware that anything I buy will be a significant improvement over my 1080Ti potato.\n\nHere are my PC specs:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7600X\nMB: Gigabyte B650M PCIe 4.0 x16 Motherboard\nRAM: 32GB 5600MHz DDR5\nDISPLAY: 32\" 1440p (QHD) Curved Monitor\nPSU: Corsair 750W\nGPU: NVIDIA 1080TI 11GB \n\nThese seem to be my upgrade options:\n\n1) Buy a second-hand 3070 or 3080 (or Ti) - High risk, low cost - 5 years old already, no warranty, power hungry and warm, mining risk - I'm already asking around mates who have upgraded recently themselves.\n\n2) Buy a 5070 or 5070Ti - Price has decreased recently, has a warranty, mixed reviews online, cooler than 3080s (it gets hot in Australia) - some second hand options are available with a  warranty.\n\n3) Buy a brand new RTX 6000 series - concerned about power requirements and potential bottlenecks (PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0), high cost - seems overkill? \n\n4) Consider an AMD alternative - 9060 or 7800 XT? - Lower cost, has warranty, higher VRAM/longevity - I've been impressed with my AMD CPU after being a long time Intel fan boy, but not sure about their GPUs. I heard the loss of Raytracing and DLSS is a huge hit, despite the price difference.\n\nMy Priorities:\n\nLongevity - can I find a replacement that I can get away with another 5+ years? I've heard more VRAM is probably a better idea long term - trying to avoid the need for Mobo (PCIe 4) and PSU (700W) replacement.\n\nMid-range-ish - I'm not looking for amazing, top of the line, blow your face off, graphics. I don't mind running some games on medium, so long as I can play them on my QHD monitor  seamlessly, without obvious visual lag. \n\nGames - I mostly play Borderlands, Sea of Thieves and some Xbox Gamepass games. I don't really play any fast shooters, AAA or intensive games like GTA, BF6, COD or CS.\n\nBudget - I'd ideally like to spend less than $1000 AUD (650 USD), but if waiting a little longer and buying better is worthwhile then perfect, as I'm not in a huge rush - Black Friday Sales are coming up soon.\n\nThank you for reading, sorry for the wall of text. I look forward to any advice and recommendations you can give :D",

    "selftext": "I'm getting progressively more and more upset at companies like HP etc.  \n\nI am running into more and more issues trying to clone and upgrade people's older devices to newer models they buy. \n\nFor context, part of my job can be moving files / people's things from their old PC to the new one they buy.  You can only imagine how much an 80 year old would hate having to do anything more than the minimum when it comes to technology. \n\nWith software, I can migrate their data, like pictures, files, etc but it's not 100%- things like printers, programs, configurations, etc all don't move well even with decent software that's suppose to migrate you from one PC to another. \n\nI instead, will clone their old PC to a temp SSD, upgrade it to W11, update / install all those FUCKING vendor specific drivers and then attempt to boot into it. \n\nIt use to work flawlessly- but now we got these god forsaken new PC''s coming with drivers, bios versions, and hardware that only work properly on certain windows versions, and must all be configured perfectly with each other.  Change bios from RAID, because fuck intel rapid storage, or the vendor has some special controller drivers that don't work on W11 22h2 only 24h2, and the default windows drivers don't function.  I get errors, issues, and all sorts of headache now with modern machines. \n\nMany won't boot though NVME despite it all, and yet works just fine over a usb connection, so you might say \" oh, you just gotta make sure boot type is set right in bios and the right driver is in\" \n\nIT IS!!!!!!!!  I have not found out exactly what it is yet, and I just don't have the time at work to do it this way ( it's not how they want us to do it) but I want the customer to get the best result, but it's getting difficult to fix.. \n\nAny custom machine, and it would just work- the default windows NVME controller driver works just fine, but apparently things have to be extra special. \n\n\nIf you read this all, then thanks- maybe I'm just missing something, but I wanted to vent my frustration, no matter how dumb it may or may not be.\n\nEdit:  None of these issues ever appeared till companies started moving towards NVME / M.2 systems.  I never had any problem at all with SATA.",

    "selftext": "TL;DR - Replacing Gtx1080ti\nNeed: More than 30FPS on 32\" QHD monitor. Want: Longevity, Future-proofing\nHave: Recently Upgraded PC - MB, CPU, RAM. Budget: 650USD (flexible)\nQueries: AMD/Nvidia? 2nd-Hand/New/Brand New?\n\nLooking for some advice on upgrading my old and tired GTX 1080 Ti 11GB. I've had it for nearly 8 years and it's finally giving up the ghost (can only get 30FPS on Borderlands 4, unless I downscale). I'm aware that anything I buy will be a significant improvement over my 1080Ti potato.\n\nHere are my PC specs:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7600X\nMB: Gigabyte B650M PCIe 4.0 x16 Motherboard\nRAM: 32GB 5600MHz DDR5\nDISPLAY: 32\" 1440p (QHD) Curved Monitor\nPSU: Corsair 750W\nGPU: NVIDIA 1080TI 11GB \n\nThese seem to be my upgrade options:\n\n1) Buy a second-hand 3070 or 3080 (or Ti) - High risk, low cost - 5 years old already, no warranty, power hungry and warm, mining risk - I'm already asking around mates who have upgraded recently themselves.\n\n2) Buy a 5070 or 5070Ti - Price has decreased recently, has a warranty, mixed reviews online, cooler than 3080s (it gets hot in Australia) - some second hand options are available with a  warranty.\n\n3) Buy a brand new RTX 6000 series - concerned about power requirements and potential bottlenecks (PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0), high cost - seems overkill? \n\n4) Consider an AMD alternative - 9060 or 7800 XT? - Lower cost, has warranty, higher VRAM/longevity - I've been impressed with my AMD CPU after being a long time Intel fan boy, but not sure about their GPUs. I heard the loss of Raytracing and DLSS is a huge hit, despite the price difference.\n\nMy Priorities:\n\nLongevity - can I find a replacement that I can get away with another 5+ years? I've heard more VRAM is probably a better idea long term - trying to avoid the need for Mobo (PCIe 4) and PSU (700W) replacement.\n\nMid-range-ish - I'm not looking for amazing, top of the line, blow your face off, graphics. I don't mind running some games on medium, so long as I can play them on my QHD monitor  seamlessly, without obvious visual lag. \n\nGames - I mostly play Borderlands, Sea of Thieves and some Xbox Gamepass games. I don't really play any fast shooters, AAA or intensive games like GTA, BF6, COD or CS.\n\nBudget - I'd ideally like to spend less than $1000 AUD (650 USD), but if waiting a little longer and buying better is worthwhile then perfect, as I'm not in a huge rush - Black Friday Sales are coming up soon.\n\nThank you for reading, sorry for the wall of text. I look forward to any advice and recommendations you can give :D",

No overclocking, no upscaling... just heat in the form of wasted electrons. Three games, three resolutions, three rounds. Winner takes nothing.\n\nThe 5050 came out swinging in the first round at 1080p, winning two out of three games. Round 2 at 1440p saw the 4080 take some control back but ended in a draw. Round 3 at 4 K had the 6700K pinned at 90 percent usage but still managed to give the 4080 Super enough rope to completely KO the 5050 and send it crying back to its corner.\n\nNo, there was no point to this.\n\nYes, it was fun.\n\nThe video’s here if you want to see the stupidity unfold.

It hasn't reappeared on restart either. Should I be concerned about a potential virus or malware? I didn't run it and only used Notepad to see what was in it, but I'm not sure if there's something malicious I should be looking out for on my system that could have created this.

    "selftext": "As someone who works in IT I am very stumped. About 2 weeks ago my pc started acting up and steam games were freezing/crashing. It started just with one or two but now every steam game I own crashes within 5-10 minutes of launching/playing. Now here’s the weird part, I have my games pass tied with my pc and Xbox and play black ops 6 on my pc and it runs just fine averages 60fps. I have a ryzen 5, rx 5600, and 16gb of ram. My first concern was ram so I launched task manager and even on black ops 6 which is my most demanding game my ram sits at about 85% usage which is high but still within the acceptable range. I have also deleted the download cache on steam, did a hard shut down, ran a full virus and malware scan which came back clear. And unplugged a 2tb external I have (thinking maybe it was corrupted) nothing has worked. The only thing I can think of now is BIOS. Just before this started happening I was trying to enable secure boot in bios which wasn’t letting me so I reset my bios back to default and that allowed me to enable it. But what still doesn’t make sense is why it’s only steam games? And it still functions as a computer. Any suggestions on what to troubleshoot next please!",

    "title": "GTX 1080 Ti Upgrade Recommendations",
    "selftext": "TL;DR - Replacing Gtx1080ti\nNeed: More than 30FPS on 32\" QHD monitor. Want: Longevity, Future-proofing\nHave: Recently Upgraded PC - MB, CPU, RAM. Budget: 650USD (flexible)\nQueries: AMD/Nvidia? 2nd-Hand/New/Brand New?\n\nLooking for some advice on upgrading my old and tired GTX 1080 Ti 11GB. I've had it for nearly 8 years and it's finally giving up the ghost (can only get 30FPS on Borderlands 4, unless I downscale). I'm aware that anything I buy will be a significant improvement over my 1080Ti potato.\n\nHere are my PC specs:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7600X\nMB: Gigabyte B650M PCIe 4.0 x16 Motherboard\nRAM: 32GB 5600MHz DDR5\nDISPLAY: 32\" 1440p (QHD) Curved Monitor\nPSU: Corsair 750W\nGPU: NVIDIA 1080TI 11GB \n\nThese seem to be my upgrade options:\n\n1) Buy a second-hand 3070 or 3080 (or Ti) - High risk, low cost - 5 years old already, no warranty, power hungry and warm, mining risk - I'm already asking around mates who have upgraded recently themselves.\n\n2) Buy a 5070 or 5070Ti - Price has decreased recently, has a warranty, mixed reviews online, cooler than 3080s (it gets hot in Australia) - some second hand options are available with a  warranty.\n\n3) Buy a brand new RTX 6000 series - concerned about power requirements and potential bottlenecks (PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0), high cost - seems overkill? \n\n4) Consider an AMD alternative - 9060 or 7800 XT? - Lower cost, has warranty, higher VRAM/longevity - I've been impressed with my AMD CPU after being a long time Intel fan boy, but not sure about their GPUs. I heard the loss of Raytracing and DLSS is a huge hit, despite the price difference.\n\nMy Priorities:\n\nLongevity - can I find a replacement that I can get away with another 5+ years? I've heard more VRAM is probably a better idea long term - trying to avoid the need for Mobo (PCIe 4) and PSU (700W) replacement.\n\nMid-range-ish - I'm not looking for amazing, top of the line, blow your face off, graphics. I don't mind running some games on medium, so long as I can play them on my QHD monitor  seamlessly, without obvious visual lag. \n\nGames - I mostly play Borderlands, Sea of Thieves and some Xbox Gamepass games. I don't really play any fast shooters, AAA or intensive games like GTA, BF6, COD or CS.\n\nBudget - I'd ideally like to spend less than $1000 AUD (650 USD), but if waiting a little longer and buying better is worthwhile then perfect, as I'm not in a huge rush - Black Friday Sales are coming up soon.\n\nThank you for reading, sorry for the wall of text. I look forward to any advice and recommendations you can give :D",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

    "selftext": "About a year or two ago, I released the [ScottoFrog (Handwired Edition)](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/macropads/scottofrog-handwired-macropad) which is a completely free-to-build 3D printed macropad based on the [Frogpad](http://frogpad.com). It has the option to be either a single-handed keyboard or a normal macropad, I specifically use my copy of the board for gaming. It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB. That said, this is the [PCB Edition](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-pcb-kit) which is available on my shop if people are interested, in addition to the keycaps and 3D printed case. You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

All keys are working, only one caveat: the upper left LED is not blinking, but I am not a LED guy and its switched off any way (been using Das Keyboard Ultimate with unlabeled keys for years). Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

In the heart of this eerie silence, a strange house suddenly glows with warm orange light pouring from its windows, while the grinning pumpkin at the gate seems to whisper, beckoning lost souls to draw closer.\n\nThat’s Night of Howls Cherry Art’s special Halloween keycap, crafted to celebrate this year’s spooky season.\n\nEvery detail is meticulously recreated: the swirling purple sky, gnarled tree branches, the haunted house, and the glowing jack o' lantern all blending to create an atmosphere that’s both chilling and captivating.\n\n💡 Special Lighting Effects:\n\nUnder normal light, the keycap appears as a classic Halloween painting in mystical purple and orange tones dark, moody, and irresistibly alluring.\n\nUnder UV light, magic unfolds: the house blazes to life, windows ignite like flames burn within, and the pumpkin’s grin glows with ghostly delight as if the spirit of Halloween has just awakened from a long slumber.\n\nAfter UV light fades, the keycap returns to stillness: the haunted house sinks into deep shadow, yet the windows still burn bright, inviting you to step inside. The night sky stirs with faint, ethereal glows like restless souls rising to drift across the midnight heavens.\n\nThank you all so much for always supporting and standing by the team!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n● Link Raffle [https://zfrmz.com/tOT8niK8WuocbdyfXGhl](https://zfrmz.com/tOT8niK8WuocbdyfXGhl)\n\n● Link Image [https://photos.app.goo.gl/hhNATc2yNgq4yNMK7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/hhNATc2yNgq4yNMK7)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nArtisan Keycap Detail\n\n● Sculpt: Blank Art\n\n● Name: Night of Howls\n\n● Price for sale: $100/1 Keycap \n\n● Quantity: 5 Keycaps/ Colorway\n\n● Stem type: Cherry MX\n\n● All keycaps are cast multi layer colors resin 100%\n\n● The set includes: 1 box, 1 user manual, 1 ID card and 1 Night of Howls Keycap. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nRaffle info\n\n● Raffle will be opened within 12 hours and when Raffle closes, the winner will receive an invoice via mail within 1 hours and will have 24 hours to pay \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFollow Craftkey as:\n\nInstagram: [https://www.instagram.com/craftkey/](https://www.instagram.com/craftkey/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/Craftkeycap](https://www.facebook.com/Craftkeycap)\n\nWebsite: [https://www.craftkeyartisan.com/](https://www.craftkeyartisan.com/)\n\nDiscor: [https://discord.gg/k9B7eTV4HS](https://discord.gg/k9B7eTV4HS)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I am currently rearranging my desk and I wanted to share my three keyboards! All are connected to my PC at the same time (don’t ask) and I just grab one depending on what I’m doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn’t want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I’m done!! 😊\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

    "selftext": "\n\nA flat typing surface is not very comfortable. Most keyboards solve this problem by using profiled keycaps that form the general shape of a curve. However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws:  \n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

    "selftext": "My first mechanical keyboard was an aluminum NK65 into which I popped Zilents, but it soon became a closet board (and then I left it at my childhood home for when I visit the ‘rents and work from here). Since I’ve bought a couple ai03 boards, a Neo Ergo, a Rama U-80B, a couple Jacky Hippos, and the Classic TKL. The latter most really shocked me with how good it felt and sounded at the price point. I also stocked up on Gateron Oil Kings because of all the praise and was really shocked at how great they feel out of the box without added lube.\n\nAnyways, this week I’ve been back home and I’m miserable typing on the NK65. Everything feels and sounds bad. Maybe it’s because I’m a linear man now, and obviously I’m typing on better quality boards at home, but it’s also revelatory to me just how much progress has been made, on switch quality, on stabilizers, on affordable boards. I’m probably going to buy another Classic TKL to leave here and retire/ewaste my old NK alu boards (I have the 80% one also).\n\nCurious if others have found themselves having to type on their first boards from years back and what that experience was like. It has been very very hard for me to revert.",

I was hoping for the black edition but was out of stock so it's understandable.\n\nI been using 60% and 75% keyboards for 3 years now and overall this big keyboard felt a bit weird at first but then became second nature after 1 or 2 hours. Not to mention it feels smooth to type (using it to type this post RN lol) and it's not that loud, has that \"THOCK\" sound that some are never endlessly looking for.\n\nThe RGB feels okay, wish it was more \"shine through\" (this could be fixed with some shine through keycaps) and it feels okay, have not set it up that much but overall I like it, not intrusive like others.\n\nLooks and feel: 9.5/10\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn8a2p8vfowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c0d3fe5999a988e455883a0f382b130c05a124\n\n  \nThis keyboard has a TON of features, starting with the little screen \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wflohgblowf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4432d2d43d32bcbeff9208a1c4ca89358224d92d\n\nFully customizable and guess what? You don't need an additional driver/software on your PC for yet another keyboard, this one can be used via browser (I think only on Google Chrome) but that's a FANTASTIC advantage, you can use it on Linux and Mac without sacrificing the software or customization of the keys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yps8hhyklowf1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fbd0e74884beee989f1b7b101b883bf279171b9\n\nKudos to Chiikey for this, this is a fantastic feature and something to praise, also it was incredibly easy to just post a gif to the little screen instead of having to cut the gif into multiple images and upload them all like other keyboards\n\nSoftware/Drivers 11/10\n\nAs for the unboxing process it was pretty standard and actually a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nFor starters you do not get any fancy tools to remove the keycaps or the mechanical switches itself, still no clear indication if it's hot swappable 3 or 5 pins (still yet to tear it down, wanted to test it out of the box with no modifications or me removing parts of it) it IS hot swappable but there's no really a lot of transparency of how many pins or what switches are supported.\n\nYou don't get any additional switches unlike other keyboards (some only bring 3 but at least they bring them unlike this one) there's the tab for the compartment where you can store things and also you get some screws, some plastic... tabs? and a little black thing that I am yet to recognize at the time of writing.\n\nAnd of course, you get a USB cable to charge or connect your keyboard, type C so no worries there.\n\nThe USB dongle is inside the keyboard on the bottom part hidden in a tiny\n\nThe packaging was impeccable, very beautiful box and the keyboard was very well wrapped and protected, no dents or scratches and it wasn't all over the place, all neatly packaged in a big rectangular box.\n\nUnboxing and contents: 5/10 \n\nAs mentioned before the switches on this keyboard make a very satisfying \"THOCK\" \"THOCK\" sound, it's not clear if this is lubed but it really feels good, really really good, not that loud too just \"right\"\n\nIt doesn't strain my hands as far as I tested it (around 5 or 6 hours in total, more than enough for someone who works at an office and is constantly typing non stop, even now typing this review lol)\n\nMy only complaint is that no matter what I did, the knob click behaviour never changed when I changed it in the software, it always defaults to \"mute\" instead of \"pause\" or play.\n\nTyping experience 8.5/10\n\nTotal score: 10 + 9.5 + 11 + 5 + 8.5 / 5 = 8.8/10 \n\nPersonal score being honest would be more of a 9/10, it's a pretty darn good keyboard and worth every penny, my only grip is the lack of switches or tools to customize the keyboard to your heart's content and the color, really wish it could have been the dark colored version but that's something I will learn to live with.\n\nCheers!",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/osqvzf04zpwf1.jpg?width=1840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934d86fd6b2611ac9c1986eb8209ea86c09bf7b4\n\nA quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

    "title": "[RULES UPDATE] Media Only Post, Typing Apps, Games, and Extensions, Combatting Spam",
    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "selftext": "About a year or two ago, I released the [ScottoFrog (Handwired Edition)](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/macropads/scottofrog-handwired-macropad) which is a completely free-to-build 3D printed macropad based on the [Frogpad](http://frogpad.com). It has the option to be either a single-handed keyboard or a normal macropad, I specifically use my copy of the board for gaming. It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB. That said, this is the [PCB Edition](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-pcb-kit) which is available on my shop if people are interested, in addition to the keycaps and 3D printed case. You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

All are connected to my PC at the same time (don’t ask) and I just grab one depending on what I’m doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn’t want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I’m done!! 😊\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

    "selftext": "\n\nA flat typing surface is not very comfortable. Most keyboards solve this problem by using profiled keycaps that form the general shape of a curve. However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws:  \n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

It is now late October, and my order status is still \"Unfulfilled.\"\n\nTo follow up, I sent an email to their customer support on **October 15th** to cancel the order and request a full refund, but I have received no reply.\n\nI also sent them a message on Instagram on **October 19th**. The account has been \"online\" multiple times since I sent it, but they are deliberately ignoring my message.\n\nI recently sent an email to their customer support to cancel the order and request a full refund, but I have received no reply.\n\nAfter getting no response, I did a search and found this thread, which seems to confirm the worst: [Geistmaschine appears to be defunct/exit scamming](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1mq742g/geistmaschine_appears_to_be_defunctexit_scamming/)\n\nAt this point, I'm assuming the company is gone and has taken the money.

It has the option to be either a single-handed keyboard or a normal macropad, I specifically use my copy of the board for gaming. It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB. That said, this is the [PCB Edition](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-pcb-kit) which is available on my shop if people are interested, in addition to the keycaps and 3D printed case. You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need.

    "title": "Chilkey Slice68 HE Review",
    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

I know that this is on the low end of the HDR cert. but I’m wondering what my best approach is.\n\nI’ve already noticed that in SDR, colours look vivid and punchy, but the display itself isn’t very bright, whereas in HDR, the opposite is true. I’ve also noticed that the brighter the picture on screen, the dimmer the display gets, which slightly irks me, and I don’t want that to happen. I’ve tested SDR and HDR in Overwatch and Hogwarts: Legacy so far (those are the two games I’m playing at the moment), and OW looks really washed out in HDR, and not much brighter than SDR due to its bright nature.\n\nWhat’s my best approach in terms of HDR? Should I just leave it off and sacrifice brightness to get punchy colours, or should I enable it just to play darker games and/or when I watch HDR content? I have already calibrated it using the Windows tool. Many thanks!",

    "title": "ASUS ROG XG27AQDPG (500Hz 1440p QD-OLED) Written Review",
    "selftext": "ASUS ROG SWIFT XG27AQDPG REVIEW\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/JAbpUPTGknQ\n\nPS: I was sent this sample unit by ASUS ROG and have been testing it extensively for about two and half weeks.\n\nTL; DR: XG27AQDPG Review\n\nAesthetics: 8.5/10\n\nSemi-Glossy QD-OLED Panel: 9/10\n\nText Clarity: 8/10\n\nMotion Clarity: 10/10 (Best I’ve ever seen)\n\nMy PC Specs:\n\nGPU: ASUS ROG Astral GeForce RTX™ 5090 OC Edition\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor\n\nRAM: CORSAIR Dominator Titanium RGB DDR5 RAM 96GB\n\nSTORAGE: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280\n\nMy Background: I work in IT and I am also a content creator; I not only use my computer for work utilizing excel and Word among other IT related programs. But I also edit my own videos on my PC with Adobe Premiere as well. I play a large variety of games, everything from JRPGS, MOBAs, Third Person Shooters, Immersive Sims, FPS, Platformers and more! And one of my favorite games that I have been playing for the past 10 years is Overwatch which I have 2K+ hours and have peaked at high masters in competitive. The monitor feels like it is targeted toward competitive gamers that want a ridiculously high refresh rate display, excellent motion clarity and a gorgeous looking display.\n\nTested monitors -\n\n1440p QD-OLED: XG27AQDPG\n\n4K QD-OLED: PG32UCDM\n\nAesthetics & Stand: I really love the aesthetic of the ASUS ROG monitors. I know the hyper gamer look isn’t for everyone but I personally adore it. I love that this monitor once again has the flat stand instead of the “spider legs”. As an owner of a very large gaming mat and someone that moves his peripherals around all the time this monitor stand is perfect for my case usage. Just like always if you decide to use the backlight aura sync on the display, you will be presented with some excellent colors on the back of your display, really ideal if the back of your monitor is facing a wall.\n\n500Hz 1440p 27” QD-OLED Experience: So, first thing I would like to state is I haven’t been the owner of a 16:9 1440p monitor in almost 2 years. I did own the G9 Neo & G9 OLED at one point, but the last 1440p 16:9 I owned was the Asus PG27AQN, a 1440p 360Hz IPS display. At the time I loved it but as higher end 4K monitors started releasing I haven’t been interested in any 1440p displays again until now. I am definitely not saying a 1440p display is in anyway as sharp as a 32” or even 27” 4K display, but I think it’s sharp “enough” to say the least, especially with its specific case usage.\n\nNow to finally get to the point of why someone would get this monitor, which is the beautiful QD-OLED panel and downright ridiculous refresh rate of 500Hz. To say competitive games like Overwatch 2, Valorant, League of Legends, Rocket League and much more look absolutely ludicrous at 500Hz would be a huge understatement. The very high refresh rate, OLED motion clarity, QD-OLED vibrant color and accuracy, perfect black levels/infinite contrast, excellent picture quality all on a 1440p 27” display. In addition, with all the Asus ROG bells and whistles which consist of features like the proximity sensor, aspect control and so many other little things create in my opinion the most beautiful competitive gaming display you can experience today. Even as someone that glazes 4K 240Hz OLED monitors I highly prefer playing competitive games on XG27AQDPG over ANY OTHER DISPLAY I have ever used in my life. The level of fluidity and the crisp image is something you have to see in person to believe.\n\nText Clarity:\n\nI for sure missed the picture-perfect text clarity of a 4K display but with the PPI being 109. I had no problem reading text in games or even during regular desktop use, but just again be aware it will not be as sharp as a 4K monitor, even a 32” one which has a PPI of 138. Someone that is already used to a 27” probably won’t suffer from this issue but I did not like editing videos on a monitor this small. Regardless of resolution as someone that has been editing on 32” monitors and ultrawide displays I’m just not a fan of editing on a display so small. This isn’t the point of getting a monitor like this though and everything is still more then legible but I just wanted you’ll to be aware of my opinion on this.\n\nMotion clarity: Something as simple as reloading a gun in Overwatch 2 is overwhelming seeing in motion at 500Hz. The culmination of specs on this monitor is legitimately insane, so much so that playing competitive games on this monitor is somehow even more “beautiful” then when playing on 4K 240Hz. Which doesn’t really make sense since it’s a lower resolution but smoothness of the image almost makes the game feel more lifelike if that makes sense. I don’t feel like we will get to the point of displays being indistinguishable from real life until we hit that 700Hz+ point. But then again what truly makes this monitor so special is that in addition to having the very high refresh rate is it also looks freaking outstanding because it’s a QD-OLED display.\n\nTesting Of Competitive Games: So, I found that quite a few games were able to hit 500Hz even at max settings. But most were still able to hit it after tinkering with some settings even if it wasn’t able to consistently stay at above 500Hz (there were outliers though sadly). Now remember to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nCompetitive Games Experience\n\nOverwatch 2 Max Settings: 300-400 FPS\n\nOverwatch 2 Tinkered Settings 400-550 FPS\n\nRocket League: Max Settings 700+ FPS\n\nCSGO 2 Max & Tinkered Settings 300-400 FPS (Nothing I did got the fps close to 500 ☹)\n\nValorant: Max Settings 500-700 FPS\n\nLeague Of Legends Max or Tinkered Settings: 500+ FPS consistently\n\nMarvel Rivals Disclaimer Now this is a special case because this game is ridiculously CPU heavy with so many CPU calculations going one with things like Dr Strange portal. I was able to get like 300+ fps with only DLSS enabled raytracing off or on, and with frame gen like 350+. But playing with frame gen is kind of counterproductive to a competitive game so I recommend not using more than 2X MFG if anything.\n\nMarvel Rivals Max Settings DLSS With Ray Tracing: 250+\n\nMarvel Rivals: DLSS Without Ray Tracing 325+ FPS\n\nMarvel Rivals: Frame Gen Without/Without Ray Tracing 350+ FPS\n\nTesting of Non-Competitive Games\n\nSo, these next few games are games that I not only love playing but also showcasing on my channel when I am testing and doing showcases. But do take into account that to reach the 500fps threshold or even get close a mix of DLSS and Multi Frame Gen had to be used on some titles. But with none of these games being competitive, ridiculously low input lag isn’t necessarily needed (Arc Raiders & Big Maybe BF6 might be exceptions). And in my honest opinion what makes this monitor so darn special is you can dial up all the settings to max and get at least 150+ fps in like ever title. Or if the game is not demanding at all or with the help of DLSS and or Frame Gen, games that you wouldn’t even think would be able to even touch close to 500Hz had very surprising results. I tested more games but this gives you a gist of the performance you can get with different non-competitive titles. Remember again to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nNon-Competitive Games\n\nDoom Eternal: Max Settings with Ray Tracing 275-325 FPS\n\nDoom Eternal: Medium Settings & No Raytracing: 400-500 FPS\n\nHollow Knight: 800 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Max Settings, DLAA & Raytracing: 75-95 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Medium Settings DLSS Balanced with MFG 3X 250-300…4X: 330-375 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Low Settings DLSS Ultra Performance with MFG 4X 400-455 FPS\n\nReturnal: Max Settings No DLSS 150-212 FPS (Even with enabling just DLSS Quality-Ultra Performance there was no FPS increase)\n\nReturnal: Max Settings DLSS Quality & Frame Gen 325-375 FPS (Switching to other DLSS methods didn’t change framerate for me most likely because of the 5090 lol)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing No Frame Gen Enabled & Path Tracing 59-62 FPS (This might seem super low but being able to run this game natively at any resolution and get above 60 fps is really impressive. This is one of the most demanding games of all time!)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 90-100 FPS.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 100+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 150+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 190+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 200-350 FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 200+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 360+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 230+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 425+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Performance, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 450+ FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing, DLAA No Frame Gen: 140-150 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 2X: 240-270 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 3X: 325-340 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Medium Settings/Low Raytracing DLSS Ultra Performance Frame Gen 4X: 480-500 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & No Frame Gen 70-95 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 130-150 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 190-215 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4X 240-277 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 350-375 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 375-440 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4x 475-525 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA No Frame Gen 150-175 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 2X 250+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 3X 380+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 2X 344-380 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 3X 430-450 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 4X 500-540 FPS\n\nAsus Monitor Features: Firstly, the response time is 0.03ms if frame gen was not enabled every single movement of the mouse felt instantaneous unlike any other monitor I’ve used. In addition, you also have OLED Anti Flicker 2.0 which to my knowledge is an exclusive feature to ASUS monitors. In addition, the monitor comes equipped ELMB (BFI) which does a good job of removing motion blur on their displays I will be honest though you’re not really seeing much blur at 500Hz anyway. But when playing lower refresh rate titles, it is definitely an amazing feature. The Proximity Sensor is also amazing and is just one of the handful of tools that come in ASUS OLED CARE PRO. Which does a really job of slowing down the process of burn in on the display. The 3 Year warranty is great and ASUS DisplayWidget Center which also you to tinker with your monitor settings right on the desktop is Stellar. Lastly, I would like to state that with this monitor being HDR500 over HDR400 like found on previous OLED displays you can expect a overall brighter image and it is very pleasant.\n\nAspect Control Mode: Now this is probably one of the coolest features on ASUS monitors today but it works the best on here than I have ever seen on any display ever. To my knowledge this is the only 500Hz 1440p QD-OLED monitor that is capable of doing this with only tinkering in Nvidia Control Panel or the AMD equivalent and not using a thirds party program (which still doesn’t support the full 1440p resolution). But this monitor can do full 2560x1440 500Hz in its 24.5 inch mode and my goodness it is glorious. Being able to play at that resolution on a 500Hz 25” QD-OLED display is god-like. I definitely get the hoopla of playing competitive games at that size and being able to do it with the crazy specs of this display really makes for a fantastic experience.\n\nAt this moment in time this is easily the best looking competitive gaming monitor when it comes to fidelity, motion, refresh rate and colors. The Tandem variant is supposed to release later this year and if you prioritize oily black levels, a brighter image (540Hz on the higher tier model) and then also the 720p 720Hz dual mode that variant might be more ideal for you. But if you are fine with 500Hz (which is more then enough LOL) and a more vibrant monitor in color and realistic picture because of the QD-OLED Panel the XG27AQDPG might be the perfect monitor for you. I had ridiculously high expectations for this display and it still blew me away!\n\nOverall Score: 9.6/10",

    "selftext": "Firstly. WOW.\n\nI was honestly very skeptical about this monitor given that there are practically no reviews on it. But after using it and owning it I must say I am quite impressed and it sure exceeds my expectations.\n\nThe brightness 10/10. I flash banged myself on full screen white HDR video. (Would do it again). \n\nThe image quality 8.8/10. Yes it's not an OLED but this thing sure gives any matte OLED display a run for its money. I was actually going to buy the new Gigabyte MO27Q28G Tandem WOLED monitor however ultimately I was not prepared to buy disposable tech which burns in as I do a lot of productivity work. But compared to some matte OLED's I have seen this monitor is pretty damn close.\n\nLocal Dimming 8.5/10. Haloing is imperceptible to my eye. I can see some very minor blooming but to be totally honest I think most people are not gonna see it unless they look for it (Note I use this monitor with the Local Dimming set to Level 3). I don't mind loosing some details to get better blacks. \n\nGhosting would be a solid 9/10. There is some ghosting as per what I saw on the UFO test however to my eyes it's not a big deal and I don't notice it anyways and I would suspect that most people won't notice it anyways.\n\nThe panel is VERY responsive, I don't see slow reaction times. I run the display on the second fastest overdrive settings (out of box). \n\nI did notice something funny. HDR refused to work at 300Hz in Windows and the display wouldn't be detected as a HDR display unless I cracked it down to 240Hz. This is also on the latest FW update.\n\n\n\n",

    "subreddit": "Monitors",
    "title": "Resurrected dinosaur here with various questions about refresh rate options for matching media while on desktop on modern high refresh rate monitors plus VRR range",
    "selftext": "**Preface**\n\nThe last monitor I bought was in 2017 and was of a typical spec for the time 1080p 60 Hz IPS LCD. I have another one next to it I bought earlier in 2015. They're the ASUS MX279H and the VN247H. Presumably HDMI 1.4 and HDCP 1.4 compliant.\n\nI play some games, but I watch video media more. I'm quite sensitive to judder when the refresh rate does not match or is not a multiple of the framerate:\n\n* When watching 30p, 60i or 60p video I keep my monitor set to 60 Hz (good for North American and other formerly NTSC 60 Hz country's content, plus videos recorded on people's phones)\n* When watching 25p, 50i or 50p video I set my monitor to 50 Hz (typical as I live in Europe where everything is filmed and broadcasted for 50 Hz)\n* When watching 24p content I set my monitor to a custom 48 Hz and also experimented with a 72 Hz custom setting - lovely\n\nThe above settings make all video playback very enjoyable. I don't like looking at the judder of a 25p panning shot on a 60 Hz monitor and love having no judder when playing 24p at a refresh rate that is a multiple of 24.\n\n**Time to modernise**\n\nI have been upgrading my tech recently (no more Haswell-based system as I've build an AM5-based PC) and I am preparing to get into UHD gaming (likely with the help of FSR upscaling with the RX 9070 XT I have ordered). I have a few questions as I have never owned a high refresh monitor or one with a variable refresh rate (well, besides my new laptop with a range or 40 - 60 Hz VRR).\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. I'm looking at a 4K gaming monitor (LG 27GR93U) as the main monitor but I imagine these questions and answers apply to many models of monitors - it is a 144 Hz panel with VRR (48 - 144 Hz). I would like to default my Windows desktop to 120 Hz for ease of watching 24p, 30p and 60p content judder-free by default. Can I set the desktop resolution VRR range to be 48 - 120 Hz out of the box? \\*Judder-free video playback is more important to me than seeing more than 120 fps in video games. If this isn't commonly available, I might default to VRR off unless I'm gaming.\n2. When I want to watch 25p or 50p video content I'd like to manually set the screen to a 50 Hz (2\\*25, 1\\*50) or 100 Hz refresh rate (not 75 Hz as that's only good for 25p playback at 3\\*25, not 50p at 1.5\\*50). The manual to nearly every high refresh rate monitor I've looked at do not list 50 Hz and 100 Hz unless it is specifically a 100 Hz 1080p monitor. **May I kindly ask if some of you reading could check if your modern high refresh rate monitors have 50 Hz and 100 Hz options available within your Windows or GPU driver settings?** I would really appreciate it.\n3. I'm looking at getting a 1080p monitor as a second screen - one with HDCP 2.2 compliance like the LG 27GR93U has (looking at the Dell SE2425HG 1080p 200 Hz monitor). I have already seen that it supports 120 Hz so that is good for switching between 200 Hz when watching 25p (8\\*25) and 50p (4\\*50) content and 120 Hz for 24p (5\\*24), 30p (4\\*30) and 60p (2\\*60). **I've seen other 1080p monitors with weird refresh rates like 165 Hz** (bad for all video playback) **and 180 Hz** (only good for 30p and 60p playback). **If you have a monitor with these refresh rates, do you also have 120 Hz, 100 Hz and 50 Hz options? I'd love to know.**\n\n\\*Note: by judder-free I do not mean motion interpolation also known as TruMotion (LG), MotionFlow (Sony), Picture Clarity or Auto Motion Plus (Samsung) etc. I detest motion interpolation.\n\n**Final notes**\n\nI don't see too many people ask these questions online on other forums through Google searching and those who do rarely got good or knowledgeable answers. Many dismiss the OP's concerns, thinking that the higher the refresh rate, the better no matter what it is. Some have no idea about how mis-matching video content with framerate causes judder. 3:2 pulldown should be a term everyone knows but apparently not. If you have a look at your refresh rate options in your high refresh rate UHD monitor settings I'd be very grateful and more confident in what I buy. \n\nI encourage responses from as many people with as many different monitor models as available.\n\nWith Quick Media Switching limited to full screen video signals on UHD TVs (QMS), I hope that for PC monitors we'll see 2160p 600 Hz monitors one day (600 is the lowest common multiple for 24, 25, 30, 50 and 60). I don't care enough about 48p films to wish for a native 2160p 1200 Hz monitor.\n\nThank you.",

This will be my daily driver, but my main focus is gaming. I mostly play single-player games, though I do jump into multiplayer occasionally, but nothing competitive.\n\nI’m upgrading from a dual 27\" setup, so either choice would be a pretty noticeable change. My PC has a 4080 Super paired with a 7800X3D, so running 4K isn’t a problem. What I’m trying to figure out is whether I’d get more immersive experiences from the extra width of a 34\" ultrawide or the extra height of a 32\" 4K.\n\nIf anyone has experience with both or has a similar setup, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

    "selftext": "About a week ago, shortly after a Windows update, my computer monitors began to randomly turn black for about a second then return to normal. The computer remains running and all the monitors system lights remain lit. I have three monitors and a TV attached to my custom built PC. An AOC G2 CQ32G2S, an AOC 24B2W1 (List says AOC 24B2XH because I couldn't find the 24B2W1 on PCPartPicker), an ARZOPA 16.1'' 144Hz Portable Gaming Monitor, and a 42\" VIZIO TV. PCPartPicker list bellow.\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/P3gBkf](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/P3gBkf)\n\nI used this set up for about a week before the issue began. The AOC 24B2W1 is the newest addition to my set up and I added about two weeks ago. I can not find a pattern in when monitors turn black or in which ones turn black. Some times only one monitor will go black, some times two, some times all three. Which one is always different though it occurs more frequently with the two AOC monitors then the Arzopa. The TV has yet to have the issue. I also cannot find any pattern in the length of time between the issue occurring. Some times it occurs shortly after I turn my PC on then there isn't an issue for the rest of the day. Some times it occurs once after hours of use. Some times it occurs multiple times through out the day. \n\nAll the monitors are plugged into my uninterruptable power supply while the TV is plugged into a surge protector. The uninterruptable power supply and surge protector are plugged into different outlets. I have used all the cables before and have never had issues with any of them. \n\nThe issue occurs whether or not the TV is on. It has occurred while I was gaming, while I was watching YouTube, while I was drawing, and even when my PC was sitting ideal.\n\nI tried setting all my monitors and the TV to 1920 x 1080 at 60 Hz, but the issue continued.\n\nAlso occasionally the monitors will show static instead of black when the issue occurs.\n\nAny ideas on what could be causing this and how I can fix it?",

Connecting the KTC through either HDMI or DP-USB-c leads to the same effect.\n* It's not about the DP-USB-C cable on the ASUS. I've tested swapping the DP-USB-C cables and the result was the same.\n* It's not about the Dock. The effect is the same on the TB4 dock or using the computer's dedicated ports.\n* None of this is an issue on my other Macbook, an M1 Max (Ventura).\n\nMy current intuition is that somehow the KTC is \"faster\" at doing the handshake regardless of the protocol, and my M4 Pro somehow is shutting the recognition window for the slower monitor. And somehow this is an issue for Pro video cards and not for Max ones, regardless of age. Or maybe it's a Sequoia bug?\n\nIs there a way to fix this? Is the culprit the old ASUS monitor?\n\nChatGPT suggests I use an EDID emulator to delay the HPD of the KTC monitor. Does that make sense?",

Alienware’s 32\" 4K 240Hz QD-OLED also pops up in searches, but details on curvature are mixed. I need it mostly for Films, I might be willing to settle for a non curved if I cant find it but the black colour is also a big issue.\n\nHas anyone seen a *confirmed* curved black 4K OLED 240Hz model that’s actually released (not just announced)?  \nOr is it still something that’ll roll out next year?\n\nThanks in advance, I’d appreciate any real user experience or confirmed info!",

It never was. The thing that made it \"reflective\" was, in reality, the protective film.\n\nAh...

I am looking for a 27\" 1440p (144hz and up) screen that ideally is within £300 price range.\n\nAnything will probably be an upgrade at this point considering how outdated the current monitor I have is but there seems to be so many options.\n\nI don't really play competitive games that much anymore, but I do enjoy multiplayer FPS games like Battlefield 6 alongside singleplayer titles. I have looked into AOC Q27G3XMN but I've been reading some bad things about noticeable smearing and VRR flicker, also seen mixed opinions on Xiaomi G Pro 27i.\n\nSo here I am, asking for any advice, are there any hidden gems out there, monitors that are within that price range that are overlooked or ones you had good experiences with.\n\nEDIT: I use it for gaming but also for plenty of static content such as web browsing, youtube etc so any budget OLEDs if there even is any are probably a no no.",

    "selftext": "Hi /r/monitors 👋\n\nI'm replacing my wife's monitor, it's mostly for productivity but I'll occasionally use it for gaming. Mini LED feels like a great choice here, kind of a best of both worlds. I'd go for a great IPS panel, but given working needs, I'd rather not do an OLED. Targeting 27\" 4K, as 32\" feels a bit much.\n\nHowever, my wife insists that the new monitor be white. That really cuts down on the number of options -- even the monitors with a white backing plate, like BenQ EX321UX, tend to have a black bezel on the front.\n\nOne route would be to tape & cover the screen, then spraypaint, but that's risky. What I'd prefer is if the monitor can be disassembled enough to remove the bezel, then I go paint that separately. \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions on either:\n- Good monitors with a white bezel that satisfy my specs \n- Good monitors that hit my specs and can be safely disassembled enough to remove the bezel\n- Guides on how to most safely protect the screen in case of spray painting\n\nThank you!\n",

First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters. [P2712V Link](https://bit.ly/4gmDFse)\n\n**P275MV Plus (Mini-LED with DyDs)**\n\n* Same **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** dual mode\n* **Mini-LED FALD (1152 zones), HDR1000**\n* **What is DyDs**: the backlight is driven in sync with the panel update to keep motion clean **with local dimming on** and to improve visibility in dark scenes (less smearing/black crush than typical FALD IPS). [P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

    "selftext": "Firstly. WOW.\n\nI was honestly very skeptical about this monitor given that there are practically no reviews on it. But after using it and owning it I must say I am quite impressed and it sure exceeds my expectations.\n\nThe brightness 10/10. I flash banged myself on full screen white HDR video. (Would do it again). \n\nThe image quality 8.8/10. Yes it's not an OLED but this thing sure gives any matte OLED display a run for its money. I was actually going to buy the new Gigabyte MO27Q28G Tandem WOLED monitor however ultimately I was not prepared to buy disposable tech which burns in as I do a lot of productivity work. But compared to some matte OLED's I have seen this monitor is pretty damn close.\n\nLocal Dimming 8.5/10. Haloing is imperceptible to my eye. I can see some very minor blooming but to be totally honest I think most people are not gonna see it unless they look for it (Note I use this monitor with the Local Dimming set to Level 3). I don't mind loosing some details to get better blacks. \n\nGhosting would be a solid 9/10. There is some ghosting as per what I saw on the UFO test however to my eyes it's not a big deal and I don't notice it anyways and I would suspect that most people won't notice it anyways.\n\nThe panel is VERY responsive, I don't see slow reaction times. I run the display on the second fastest overdrive settings (out of box). \n\nI did notice something funny. HDR refused to work at 300Hz in Windows and the display wouldn't be detected as a HDR display unless I cracked it down to 240Hz. This is also on the latest FW update.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "ASUS ROG XG27AQDPG (500Hz 1440p QD-OLED) Written Review",
    "selftext": "ASUS ROG SWIFT XG27AQDPG REVIEW\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/JAbpUPTGknQ\n\nPS: I was sent this sample unit by ASUS ROG and have been testing it extensively for about two and half weeks.\n\nTL; DR: XG27AQDPG Review\n\nAesthetics: 8.5/10\n\nSemi-Glossy QD-OLED Panel: 9/10\n\nText Clarity: 8/10\n\nMotion Clarity: 10/10 (Best I’ve ever seen)\n\nMy PC Specs:\n\nGPU: ASUS ROG Astral GeForce RTX™ 5090 OC Edition\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor\n\nRAM: CORSAIR Dominator Titanium RGB DDR5 RAM 96GB\n\nSTORAGE: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280\n\nMy Background: I work in IT and I am also a content creator; I not only use my computer for work utilizing excel and Word among other IT related programs. But I also edit my own videos on my PC with Adobe Premiere as well. I play a large variety of games, everything from JRPGS, MOBAs, Third Person Shooters, Immersive Sims, FPS, Platformers and more! And one of my favorite games that I have been playing for the past 10 years is Overwatch which I have 2K+ hours and have peaked at high masters in competitive. The monitor feels like it is targeted toward competitive gamers that want a ridiculously high refresh rate display, excellent motion clarity and a gorgeous looking display.\n\nTested monitors -\n\n1440p QD-OLED: XG27AQDPG\n\n4K QD-OLED: PG32UCDM\n\nAesthetics & Stand: I really love the aesthetic of the ASUS ROG monitors. I know the hyper gamer look isn’t for everyone but I personally adore it. I love that this monitor once again has the flat stand instead of the “spider legs”. As an owner of a very large gaming mat and someone that moves his peripherals around all the time this monitor stand is perfect for my case usage. Just like always if you decide to use the backlight aura sync on the display, you will be presented with some excellent colors on the back of your display, really ideal if the back of your monitor is facing a wall.\n\n500Hz 1440p 27” QD-OLED Experience: So, first thing I would like to state is I haven’t been the owner of a 16:9 1440p monitor in almost 2 years. I did own the G9 Neo & G9 OLED at one point, but the last 1440p 16:9 I owned was the Asus PG27AQN, a 1440p 360Hz IPS display. At the time I loved it but as higher end 4K monitors started releasing I haven’t been interested in any 1440p displays again until now. I am definitely not saying a 1440p display is in anyway as sharp as a 32” or even 27” 4K display, but I think it’s sharp “enough” to say the least, especially with its specific case usage.\n\nNow to finally get to the point of why someone would get this monitor, which is the beautiful QD-OLED panel and downright ridiculous refresh rate of 500Hz. To say competitive games like Overwatch 2, Valorant, League of Legends, Rocket League and much more look absolutely ludicrous at 500Hz would be a huge understatement. The very high refresh rate, OLED motion clarity, QD-OLED vibrant color and accuracy, perfect black levels/infinite contrast, excellent picture quality all on a 1440p 27” display. In addition, with all the Asus ROG bells and whistles which consist of features like the proximity sensor, aspect control and so many other little things create in my opinion the most beautiful competitive gaming display you can experience today. Even as someone that glazes 4K 240Hz OLED monitors I highly prefer playing competitive games on XG27AQDPG over ANY OTHER DISPLAY I have ever used in my life. The level of fluidity and the crisp image is something you have to see in person to believe.\n\nText Clarity:\n\nI for sure missed the picture-perfect text clarity of a 4K display but with the PPI being 109. I had no problem reading text in games or even during regular desktop use, but just again be aware it will not be as sharp as a 4K monitor, even a 32” one which has a PPI of 138. Someone that is already used to a 27” probably won’t suffer from this issue but I did not like editing videos on a monitor this small. Regardless of resolution as someone that has been editing on 32” monitors and ultrawide displays I’m just not a fan of editing on a display so small. This isn’t the point of getting a monitor like this though and everything is still more then legible but I just wanted you’ll to be aware of my opinion on this.\n\nMotion clarity: Something as simple as reloading a gun in Overwatch 2 is overwhelming seeing in motion at 500Hz. The culmination of specs on this monitor is legitimately insane, so much so that playing competitive games on this monitor is somehow even more “beautiful” then when playing on 4K 240Hz. Which doesn’t really make sense since it’s a lower resolution but smoothness of the image almost makes the game feel more lifelike if that makes sense. I don’t feel like we will get to the point of displays being indistinguishable from real life until we hit that 700Hz+ point. But then again what truly makes this monitor so special is that in addition to having the very high refresh rate is it also looks freaking outstanding because it’s a QD-OLED display.\n\nTesting Of Competitive Games: So, I found that quite a few games were able to hit 500Hz even at max settings. But most were still able to hit it after tinkering with some settings even if it wasn’t able to consistently stay at above 500Hz (there were outliers though sadly). Now remember to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nCompetitive Games Experience\n\nOverwatch 2 Max Settings: 300-400 FPS\n\nOverwatch 2 Tinkered Settings 400-550 FPS\n\nRocket League: Max Settings 700+ FPS\n\nCSGO 2 Max & Tinkered Settings 300-400 FPS (Nothing I did got the fps close to 500 ☹)\n\nValorant: Max Settings 500-700 FPS\n\nLeague Of Legends Max or Tinkered Settings: 500+ FPS consistently\n\nMarvel Rivals Disclaimer Now this is a special case because this game is ridiculously CPU heavy with so many CPU calculations going one with things like Dr Strange portal. I was able to get like 300+ fps with only DLSS enabled raytracing off or on, and with frame gen like 350+. But playing with frame gen is kind of counterproductive to a competitive game so I recommend not using more than 2X MFG if anything.\n\nMarvel Rivals Max Settings DLSS With Ray Tracing: 250+\n\nMarvel Rivals: DLSS Without Ray Tracing 325+ FPS\n\nMarvel Rivals: Frame Gen Without/Without Ray Tracing 350+ FPS\n\nTesting of Non-Competitive Games\n\nSo, these next few games are games that I not only love playing but also showcasing on my channel when I am testing and doing showcases. But do take into account that to reach the 500fps threshold or even get close a mix of DLSS and Multi Frame Gen had to be used on some titles. But with none of these games being competitive, ridiculously low input lag isn’t necessarily needed (Arc Raiders & Big Maybe BF6 might be exceptions). And in my honest opinion what makes this monitor so darn special is you can dial up all the settings to max and get at least 150+ fps in like ever title. Or if the game is not demanding at all or with the help of DLSS and or Frame Gen, games that you wouldn’t even think would be able to even touch close to 500Hz had very surprising results. I tested more games but this gives you a gist of the performance you can get with different non-competitive titles. Remember again to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nNon-Competitive Games\n\nDoom Eternal: Max Settings with Ray Tracing 275-325 FPS\n\nDoom Eternal: Medium Settings & No Raytracing: 400-500 FPS\n\nHollow Knight: 800 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Max Settings, DLAA & Raytracing: 75-95 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Medium Settings DLSS Balanced with MFG 3X 250-300…4X: 330-375 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Low Settings DLSS Ultra Performance with MFG 4X 400-455 FPS\n\nReturnal: Max Settings No DLSS 150-212 FPS (Even with enabling just DLSS Quality-Ultra Performance there was no FPS increase)\n\nReturnal: Max Settings DLSS Quality & Frame Gen 325-375 FPS (Switching to other DLSS methods didn’t change framerate for me most likely because of the 5090 lol)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing No Frame Gen Enabled & Path Tracing 59-62 FPS (This might seem super low but being able to run this game natively at any resolution and get above 60 fps is really impressive. This is one of the most demanding games of all time!)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 90-100 FPS.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 100+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 150+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 190+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 200-350 FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 200+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 360+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 230+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 425+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Performance, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 450+ FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing, DLAA No Frame Gen: 140-150 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 2X: 240-270 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 3X: 325-340 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Medium Settings/Low Raytracing DLSS Ultra Performance Frame Gen 4X: 480-500 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & No Frame Gen 70-95 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 130-150 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 190-215 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4X 240-277 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 350-375 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 375-440 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4x 475-525 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA No Frame Gen 150-175 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 2X 250+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 3X 380+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 2X 344-380 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 3X 430-450 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 4X 500-540 FPS\n\nAsus Monitor Features: Firstly, the response time is 0.03ms if frame gen was not enabled every single movement of the mouse felt instantaneous unlike any other monitor I’ve used. In addition, you also have OLED Anti Flicker 2.0 which to my knowledge is an exclusive feature to ASUS monitors. In addition, the monitor comes equipped ELMB (BFI) which does a good job of removing motion blur on their displays I will be honest though you’re not really seeing much blur at 500Hz anyway. But when playing lower refresh rate titles, it is definitely an amazing feature. The Proximity Sensor is also amazing and is just one of the handful of tools that come in ASUS OLED CARE PRO. Which does a really job of slowing down the process of burn in on the display. The 3 Year warranty is great and ASUS DisplayWidget Center which also you to tinker with your monitor settings right on the desktop is Stellar. Lastly, I would like to state that with this monitor being HDR500 over HDR400 like found on previous OLED displays you can expect a overall brighter image and it is very pleasant.\n\nAspect Control Mode: Now this is probably one of the coolest features on ASUS monitors today but it works the best on here than I have ever seen on any display ever. To my knowledge this is the only 500Hz 1440p QD-OLED monitor that is capable of doing this with only tinkering in Nvidia Control Panel or the AMD equivalent and not using a thirds party program (which still doesn’t support the full 1440p resolution). But this monitor can do full 2560x1440 500Hz in its 24.5 inch mode and my goodness it is glorious. Being able to play at that resolution on a 500Hz 25” QD-OLED display is god-like. I definitely get the hoopla of playing competitive games at that size and being able to do it with the crazy specs of this display really makes for a fantastic experience.\n\nAt this moment in time this is easily the best looking competitive gaming monitor when it comes to fidelity, motion, refresh rate and colors. The Tandem variant is supposed to release later this year and if you prioritize oily black levels, a brighter image (540Hz on the higher tier model) and then also the 720p 720Hz dual mode that variant might be more ideal for you. But if you are fine with 500Hz (which is more then enough LOL) and a more vibrant monitor in color and realistic picture because of the QD-OLED Panel the XG27AQDPG might be the perfect monitor for you. I had ridiculously high expectations for this display and it still blew me away!\n\nOverall Score: 9.6/10",

I know that this is on the low end of the HDR cert. but I’m wondering what my best approach is.\n\nI’ve already noticed that in SDR, colours look vivid and punchy, but the display itself isn’t very bright, whereas in HDR, the opposite is true. I’ve also noticed that the brighter the picture on screen, the dimmer the display gets, which slightly irks me, and I don’t want that to happen. I’ve tested SDR and HDR in Overwatch and Hogwarts: Legacy so far (those are the two games I’m playing at the moment), and OW looks really washed out in HDR, and not much brighter than SDR due to its bright nature.\n\nWhat’s my best approach in terms of HDR? Should I just leave it off and sacrifice brightness to get punchy colours, or should I enable it just to play darker games and/or when I watch HDR content? I have already calibrated it using the Windows tool. Many thanks!",

    "selftext": "Firstly. WOW.\n\nI was honestly very skeptical about this monitor given that there are practically no reviews on it. But after using it and owning it I must say I am quite impressed and it sure exceeds my expectations.\n\nThe brightness 10/10. I flash banged myself on full screen white HDR video. (Would do it again). \n\nThe image quality 8.8/10. Yes it's not an OLED but this thing sure gives any matte OLED display a run for its money. I was actually going to buy the new Gigabyte MO27Q28G Tandem WOLED monitor however ultimately I was not prepared to buy disposable tech which burns in as I do a lot of productivity work. But compared to some matte OLED's I have seen this monitor is pretty damn close.\n\nLocal Dimming 8.5/10. Haloing is imperceptible to my eye. I can see some very minor blooming but to be totally honest I think most people are not gonna see it unless they look for it (Note I use this monitor with the Local Dimming set to Level 3). I don't mind loosing some details to get better blacks. \n\nGhosting would be a solid 9/10. There is some ghosting as per what I saw on the UFO test however to my eyes it's not a big deal and I don't notice it anyways and I would suspect that most people won't notice it anyways.\n\nThe panel is VERY responsive, I don't see slow reaction times. I run the display on the second fastest overdrive settings (out of box). \n\nI did notice something funny. HDR refused to work at 300Hz in Windows and the display wouldn't be detected as a HDR display unless I cracked it down to 240Hz. This is also on the latest FW update.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "ASUS ROG XG27AQDPG (500Hz 1440p QD-OLED) Written Review",
    "selftext": "ASUS ROG SWIFT XG27AQDPG REVIEW\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/JAbpUPTGknQ\n\nPS: I was sent this sample unit by ASUS ROG and have been testing it extensively for about two and half weeks.\n\nTL; DR: XG27AQDPG Review\n\nAesthetics: 8.5/10\n\nSemi-Glossy QD-OLED Panel: 9/10\n\nText Clarity: 8/10\n\nMotion Clarity: 10/10 (Best I’ve ever seen)\n\nMy PC Specs:\n\nGPU: ASUS ROG Astral GeForce RTX™ 5090 OC Edition\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor\n\nRAM: CORSAIR Dominator Titanium RGB DDR5 RAM 96GB\n\nSTORAGE: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280\n\nMy Background: I work in IT and I am also a content creator; I not only use my computer for work utilizing excel and Word among other IT related programs. But I also edit my own videos on my PC with Adobe Premiere as well. I play a large variety of games, everything from JRPGS, MOBAs, Third Person Shooters, Immersive Sims, FPS, Platformers and more! And one of my favorite games that I have been playing for the past 10 years is Overwatch which I have 2K+ hours and have peaked at high masters in competitive. The monitor feels like it is targeted toward competitive gamers that want a ridiculously high refresh rate display, excellent motion clarity and a gorgeous looking display.\n\nTested monitors -\n\n1440p QD-OLED: XG27AQDPG\n\n4K QD-OLED: PG32UCDM\n\nAesthetics & Stand: I really love the aesthetic of the ASUS ROG monitors. I know the hyper gamer look isn’t for everyone but I personally adore it. I love that this monitor once again has the flat stand instead of the “spider legs”. As an owner of a very large gaming mat and someone that moves his peripherals around all the time this monitor stand is perfect for my case usage. Just like always if you decide to use the backlight aura sync on the display, you will be presented with some excellent colors on the back of your display, really ideal if the back of your monitor is facing a wall.\n\n500Hz 1440p 27” QD-OLED Experience: So, first thing I would like to state is I haven’t been the owner of a 16:9 1440p monitor in almost 2 years. I did own the G9 Neo & G9 OLED at one point, but the last 1440p 16:9 I owned was the Asus PG27AQN, a 1440p 360Hz IPS display. At the time I loved it but as higher end 4K monitors started releasing I haven’t been interested in any 1440p displays again until now. I am definitely not saying a 1440p display is in anyway as sharp as a 32” or even 27” 4K display, but I think it’s sharp “enough” to say the least, especially with its specific case usage.\n\nNow to finally get to the point of why someone would get this monitor, which is the beautiful QD-OLED panel and downright ridiculous refresh rate of 500Hz. To say competitive games like Overwatch 2, Valorant, League of Legends, Rocket League and much more look absolutely ludicrous at 500Hz would be a huge understatement. The very high refresh rate, OLED motion clarity, QD-OLED vibrant color and accuracy, perfect black levels/infinite contrast, excellent picture quality all on a 1440p 27” display. In addition, with all the Asus ROG bells and whistles which consist of features like the proximity sensor, aspect control and so many other little things create in my opinion the most beautiful competitive gaming display you can experience today. Even as someone that glazes 4K 240Hz OLED monitors I highly prefer playing competitive games on XG27AQDPG over ANY OTHER DISPLAY I have ever used in my life. The level of fluidity and the crisp image is something you have to see in person to believe.\n\nText Clarity:\n\nI for sure missed the picture-perfect text clarity of a 4K display but with the PPI being 109. I had no problem reading text in games or even during regular desktop use, but just again be aware it will not be as sharp as a 4K monitor, even a 32” one which has a PPI of 138. Someone that is already used to a 27” probably won’t suffer from this issue but I did not like editing videos on a monitor this small. Regardless of resolution as someone that has been editing on 32” monitors and ultrawide displays I’m just not a fan of editing on a display so small. This isn’t the point of getting a monitor like this though and everything is still more then legible but I just wanted you’ll to be aware of my opinion on this.\n\nMotion clarity: Something as simple as reloading a gun in Overwatch 2 is overwhelming seeing in motion at 500Hz. The culmination of specs on this monitor is legitimately insane, so much so that playing competitive games on this monitor is somehow even more “beautiful” then when playing on 4K 240Hz. Which doesn’t really make sense since it’s a lower resolution but smoothness of the image almost makes the game feel more lifelike if that makes sense. I don’t feel like we will get to the point of displays being indistinguishable from real life until we hit that 700Hz+ point. But then again what truly makes this monitor so special is that in addition to having the very high refresh rate is it also looks freaking outstanding because it’s a QD-OLED display.\n\nTesting Of Competitive Games: So, I found that quite a few games were able to hit 500Hz even at max settings. But most were still able to hit it after tinkering with some settings even if it wasn’t able to consistently stay at above 500Hz (there were outliers though sadly). Now remember to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nCompetitive Games Experience\n\nOverwatch 2 Max Settings: 300-400 FPS\n\nOverwatch 2 Tinkered Settings 400-550 FPS\n\nRocket League: Max Settings 700+ FPS\n\nCSGO 2 Max & Tinkered Settings 300-400 FPS (Nothing I did got the fps close to 500 ☹)\n\nValorant: Max Settings 500-700 FPS\n\nLeague Of Legends Max or Tinkered Settings: 500+ FPS consistently\n\nMarvel Rivals Disclaimer Now this is a special case because this game is ridiculously CPU heavy with so many CPU calculations going one with things like Dr Strange portal. I was able to get like 300+ fps with only DLSS enabled raytracing off or on, and with frame gen like 350+. But playing with frame gen is kind of counterproductive to a competitive game so I recommend not using more than 2X MFG if anything.\n\nMarvel Rivals Max Settings DLSS With Ray Tracing: 250+\n\nMarvel Rivals: DLSS Without Ray Tracing 325+ FPS\n\nMarvel Rivals: Frame Gen Without/Without Ray Tracing 350+ FPS\n\nTesting of Non-Competitive Games\n\nSo, these next few games are games that I not only love playing but also showcasing on my channel when I am testing and doing showcases. But do take into account that to reach the 500fps threshold or even get close a mix of DLSS and Multi Frame Gen had to be used on some titles. But with none of these games being competitive, ridiculously low input lag isn’t necessarily needed (Arc Raiders & Big Maybe BF6 might be exceptions). And in my honest opinion what makes this monitor so darn special is you can dial up all the settings to max and get at least 150+ fps in like ever title. Or if the game is not demanding at all or with the help of DLSS and or Frame Gen, games that you wouldn’t even think would be able to even touch close to 500Hz had very surprising results. I tested more games but this gives you a gist of the performance you can get with different non-competitive titles. Remember again to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nNon-Competitive Games\n\nDoom Eternal: Max Settings with Ray Tracing 275-325 FPS\n\nDoom Eternal: Medium Settings & No Raytracing: 400-500 FPS\n\nHollow Knight: 800 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Max Settings, DLAA & Raytracing: 75-95 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Medium Settings DLSS Balanced with MFG 3X 250-300…4X: 330-375 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Low Settings DLSS Ultra Performance with MFG 4X 400-455 FPS\n\nReturnal: Max Settings No DLSS 150-212 FPS (Even with enabling just DLSS Quality-Ultra Performance there was no FPS increase)\n\nReturnal: Max Settings DLSS Quality & Frame Gen 325-375 FPS (Switching to other DLSS methods didn’t change framerate for me most likely because of the 5090 lol)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing No Frame Gen Enabled & Path Tracing 59-62 FPS (This might seem super low but being able to run this game natively at any resolution and get above 60 fps is really impressive. This is one of the most demanding games of all time!)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 90-100 FPS.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 100+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 150+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 190+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 200-350 FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 200+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 360+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 230+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 425+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Performance, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 450+ FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing, DLAA No Frame Gen: 140-150 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 2X: 240-270 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 3X: 325-340 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Medium Settings/Low Raytracing DLSS Ultra Performance Frame Gen 4X: 480-500 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & No Frame Gen 70-95 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 130-150 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 190-215 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4X 240-277 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 350-375 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 375-440 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4x 475-525 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA No Frame Gen 150-175 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 2X 250+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 3X 380+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 2X 344-380 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 3X 430-450 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 4X 500-540 FPS\n\nAsus Monitor Features: Firstly, the response time is 0.03ms if frame gen was not enabled every single movement of the mouse felt instantaneous unlike any other monitor I’ve used. In addition, you also have OLED Anti Flicker 2.0 which to my knowledge is an exclusive feature to ASUS monitors. In addition, the monitor comes equipped ELMB (BFI) which does a good job of removing motion blur on their displays I will be honest though you’re not really seeing much blur at 500Hz anyway. But when playing lower refresh rate titles, it is definitely an amazing feature. The Proximity Sensor is also amazing and is just one of the handful of tools that come in ASUS OLED CARE PRO. Which does a really job of slowing down the process of burn in on the display. The 3 Year warranty is great and ASUS DisplayWidget Center which also you to tinker with your monitor settings right on the desktop is Stellar. Lastly, I would like to state that with this monitor being HDR500 over HDR400 like found on previous OLED displays you can expect a overall brighter image and it is very pleasant.\n\nAspect Control Mode: Now this is probably one of the coolest features on ASUS monitors today but it works the best on here than I have ever seen on any display ever. To my knowledge this is the only 500Hz 1440p QD-OLED monitor that is capable of doing this with only tinkering in Nvidia Control Panel or the AMD equivalent and not using a thirds party program (which still doesn’t support the full 1440p resolution). But this monitor can do full 2560x1440 500Hz in its 24.5 inch mode and my goodness it is glorious. Being able to play at that resolution on a 500Hz 25” QD-OLED display is god-like. I definitely get the hoopla of playing competitive games at that size and being able to do it with the crazy specs of this display really makes for a fantastic experience.\n\nAt this moment in time this is easily the best looking competitive gaming monitor when it comes to fidelity, motion, refresh rate and colors. The Tandem variant is supposed to release later this year and if you prioritize oily black levels, a brighter image (540Hz on the higher tier model) and then also the 720p 720Hz dual mode that variant might be more ideal for you. But if you are fine with 500Hz (which is more then enough LOL) and a more vibrant monitor in color and realistic picture because of the QD-OLED Panel the XG27AQDPG might be the perfect monitor for you. I had ridiculously high expectations for this display and it still blew me away!\n\nOverall Score: 9.6/10",

I know that this is on the low end of the HDR cert. but I’m wondering what my best approach is.\n\nI’ve already noticed that in SDR, colours look vivid and punchy, but the display itself isn’t very bright, whereas in HDR, the opposite is true. I’ve also noticed that the brighter the picture on screen, the dimmer the display gets, which slightly irks me, and I don’t want that to happen. I’ve tested SDR and HDR in Overwatch and Hogwarts: Legacy so far (those are the two games I’m playing at the moment), and OW looks really washed out in HDR, and not much brighter than SDR due to its bright nature.\n\nWhat’s my best approach in terms of HDR? Should I just leave it off and sacrifice brightness to get punchy colours, or should I enable it just to play darker games and/or when I watch HDR content? I have already calibrated it using the Windows tool. Many thanks!",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 - Maybe Buy 2 Headphones Instead",
    "selftext": "**TLDR:** Good sound, good customization, bad comfort, finnicky connectivity, high price. Audeze Maxwell + Momentum 4 for $50 more (can be less if you're cool with open box) do more things better.\n\n**The positives:**\n\n* **One of the best ever sounding closed backs**, definitely the best I've heard with ANC (vs Bathys, XM5/XM6, Momentum 4, QC Ultra, Airpods Max), competes with or beats many wired closed backs. I think they fall just short of Audeze Maxwell with some EQ adjustments, but those headphones are very close to my tastes out of the box so YMMV.\n* Pairs great tuning with anatomy measurements to normalize low end performance between different users and re-seating.\n* **PEQ** to dial in to your tastes\n* **Low latency** (matched my monitor's input lag near identically in gaming mode by my perception))and high res Bluetooth connections with the dongle. I think Sennheiser are getting close to or even beating that 30ms latency in the low latency dongle mode\n* **The sound with the dongle is excellent**, even in the low latency mode\n* Solid all around functionality as a portable ANC headphone\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n* **Comfort is not great**. Fairly shallow pads that compress easily cause heat and pressure on the pinna, and I don't have big ears. They (and Momentum 4) also have an odd cup angle that requires you to rotate the headband forward which is sub-optimal. For comparison, I find the Bathys comfier in the pads but slightly less comfy in the headband. I hate the XM5/XM6 comfort-wise, 630 are an improvement. APM are comfier and QC Ultra are much much comfier.\n* The WC Freeze pads for Momentum 4 fit and are way comfier but hurt the seal a lot (which makes ANC and sound both much worse) making those pads a complete no-go IMO.\n* No 2.4GHz on the dongle\n* Finicky pairing and touch controls. Same issues as Momentum 4.\n* **No ability to use the mic + get full sound quality at the same time**\n* No options for a boom mic\n* **Boring looking and no color options,** and they are a bit too thick in the cups to look normal vs other ANC.\n* **Expensive**: **You can get a pair of Momentum 4 + an Audeze Maxwell for $50 more**, and less than the price of the HDB 630 if you are willing to do refurbs/open box. Maxwell is comfier to me (weight doesn't bother me, capra strap improves even more) and sounds better + has the boom mic and low latency via 2.4ghz. Momentum 4 sounds pretty good with the built in graphic EQ and not that much worse than HDB 630 if you use another app for PEQ.\n\n**Deeper Sound Breakdown**: These headphones were very quickly determined to be not worth the money for me, so these impressions are not my most thorough. As with all sound impressions, YMMV.\n\n* **Tuning**\n   * They are **a bit mid-bass focused** for me, sounding a bit bloated in the low end. Luckily the blending into the mids is very clean and not boomy. The extension is good, but the midbass focus also reduces how apparent this is\n   * **The mids are very nice.** Perhaps a bit lacking in energy, but this can be fixed with a peak filter most likely somewhere between 1-3k. I often find 2-2.5k helps with this a lot.\n   * **They are very natural sounding in timbre**. This is the one thing that they solidly beat the Momentum 4 at even with the M4 dialed in with the in-app EQ.\n   * **The treble very even and pleasant albeit** maybe a tad too relaxed for me.\n* **Technicalities**\n   * **Bass texture is lacking.** Even with a filter reigning in the midbass, they lacked the grit and texture in the low-end that I really look for in a headphone\n   * **Treble is a bit oversmoothed, leading to a perceived lack of resolution**. This may actually be affecting the bass texture situation.\n   * **They aren't that punchy or energetic**. The midbass focus and a bit of relaxed 1-3k lead to a bit of dullness. Kick drums don't impact as nicely as I'd like, and higher voices don't come through as strongly as I think they should.\n   * **They are a well-controlled but not super 'fast'.** Especially with the bass reduced, they do give the impression of not being sloppy or slow, but they aren't super quick in terms of attack or decay.\n   * **A note about imaging/soundstage**: I am a speaker guy first and foremost. I don't get any impression of verticality or layering from any headphones unless the music is mastered specifically with headphones and spaciousness in mind. I find that production to be very rare. The things I do notice are imaging and distance. **The imaging is good; t**his is mostly just down to consistent channel matching across the FR. **Spaciousness is exactly what you'd expect.** They aren't completely inside my head, but they give no impression the sound is coming from a distance outside of the headphone. This is typical for me for closed backs.\n* **EQ Suggestions:**\n   * Peak filter around 120hz, q\\~1, -1-3db to get rid of the bass bloat\n   * If you are more of a bass roll-off fan, do a bass shelf with 2-5db reduction.\n   * Find the area between 1-3k that increasing with a q filter of \\~1 by 1-3db gives you more energy and punch.\n   * Find any over-emphasis in the low treble, 3-7k and reduce that if needed.\n   * See if you have any aggressive peaks above 5k, and reduce them with smaller q value filters\n   * Add a treble shelf to boost detail if needed.\n\n**Summary:** excellent sound especially with PEQ, mediocre comfort, boring design that looks a bit bulky on head, good latency and sound via dongle, no boom mic, sound is bad when using mic, and pricey vs a dedicated ANC + dedicated gaming headphone. I like the Maxwell + Momentum 4 enough to make it a no-go for me. **But if the mic situation and comfort are good for you, they're very hard to beat as an all-around single solution.**",

    "selftext": "Listening to them as I write this. Technically a fist impression but like I know what I'm listening for and done all my test songs so I feel confident on how I feel. They sound great, shocker right. The big thing is music just sounds correct in these. Good bass extension so still fun. Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Quick Impressions",
    "selftext": "Just got these in and wow — out of the box they sound superb. The tuning is really neutral and everything comes together seamlessly. The bass has great extension and presence — it adds solid weight and heft to the music without bleeding into the mids or muddying up vocals. Speaking of vocals, they’re insanely clear, super natural, and have that spot-on timbre Sennheiser does so well. Instruments sound very lifelike with great clarity and separation too.\n\nTreble is crisp and airy but never harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is actually excellent for a closed-back set, and imaging is really precise. Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other — everything has its space.\n\nHaven’t played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it’s nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony’s level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it’s impressive how well the ANC works — definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn’t.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn’t quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it’s not far behind — way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts — 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I’d still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I’m really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic — clean, balanced, natural — and they’re super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic — super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality’s surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

    "selftext": "I am a regular music listener and always use my headphones to do so, however using them for a long time builds up a lot of earwax which often completely shuts off my ear after waking up. The mesh around it too get earwax on them, needing to clean them every few days.  \nIt's just become a regular routine for me to clean off my earwax atleast once a day to avoid getting my ears shut off due to the wax. Was not too confident with hydrogen peroxide, so got an ear camera cleaning tool by bebird, and honestly it is quite good to use.  \nThe scoop is silicone based so i dont feel much sceptical about it to not put in my ear... However for my headphones i dont have any solution to the wax which gets stuck on the mesh, even after trying to get it off by toothpick and small objects it just stays there. Removing it would obviously damage the pre glued seal which would have to be reapplied then. Any suggestions for removing the earwax from the mesh of the headphone..?",

Once I get that sorted, I will definitely measure them, but for now you are going to have to rely on my impressions.\n\nThe bass is not bad at all! It is tight, quick, and honestly fun. While it has a midbass peak somewhere, likely at 200hz which is common among closed backs, I very much do not dislike it! The midrange is a little forward, and the treble has some peaks that I am very certain is down to the resin chamber.\n\nThis is purely a for fun project, not final as I plan to do stamped metal as the actual chamber for my closed back. There is fog that generates inside the chambers which doesn't look pretty, but overall, I think looks very cool! Everything is hand assembled and designed by me.\n\nThe pads are Yaxi ST pads, the drivers are 40mm titanium speakers that I am currently working on with a manufacturer, and the resin chamber is made by facfox.",

    "selftext": "That cord always ends up tangled in my pocket, a tiny knot of chaos I have to spend minutes undoing. My clumsy fingers wrestle with the plastic wire, while people with wireless earbuds would’ve already finished two songs by now. It’s been too long—its rubber coating has started to get sticky, the volume button on the controller feels jammed, and sometimes there’s a faint electric buzz in the right ear. Maybe it’s time to replace it.\n\nBut I just can’t quit that little click when I plug it into my phone.\nSo soft, yet so solid.\nLike the sound of an old door lock turning, shutting the whole world out.\n\nWalking is the worst. The wire swings across my chest, rustling against my jacket’s zipper. On the stairs I have to hold it tight, or it’ll catch on the railing. Windy days are even worse—the wire tangles in my hair and pulls hard enough to hurt. I still remember that rainy day when my best friend and I huddled under the convenience store awning. She naturally took off her right earbud and handed it to me:\n“Listen—this intro is amazing.”\nA raindrop slid down the wire into my collar, cold and sharp. We stood together in that shared ninety centimeters of space, and the warmth of her body seemed to flow through the copper line. For a moment, the rain really did feel like decoration.\n\nNow my friend wears thousand-yuan noise-cancelling headphones, walking with confidence, never worrying about tangled cords. She says technology is great—it’s freed us from the wire.\nBut I’m still using this glitchy old pair, the left side fine, the right side buzzing now and then—only working if I hold it at just the right angle. Like me, struggling in that night without an ending—broken, stuttering, unclear.\n\nYesterday on my way to class, the wire snagged on my backpack strap again. I crouched to untie the knot while the person behind me clicked their tongue in annoyance. But honestly, I kind of enjoy this clumsiness. Wireless feels too perfect—perfect like a lie. The spotless charging case, the precise touch controls, never tangled, never messy. But my life is a tangle—why should my music be perfectly ordered?\n\nThis wired earphone has been with me for nearly three years. The braided cable is pilling, the gold plating on the plug worn thin. These flaws are like folded corners in an old diary, recording every ordinary day. Of course a new pair would be better—sleek and shiny—but it doesn’t know my ears. It hasn’t heard the song I played on repeat after you left during that fight. It doesn’t know the white noise that lulled me to sleep on sleepless nights.\n\nLast month I almost replaced it. I even placed the order for the newest model—then canceled it at 3 a.m. The customer service agent asked if there was a problem with the product.\n“No,” I said. “The problem’s with me.”\n—Nostalgia is a sickness with no cure.\n\nToday, as the taxi climbed the overpass, the right ear suddenly went silent. I instinctively twisted the yellowed plug, feeling the rough edge of the tape under my fingers. The river below flowed calmly, and in my left ear Eason Chan was singing:\n‘The water knows well—it’s my duty to cherish the flowers.’\nThe music sounded thin, like a bird that had lost one wing.\nAnd still, I never replaced these earphones.\n\nThe right one is dead now. So be it. One side is enough.\nThis worn-out cord I clung to—\nin the end, it couldn’t keep the two worlds playing in sync.",

At first, I was slightly afraid they were fakes, but after listening, I am fairly sure they are the real deal.\n\nTheir value is STRONG. The cable is braided below the Y-split. Makes them appear a bit more refined, I guess. These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

    "selftext": "Hey there,\n\njust want to share some of my feelings and likings about my current Hifi-Desktop-Setup which is build of\n\n1. Eversolo DAP-A6 Gen 2 Streamer  \n2. Burson Conductor Voyager Max DAC/AMP  \n3. ModHouse Tungsten DS V1\n\n \n\nI had a lot of headphones before like Mezes Empy II or Elite, DCAs Expanse, ZMFs Atrium and Verite open, Finals D8000 Pro and Hifimans HE1000 Stealth. After all of them I can say after one moth I own the Tungsten, the Tungsten is the clear winner for me.\n\nBase is such punchy and crisp at the same time and goes so crazy deep. Holy smokes. Its also wonderful layered.\n\nMids are present but not so much in your face as Finals D8000 Pro. Its more like the HE1000 Stealth.\n\nTreble is smooth and not fatiguing overall. It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

    "title": "Comparison between HE600, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, FT1 Pro, FT7,  AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1.",
    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide.\n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs.\n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much.\n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Vocals sound muffled.\n* The soundstage is small.\n* I hate it.\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, Just want to clarify that this is not an \"objective review\", these are my subjective impressions, and I stand by what I wrote. As I said at the very beginning, I have my own priorities when it comes to headphones. I know some people really enjoy Sony MDR-MV1 and I am happy you enjoyed them. Cheers! \n\nIf you have any questions leave a comment I will answer them",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/4ulrwz8x1rwf1.png?width=2130&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cd2aba14f52d8ec06ac38dc280de34349e96b76\n\nSo I've eq'ed before but usual more towards a specific target frequency rather than what I want in my sound. The FT1 coming from some really good planar iems is an amazing leap forward for paying basically the same price. I ordered better ear pads, a capra strap. These will be the ultimate cans. Unfortunately the description on the graph site isn't detailed enough for me personally to truly understand so now we are here.\n\nI feel like the ft1's sound is very relaxing. The bass is phenomenal and very deep and visceral. The vocals are smooth. Treble is good for long term listening I'll say. But I feel like I can get a bit more excitement from these headphones. I listen to a lot of rap, a lot of female vocalist from all genres, house, dance, alternative. So bass is a common thing amongst all these genres. Boom, I added a bit more sub bass to give me some extra feelings. I've heard the sennheiser having amazing mids and since the ft1's are mildly v shaped, I raised the mids a tad bit. So I kinda eq'ed my graph to reflect the HDB 630 lower and upper mids and kept the rest the same. It's for sure, much more engaging vocally. I never realized how laid back vocals were. I will try the 6XX mids and see if I like it more. I know drivers play a big part in how sound truly is portrayed. But It made a good enough difference.\n\nNow I'm curious on some things I've noticed. What is the peak in the ft1's line around 1.8K. What is this specific frequency range responsible for. I also noticed the ft1's has a lot less treble in the 6-7K range than most cans. I felt like treble is the feeling I felt on my bones in the front of my face. I did notice raising this area was responsible for this feeling, that's maybe why these aren't as fatiguing to listen to long term. I'm a bit sensitive to treble but even the s12 planars I eq'ed like -2db from 6-7.5K and it was perfect. So I can for sure bump this area up a bit. It's interesting because my friend can use the dt 770's at high volume no issues. I could never lol. Those are some bright cans. I used to have em a long time ago that's why I have em on the graph for comparison.\n\nMy last question is eq'ing 8K or higher worth it and what immediate effects would I notice bumping this region?\n\nThanks for feedback, genuinely I'm such an immersive listener. I like to feel my music truly. If anyone here is a fan on the album Kiss Land by the weeknd. Arguably the most immersive album I ever heard. I'm very big on concept and immersion! even for video games.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI’ve been experimenting with some EQ presets and wanted to share them for feedback and to see what you’ve all tried as well.\n\nFor this experiment, I used AutoEq's Custom Parametric Eq for the AZ100.\n\n**Custom 1** is **strictly the Harman target curve,** every band matches it as closely as possible.  \n**Custom 2** and **Custom 3** are my personal tweaks designed to make things a bit more fun and engaging while still staying grounded in the Harman philosophy.\n\nThe reason some numbers look a bit extreme is because **“flat” on these earbuds isn’t truly flat**, so Custom 1 compensates for that to accurately reflect Harman’s response.\n\n**Custom 1 (Strict Harman Reference):**  \n\\-9, -3, +3, 0, +2, 0, +2, -10\n\n**Custom 2 (+Bass):**  \n\\-3, -3, +3, 0, +2, 0, +2, -10\n\n**Custom 3 (++Bass):**  \n\\+1, -3, +3, 0, +1, +1, +2, -10\n\nCustom 2 boosts the bass for a fuller low end.  \nCustom 3 goes further, the **4 kHz and 8 kHz bands** are slightly adjusted to **compensate for the bass lift** so it still aligns with the Harman curve in the upper mids and treble region, no change needed to the 250hz range.\n\nCurious how these sound to others. I understand this is a subjective thing, but what EQs have you guys tried?",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nI’m starting up a YouTube channel where I talk about Hi-Fi gear, but from the perspective of someone who mostly listens to bass-heavy music: hip-hop, R&B, reggaeton, metal, all the stuff that doesn’t usually get talked about much in the Hi-Fi space.\n\nI’m not asking for buying advice or comparisons, just looking to get some thoughts from people here about what kind of topics or angles would be cool to cover.\n\nI’ve got a few video ideas lined up already:\n\n1: Intro to the hobby : kind of an overview of what “Hi-Fi”actually is, why it’s fun even if your playlists are full of bass-heavy stuff, some common misconceptions, and how EQ can really help shape your sound. Also sort of some intro recs on how you can get a great setup for the same price you could wait a pair of ANC headphones or even less. \n\n2: Wireless ANC headphones: these are where most people start with higher-end gear, so I wanted to do something that talks about that whole category and how it fits into the hobby, especially for people who like tweaking sound profiles and are into bass heavy genres. \n\n3: Talking about my own gear: I’ve got a few headphones I love (HE1K Unveiled, Meze Empyrean 1) and thought it’d be fun to share what I like about them, how they respond to EQ, and how to get the sound you want out of your own setup.\n\nI think there’s room for more content that connects the “audiophile” side of things with the kind of music a lot of us listen to every day, but isn’t really represented in reviews or general talk of the hobby. Sort of give my thoughts on finding the perfect balance of a good thump in the bass, and a super clear rest of the song which just makes the music feel incredibly natural. If you’ve got ideas for what you’d want to see in that kind of channel, I’d love to hear them!\n\nAppreciate anyone who takes the time to read, I’ll share the channel later once the first video’s up. Thanks guys!\n\nEDIT: one last thing, I speak Spanish fluently so I’m thinking of making a Spanish channel as well, if you’re here and speak Spanish and would like that lmk! Thanks! ",

I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025.

    "title": "An Up-To-Date Review of the Bose Open Ultra’s",
    "selftext": "For the TLDR: They’re fantastic buds that I do recommend if you have the extra cash, but if they’re on sale, they’re absolutely worth getting. \n\n**Sound**: I’m not an audiophile, musician, or any sort of person that knows what they’re talking about when it comes to sound quality. So take my opinion here for the normie opinion that it is when I say I think they sound fantastic. I’ve always been impressed with Bose’s acoustics, their products just seem to fill the room or your world in a way I haven’t seen with other products, and these earbuds are no different - particularly with their immersive audio mode. Which makes them feel (I’m choosing the word feel on purpose) like in-ears.   \nRegarding the immersive audio, I think it’s incredibly cool. What it does is employ some acoustics tricks to make the sound like it’s coming from a source in your room. It’s *very* convincing and actually confused me at first when I turned them on thinking there was sound coming from somewhere else when it was in fact the earbuds. The “source” location is placed front and slightly above you so that it sounds like the sound is all around you but will stay stationary if you move your head (which really makes the effect pop). If you move your head and stay in the new position for a bit, the buds will move the source after a few seconds to recreate the “all around” sound again. The “motion” mode just makes the reorientation happen constantly so it’s always slightly following behind your movement. I’ve found myself mostly just always leaving it in motion mode even when sitting and only really putting it in still mode when I want to play with the effect. Switching to the mode does impact the sound, but its just as if the equalizer got changed and you can adjust it out with the equalizer. \n\n**The open ear design:** I’m a huge fan. If I want to block out the world, I have a pair of QC35’s. I use these for anytime I want to be able to hear what’s going on around me or just won’t want to wear a bulky pair of cans and the open ear design is fantastic for it. that said, It does have a noticeable drawback in that it’s easy for outside noise to drown them out. Higher pitched sounds like clanking and crashes are what are going to do it the most, and car noises on busy streets will make you have to turn them up a decent amount to still hear what’s you’re listening to clearly - particularly if you’re listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Personally, I think the trade off is worth it because it’s not a *huge* problem, but it is a noticeable one. \n\n**Comfort:** I have extremely sensitive ears, basically anything that is touching my ears will make them ache after a while. Even beanies will make my ears hurt. So I was absolutely thrilled to find that these earbuds provided a pretty significant reduction in discomfort compared to any other pair of earbuds I’ve worn in my entire life. They’re not painless, and the discomfort is moved to a different location on the ear because of their unique placement, but it’s still a pretty significant improvement and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve also never had them fall out or been even remotely concerned about it. \n\nThey are meant to be placed as close to the ear canal as you can get them, for most people, this will be at a slight angle downwards with the hook placed just above the earlobe, but you can place them pretty much anywhere in the “hook zone” which is anywhere between the lobule and start antihelix of the outer ear, so long as the speakers are inside the general concha (I hope I got the terms right I had to google ear anatomy). You can calibrate the immersion mode to however you’ve placed them on your ear so you don’t need to worry about sound quality reduction, but volume does get noticeably reduced and it gets easier for outside noise to overpower them as the speakers get farther from your ear canal. \n\n**Connectivity:** This is a field where early reviews of the product were rather negative, however Bose seems to have addressed the concerns in their firmware updates since release because I’ve had no issues. They paired easily, immediately reconnect/disconnect when taking them in and out of the case, and easily switch between my paired devices without problem. They do lack a lot of the apple ecosystem bells and whistles you get from a pair of AirPods or Beats, but that’s not Bose’s fault so I’m overlooking it. \n\n**Battery Life:** They have served me great and I’ve yet to have them die on me before I was ready. I’m not using them for all day shifts or anything, but their advertised battery life seems pretty accurate to me, maybe even conservative. The immersion mode does reduce the battery life, but not so much it’s caused me issues, and I usually have them in immersion mode. \n\n**Calls:** This is another field where a lot of early reviews said they were awful, but after having had a few calls, and asking how I sounded, nobody said I sound particularly bad. One or two did note I didn’t sound the clearest, but said it wasn’t enough to be an issue. I know Bose put out a couple firmware updates to address those early complaints and it seems like they succeeded. \n\n**Price:** This is the kicker, at $300, the cost is a big ask. And whether or not it’s worth it will really just entirely depend on your personal finances. I got mine on sale and only paid $240 (I also cashed in reward money and got a limited edition pair which were $375 full price. In the end I only ended up paying \\~$40 out of pocket) so I’m super happy with them and absolutely think they were worth it. If I had paid the full $375 - or even $300 for a normal pair however, I’m not so sure. They’re fantastic, but with them being priced so far above their competition, I definitely wouldn’t have bought them if they weren’t on sale. For the general consumer though, I think they’re a “buy on sale” set of earbuds just because of the price despite how good they are. However, if you happen to be rather wealthy and aren’t so concerned about price, they’re 100% worth grabbing. \n\n**Overall: I love them.** I strongly recommend grabbing them if you’re looking for a pair of open ears (or even in ears). It also doesn’t hurt that they’re rather stylish and kinda look like an ear ring. They sound great, feel great, work great, and stay in your ears great. The price is high, so I’d say wait for a sale if you’re more financially constrained, but if you‘re not, definitely grab them. ",

I wasn't really tampering with any part of it, but just keeping the speakers rotated flat in the case (required given that it's not the biggest case) which must have resulted in the plastic joint breaking off. Soon it just came off really loose and ended in the right speaker separating\n\nThis really has me distrusting plastic headphones, so i'm not gonna take those anymore.

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

After testing ones from Bose, Sony, Skullcandy, and Baseus, I’ve been using the XH1 a lot. The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ. It also folds easily, and the ear pads are soft and comfy. I’m not an expert, but it’s been a solid experience overall. ",

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "title": "Audiophile Verdict of Bose QC Ultra 2 Headphones: DO NOT BUY 1ST GEN!",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "selftext": "DO NOT RECOMMEND OR PURCHASE!!\n\nThe Heavys H1H headphones, marketed for metal fans with an eight-driver design, promised durability and premium sound for $485. Instead, they delivered a flimsy build, muddy audio, and abysmal customer service, making this purchase a complete letdown.\nDurability: Shockingly Fragile\nThe website claims the H1H survived 1.8m drops onto hard floors, but this is a blatant lie. My headphones’ headband snapped in two after a mere 0.4m drop onto a soft carpeted floor. For a premium product, this fragility is outrageous. The 308g weight also made them uncomfortable for extended wear, and the satin finish attracted fingerprints, further cheapening the experience.\n\nCustomer Service: Insulting Response,\n\nWhen I contacted Heavys about the broken headband, their response was slow and unhelpful. After days of generic emails, they offered a 25% discount on another purchase. Why would I buy a faulty product again? This dismissive attitude left me feeling cheated and ignored.\n\nSound and Features: Substandard,\n\nThe sound was bass-heavy and muddy, burying vocals and guitars in tracks like Iron Maiden’s Run to the Hills. The app’s EQ barely helped, and the soundstage felt cramped. The “Hell Blocker” noise cancellation was ineffective against basic background noise, and clunky buttons made adjustments a hassle.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Heavys H1H are a massive disappointment. A fragile build, false durability claims, poor sound, and insulting customer service make these headphones a waste of money. Metal fans, steer clear and invest in something reliable.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 - Maybe Buy 2 Headphones Instead",
    "selftext": "**TLDR:** Good sound, good customization, bad comfort, finnicky connectivity, high price. Audeze Maxwell + Momentum 4 for $50 more (can be less if you're cool with open box) do more things better.\n\n**The positives:**\n\n* **One of the best ever sounding closed backs**, definitely the best I've heard with ANC (vs Bathys, XM5/XM6, Momentum 4, QC Ultra, Airpods Max), competes with or beats many wired closed backs. I think they fall just short of Audeze Maxwell with some EQ adjustments, but those headphones are very close to my tastes out of the box so YMMV.\n* Pairs great tuning with anatomy measurements to normalize low end performance between different users and re-seating.\n* **PEQ** to dial in to your tastes\n* **Low latency** (matched my monitor's input lag near identically in gaming mode by my perception))and high res Bluetooth connections with the dongle. I think Sennheiser are getting close to or even beating that 30ms latency in the low latency dongle mode\n* **The sound with the dongle is excellent**, even in the low latency mode\n* Solid all around functionality as a portable ANC headphone\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n* **Comfort is not great**. Fairly shallow pads that compress easily cause heat and pressure on the pinna, and I don't have big ears. They (and Momentum 4) also have an odd cup angle that requires you to rotate the headband forward which is sub-optimal. For comparison, I find the Bathys comfier in the pads but slightly less comfy in the headband. I hate the XM5/XM6 comfort-wise, 630 are an improvement. APM are comfier and QC Ultra are much much comfier.\n* The WC Freeze pads for Momentum 4 fit and are way comfier but hurt the seal a lot (which makes ANC and sound both much worse) making those pads a complete no-go IMO.\n* No 2.4GHz on the dongle\n* Finicky pairing and touch controls. Same issues as Momentum 4.\n* **No ability to use the mic + get full sound quality at the same time**\n* No options for a boom mic\n* **Boring looking and no color options,** and they are a bit too thick in the cups to look normal vs other ANC.\n* **Expensive**: **You can get a pair of Momentum 4 + an Audeze Maxwell for $50 more**, and less than the price of the HDB 630 if you are willing to do refurbs/open box. Maxwell is comfier to me (weight doesn't bother me, capra strap improves even more) and sounds better + has the boom mic and low latency via 2.4ghz. Momentum 4 sounds pretty good with the built in graphic EQ and not that much worse than HDB 630 if you use another app for PEQ.\n\n**Deeper Sound Breakdown**: These headphones were very quickly determined to be not worth the money for me, so these impressions are not my most thorough. As with all sound impressions, YMMV.\n\n* **Tuning**\n   * They are **a bit mid-bass focused** for me, sounding a bit bloated in the low end. Luckily the blending into the mids is very clean and not boomy. The extension is good, but the midbass focus also reduces how apparent this is\n   * **The mids are very nice.** Perhaps a bit lacking in energy, but this can be fixed with a peak filter most likely somewhere between 1-3k. I often find 2-2.5k helps with this a lot.\n   * **They are very natural sounding in timbre**. This is the one thing that they solidly beat the Momentum 4 at even with the M4 dialed in with the in-app EQ.\n   * **The treble very even and pleasant albeit** maybe a tad too relaxed for me.\n* **Technicalities**\n   * **Bass texture is lacking.** Even with a filter reigning in the midbass, they lacked the grit and texture in the low-end that I really look for in a headphone\n   * **Treble is a bit oversmoothed, leading to a perceived lack of resolution**. This may actually be affecting the bass texture situation.\n   * **They aren't that punchy or energetic**. The midbass focus and a bit of relaxed 1-3k lead to a bit of dullness. Kick drums don't impact as nicely as I'd like, and higher voices don't come through as strongly as I think they should.\n   * **They are a well-controlled but not super 'fast'.** Especially with the bass reduced, they do give the impression of not being sloppy or slow, but they aren't super quick in terms of attack or decay.\n   * **A note about imaging/soundstage**: I am a speaker guy first and foremost. I don't get any impression of verticality or layering from any headphones unless the music is mastered specifically with headphones and spaciousness in mind. I find that production to be very rare. The things I do notice are imaging and distance. **The imaging is good; t**his is mostly just down to consistent channel matching across the FR. **Spaciousness is exactly what you'd expect.** They aren't completely inside my head, but they give no impression the sound is coming from a distance outside of the headphone. This is typical for me for closed backs.\n* **EQ Suggestions:**\n   * Peak filter around 120hz, q\\~1, -1-3db to get rid of the bass bloat\n   * If you are more of a bass roll-off fan, do a bass shelf with 2-5db reduction.\n   * Find the area between 1-3k that increasing with a q filter of \\~1 by 1-3db gives you more energy and punch.\n   * Find any over-emphasis in the low treble, 3-7k and reduce that if needed.\n   * See if you have any aggressive peaks above 5k, and reduce them with smaller q value filters\n   * Add a treble shelf to boost detail if needed.\n\n**Summary:** excellent sound especially with PEQ, mediocre comfort, boring design that looks a bit bulky on head, good latency and sound via dongle, no boom mic, sound is bad when using mic, and pricey vs a dedicated ANC + dedicated gaming headphone. I like the Maxwell + Momentum 4 enough to make it a no-go for me. **But if the mic situation and comfort are good for you, they're very hard to beat as an all-around single solution.**",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Quick Impressions",
    "selftext": "Just got these in and wow — out of the box they sound superb. The tuning is really neutral and everything comes together seamlessly. The bass has great extension and presence — it adds solid weight and heft to the music without bleeding into the mids or muddying up vocals. Speaking of vocals, they’re insanely clear, super natural, and have that spot-on timbre Sennheiser does so well. Instruments sound very lifelike with great clarity and separation too.\n\nTreble is crisp and airy but never harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is actually excellent for a closed-back set, and imaging is really precise. Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other — everything has its space.\n\nHaven’t played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it’s nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony’s level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it’s impressive how well the ANC works — definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn’t.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn’t quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it’s not far behind — way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts — 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I’d still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I’m really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic — clean, balanced, natural — and they’re super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic — super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality’s surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

    "selftext": "Listening to them as I write this. Technically a fist impression but like I know what I'm listening for and done all my test songs so I feel confident on how I feel. They sound great, shocker right. The big thing is music just sounds correct in these. Good bass extension so still fun. Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

    "selftext": "Frequency curve taken from [hangout.audio](http://hangout.audio) , I hope St. Crin forgives me.\n\nGot them new for 5€ (shipping included) from a private seller on the electronic bay who got them bundled with their phone but didn't need them. At first, I was slightly afraid they were fakes, but after listening, I am fairly sure they are the real deal.\n\nTheir value is STRONG. The cable is braided below the Y-split. Makes them appear a bit more refined, I guess. These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide.\n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs.\n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much.\n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Vocals sound muffled.\n* The soundstage is small.\n* I hate it.\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, Just want to clarify that this is not an \"objective review\", these are my subjective impressions, and I stand by what I wrote. As I said at the very beginning, I have my own priorities when it comes to headphones. I know some people really enjoy Sony MDR-MV1 and I am happy you enjoyed them. Cheers! \n\nIf you have any questions leave a comment I will answer them",

    "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nI'm here today to ask you about the dongle DAC's that is usable with Windows-based PC.\n\nI know there are a lot of them for different price points, and I guess I didn't need them too much, because I only got easy to drive SGH 9500 and Beyers 770 Pro X LE (that are stupidly broken by themselves in the can connection points with very light gentle use and now I'm awaiting for them to return from the service), but now I want to try IEM's and I guess I need a better source then my motherboard audio.\n\nFor the start I don't want to get anything crazy, simply because I'm in Ukraine and I try to keep my purchases relatively cheap, so that's why I want to go under 100 USD with dongle or something portable.\n\nBut as far as I know the things that work well with the phones may have some issues on the PC side of things.\n\nSo I need a dongle, that have a clear sound and also didn't fall asleep, disconnect rapidly or have driver problems on the PC.\n\nI will get something better if there will be safe again, but for now I need something reliable and fun.\n\nI was thinking about Apple Dongle and TRN Black Pearl, but I heard that TRN one have some issues with entering a standby mode so it can fade out notifications etc. And the driver is not too good for the PC use.\n\nI'll happily read all your recommendations, thank you so much in advance.  \n",

    "selftext": "I am a regular music listener and always use my headphones to do so, however using them for a long time builds up a lot of earwax which often completely shuts off my ear after waking up. The mesh around it too get earwax on them, needing to clean them every few days.  \nIt's just become a regular routine for me to clean off my earwax atleast once a day to avoid getting my ears shut off due to the wax. Was not too confident with hydrogen peroxide, so got an ear camera cleaning tool by bebird, and honestly it is quite good to use.  \nThe scoop is silicone based so i dont feel much sceptical about it to not put in my ear... However for my headphones i dont have any solution to the wax which gets stuck on the mesh, even after trying to get it off by toothpick and small objects it just stays there. Removing it would obviously damage the pre glued seal which would have to be reapplied then. Any suggestions for removing the earwax from the mesh of the headphone..?",

    "selftext": "I was first drugged into using IEMs by a friend — that’s how it all started. I began with budget models like the Tangzu Wan’er, then moved up to the Truthear Hexa and Kefine Delci. I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025. Huge shout-out to SLaudio and all the amazing people in their discord community\n\nHappy listening, guys",

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

The FT1 coming from some really good planar iems is an amazing leap forward for paying basically the same price. I ordered better ear pads, a capra strap. These will be the ultimate cans. Unfortunately the description on the graph site isn't detailed enough for me personally to truly understand so now we are here.\n\nI feel like the ft1's sound is very relaxing. The bass is phenomenal and very deep and visceral. The vocals are smooth. Treble is good for long term listening I'll say. But I feel like I can get a bit more excitement from these headphones. I listen to a lot of rap, a lot of female vocalist from all genres, house, dance, alternative. So bass is a common thing amongst all these genres. Boom, I added a bit more sub bass to give me some extra feelings. I've heard the sennheiser having amazing mids and since the ft1's are mildly v shaped, I raised the mids a tad bit. So I kinda eq'ed my graph to reflect the HDB 630 lower and upper mids and kept the rest the same. It's for sure, much more engaging vocally. I never realized how laid back vocals were. I will try the 6XX mids and see if I like it more. I know drivers play a big part in how sound truly is portrayed. But It made a good enough difference.\n\nNow I'm curious on some things I've noticed. What is the peak in the ft1's line around 1.8K. What is this specific frequency range responsible for. I also noticed the ft1's has a lot less treble in the 6-7K range than most cans. I felt like treble is the feeling I felt on my bones in the front of my face. I did notice raising this area was responsible for this feeling, that's maybe why these aren't as fatiguing to listen to long term. I'm a bit sensitive to treble but even the s12 planars I eq'ed like -2db from 6-7.5K and it was perfect. So I can for sure bump this area up a bit. It's interesting because my friend can use the dt 770's at high volume no issues. I could never lol. Those are some bright cans. I used to have em a long time ago that's why I have em on the graph for comparison.\n\nMy last question is eq'ing 8K or higher worth it and what immediate effects would I notice bumping this region?\n\nThanks for feedback, genuinely I'm such an immersive listener. I like to feel my music truly. If anyone here is a fan on the album Kiss Land by the weeknd. Arguably the most immersive album I ever heard. I'm very big on concept and immersion! even for video games.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 - Maybe Buy 2 Headphones Instead",
    "selftext": "**TLDR:** Good sound, good customization, bad comfort, finnicky connectivity, high price. Audeze Maxwell + Momentum 4 for $50 more (can be less if you're cool with open box) do more things better.\n\n**The positives:**\n\n* **One of the best ever sounding closed backs**, definitely the best I've heard with ANC (vs Bathys, XM5/XM6, Momentum 4, QC Ultra, Airpods Max), competes with or beats many wired closed backs. I think they fall just short of Audeze Maxwell with some EQ adjustments, but those headphones are very close to my tastes out of the box so YMMV.\n* Pairs great tuning with anatomy measurements to normalize low end performance between different users and re-seating.\n* **PEQ** to dial in to your tastes\n* **Low latency** (matched my monitor's input lag near identically in gaming mode by my perception))and high res Bluetooth connections with the dongle. I think Sennheiser are getting close to or even beating that 30ms latency in the low latency dongle mode\n* **The sound with the dongle is excellent**, even in the low latency mode\n* Solid all around functionality as a portable ANC headphone\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n* **Comfort is not great**. Fairly shallow pads that compress easily cause heat and pressure on the pinna, and I don't have big ears. They (and Momentum 4) also have an odd cup angle that requires you to rotate the headband forward which is sub-optimal. For comparison, I find the Bathys comfier in the pads but slightly less comfy in the headband. I hate the XM5/XM6 comfort-wise, 630 are an improvement. APM are comfier and QC Ultra are much much comfier.\n* The WC Freeze pads for Momentum 4 fit and are way comfier but hurt the seal a lot (which makes ANC and sound both much worse) making those pads a complete no-go IMO.\n* No 2.4GHz on the dongle\n* Finicky pairing and touch controls. Same issues as Momentum 4.\n* **No ability to use the mic + get full sound quality at the same time**\n* No options for a boom mic\n* **Boring looking and no color options,** and they are a bit too thick in the cups to look normal vs other ANC.\n* **Expensive**: **You can get a pair of Momentum 4 + an Audeze Maxwell for $50 more**, and less than the price of the HDB 630 if you are willing to do refurbs/open box. Maxwell is comfier to me (weight doesn't bother me, capra strap improves even more) and sounds better + has the boom mic and low latency via 2.4ghz. Momentum 4 sounds pretty good with the built in graphic EQ and not that much worse than HDB 630 if you use another app for PEQ.\n\n**Deeper Sound Breakdown**: These headphones were very quickly determined to be not worth the money for me, so these impressions are not my most thorough. As with all sound impressions, YMMV.\n\n* **Tuning**\n   * They are **a bit mid-bass focused** for me, sounding a bit bloated in the low end. Luckily the blending into the mids is very clean and not boomy. The extension is good, but the midbass focus also reduces how apparent this is\n   * **The mids are very nice.** Perhaps a bit lacking in energy, but this can be fixed with a peak filter most likely somewhere between 1-3k. I often find 2-2.5k helps with this a lot.\n   * **They are very natural sounding in timbre**. This is the one thing that they solidly beat the Momentum 4 at even with the M4 dialed in with the in-app EQ.\n   * **The treble very even and pleasant albeit** maybe a tad too relaxed for me.\n* **Technicalities**\n   * **Bass texture is lacking.** Even with a filter reigning in the midbass, they lacked the grit and texture in the low-end that I really look for in a headphone\n   * **Treble is a bit oversmoothed, leading to a perceived lack of resolution**. This may actually be affecting the bass texture situation.\n   * **They aren't that punchy or energetic**. The midbass focus and a bit of relaxed 1-3k lead to a bit of dullness. Kick drums don't impact as nicely as I'd like, and higher voices don't come through as strongly as I think they should.\n   * **They are a well-controlled but not super 'fast'.** Especially with the bass reduced, they do give the impression of not being sloppy or slow, but they aren't super quick in terms of attack or decay.\n   * **A note about imaging/soundstage**: I am a speaker guy first and foremost. I don't get any impression of verticality or layering from any headphones unless the music is mastered specifically with headphones and spaciousness in mind. I find that production to be very rare. The things I do notice are imaging and distance. **The imaging is good; t**his is mostly just down to consistent channel matching across the FR. **Spaciousness is exactly what you'd expect.** They aren't completely inside my head, but they give no impression the sound is coming from a distance outside of the headphone. This is typical for me for closed backs.\n* **EQ Suggestions:**\n   * Peak filter around 120hz, q\\~1, -1-3db to get rid of the bass bloat\n   * If you are more of a bass roll-off fan, do a bass shelf with 2-5db reduction.\n   * Find the area between 1-3k that increasing with a q filter of \\~1 by 1-3db gives you more energy and punch.\n   * Find any over-emphasis in the low treble, 3-7k and reduce that if needed.\n   * See if you have any aggressive peaks above 5k, and reduce them with smaller q value filters\n   * Add a treble shelf to boost detail if needed.\n\n**Summary:** excellent sound especially with PEQ, mediocre comfort, boring design that looks a bit bulky on head, good latency and sound via dongle, no boom mic, sound is bad when using mic, and pricey vs a dedicated ANC + dedicated gaming headphone. I like the Maxwell + Momentum 4 enough to make it a no-go for me. **But if the mic situation and comfort are good for you, they're very hard to beat as an all-around single solution.**",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Quick Impressions",
    "selftext": "Just got these in and wow — out of the box they sound superb. The tuning is really neutral and everything comes together seamlessly. The bass has great extension and presence — it adds solid weight and heft to the music without bleeding into the mids or muddying up vocals. Speaking of vocals, they’re insanely clear, super natural, and have that spot-on timbre Sennheiser does so well. Instruments sound very lifelike with great clarity and separation too.\n\nTreble is crisp and airy but never harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is actually excellent for a closed-back set, and imaging is really precise. Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other — everything has its space.\n\nHaven’t played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it’s nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony’s level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it’s impressive how well the ANC works — definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn’t.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn’t quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it’s not far behind — way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts — 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I’d still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I’m really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic — clean, balanced, natural — and they’re super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic — super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality’s surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

    "selftext": "Listening to them as I write this. Technically a fist impression but like I know what I'm listening for and done all my test songs so I feel confident on how I feel. They sound great, shocker right. The big thing is music just sounds correct in these. Good bass extension so still fun. Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

    "selftext": "Hey there,\n\njust want to share some of my feelings and likings about my current Hifi-Desktop-Setup which is build of\n\n1. Eversolo DAP-A6 Gen 2 Streamer  \n2. Burson Conductor Voyager Max DAC/AMP  \n3. ModHouse Tungsten DS V1\n\n \n\nI had a lot of headphones before like Mezes Empy II or Elite, DCAs Expanse, ZMFs Atrium and Verite open, Finals D8000 Pro and Hifimans HE1000 Stealth. After all of them I can say after one moth I own the Tungsten, the Tungsten is the clear winner for me.\n\nBase is such punchy and crisp at the same time and goes so crazy deep. Holy smokes. Its also wonderful layered.\n\nMids are present but not so much in your face as Finals D8000 Pro. Its more like the HE1000 Stealth.\n\nTreble is smooth and not fatiguing overall. It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

    "selftext": "Frequency curve taken from [hangout.audio](http://hangout.audio) , I hope St. Crin forgives me.\n\nGot them new for 5€ (shipping included) from a private seller on the electronic bay who got them bundled with their phone but didn't need them. At first, I was slightly afraid they were fakes, but after listening, I am fairly sure they are the real deal.\n\nTheir value is STRONG. The cable is braided below the Y-split. Makes them appear a bit more refined, I guess. These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

    "selftext": "I'm considering getting Ghost of Yotei on PS5 primarily so I can stream it via Chiaki to my Steam Deck (hard to compete for TV time at my house). The only thing I'm not sure about is it seems like GoY requires you to use a lot of the Dualsense specific functionality. That includes pressing down on the touchpad, drawing basic shapes on the touchpad, and using the controller's gyroscope. I know Steam Deck has touchpads and gyroscope, but I've never used them with Chiaki before so not really sure if/how they would work.\n\nIs Chiaki able to emulate the touchpad and gyroscope functions of a Dualsense controller? If so how does it work, is it on the Deck's touchpads or touchscreen or something else? And do these things work out of the box with Chiaki, or does it require some tinkering to set up?",

I have very, very small hands so the grip needs to be improve. \n2. I'm having neck and arms muscle pain so maybe a pillow? \n3. Stick grips. Any recommendations? \n\nBonus: skin for aesthetic without adding volume / weight would be welcome! \n\nBasically I think the deck is still quite heavy and bulk for me. So I'd really like to avoid accessories that might make it heavier or bulkier. \n\nThanks a lot! \n",

    "selftext": "I know it is still far away. But with the new Xbox \"SteamDeck\" released here I a few things I would love the see in an updated SteamDeck.\n\nLet me start by saying that I am not going to talk about advances in the performace of hardware. Those I presume are given and will not really much be in the decision of Valve.\n\n**Hardware features**\n\n* 5G (or perhaps 6G by that point) Modem\n   * While it is quite easy to just take your phone and enable the hotspot feature, it is another link that adds latency.\n   * Just take the SD slot and have it be a SD/SIM card slot or even just use an eSIM. \n   * Even adding basic phone capabilities, like being able to accept a call or text while gaming would be awesome. With most operators now providing the option to clone your SIM, this would be perfect.\n* Fast/er charging + bigger battery.\n   * The 45 W is nice. But being able to quickly charge to 50 % in 20 minutes with a 120 W charger would be awesome. Though it should be said that it would degrade the battery quicker. Maybe something like a quick charge in quick options button that would allow you to activate it could solve this.\n   * Having a larger battery is also good/bad. Added weight might not be something many people want. But I personally do.\n* 2/or more USB ports\n   * 2 USB C ports (one on top and one on the bottom) I believe is something that will get implemented. But now image, if they added a third one! And perhaps even have it be a a USB type A for easier use with things like USB sticks or an older mouse you just have laying around.\n\n**Software features**\n\n* More \"in house\" Apps\n   * Things like a SteamOS Youtube app, Netflix, A videoplayer.\n   * I know these things are fairly easily accesable by adding non-steam games executables. But that is work for a \"normie\" that he doesn't want to do. Just have them included. There could even be a switch between gaming/destop/theater mode. With even more specific controls for media in theater mode.\n   * I think this specifically could transform the SteamDeck from just a portable console to a truly special device. A portable home entertaintment system.",

I have looked a the Dbrand Killswitch and a similar jsaux solution and it is close but not exactly what I am looking for. \n\nI’d rather not have a rubber grip around the console itself.\nI’d like to find a travel cover only that would protect the front of the system -screen and sticks \n\nI know this is neurotic and I am being to particular. However in all of my hype/research of watching tons of YouTube reviews I have the impression there is a cover only solution for the Steam Deck where a top plate can go on top of the system and there is a wrap around band that secures it to the system itself. I could be mistaken but wanted to see if someone is aware of something like this. \n\nUltimately I want to just protect the screen and joysticks, while remaining slim in profile, not adding rubber protectors around the system itself. Thank you to anyone indulging my curiosity and taking the time to read this.",

It was so loud my kids were shaken up. I had to force a shut down to get it to stop. Once it stopped, it powered off but the fan was on max speed. I turned it back on to see if it would function and the fan turned off and it booted fine, but the noises were so loud that the right speaker is blown. \n\nI reached out to steam but of course my deck is out of warranty. \n\nThey suggested I send it in for repair, but I guess I'm a little concerned that it's more than just the blown speaker. Seems odd that it could damage itself in this manner. \n\nThe repair would ~$125 but the DIY kit to repair the speaker is less than half. \n\nAnyone else experience this? Or has anyone performed this repair feel it's worth sending it in? ",

    "selftext": "After a few days of scouring the internet and testing out different things, I finally found settings which im happy with. I will pretty much summarize everything for you all and give the solutions to these problems here [Fletchling of death, random crashes every 15 minutes, cant leave the lab],  stable 60fps (sometimes there are a few dips but lowest ive seen it drop to so far has only been 40 fps in some areas). Do note that these numbers are with lossless scaling(highly recommended) which I find to have completely uplifted the quality for me.\n\nEmulator: Ryubing Canary 1.3.187\n\nFirstly, dont play the game with the dlc and update, I didn't get any luck trying to even start the game with those enabled. I will also not be covering where to get these files or how to setup the emulator and so on.\n\nSettings:\n\nSD Settings:\nLimit clock speed to 1000MHz and TDP of 10W(Up to you really)\n\nRyubing Settings:\nPPTC: on\nCPU Mode: I tried Host unchecked (Fastest, unsafe) and it worked fine for me. If not then just switch to host(fast)\nGraphics: Vulkan \nMultithreading: Auto\nShader Cache: on\nMacro HLE: on\nResolution: Native\nScaling filter: Bilinear\n\n\nLossless scaling:\n\n2x\nBetween 50-60% Flow Scale, lower = less quality but more fps. Try see what works best to you, I set mine to 50.\nPresent Mode FIFO VSync On\nPerformance Mode On\n\nProblems:\n\nThis is probably what most of you are reading this for so this is what worked out for me.\n\n1. Fletchling of Death\n\nYou'll have to transfer your save file from Ryujinx to Eden, then back to Ryujinx. On Ryujinx, save your game just before the cutscene then transfer it to Eden. Once you're on Eden, just go through the cutscene and save after you're done, then transfer back to Ryujinx. Hint: you only need to transfer the 'main' file.\n\n2. Game crashing every 10 minutes\n\n What worked for me was switching from the stable build of ryubing to ryubing canary and the game ran smoother\n\n3. Cant leave Lab\n\nAfter digging around, some people mentioned that this is due to corrupt files in the ROM. For me, I verified the integrity of my ROM on Eden and it said that it was corrupted. I downloaded a different file, replaced the old one and verified again and it was successful. After that I just boot up ryujinx and was able to go through the cutscene without problems. This may also be the root cause of the problem for the Fletchling of Death, just a hypothesis though, i didn't test it.\n\nMods:\n\nYou can search for a whole folder of mods for the game, just search for Switch-Ultrawide -Mods Github and you'll find it. I did not go through every single mod, I just enabled these and found they looked good to me and the game was still stable so I just ran with it. Not sure bout the others though.\n\n1. Improved FOV\n2. Reduce Bloom\n3. Disable DOF\n\nI am by no means a professional at this, quite the opposite really, tried everything that people recommended online so im just sharing my experience because I almost gave up on trying to emulate this game lol. Do note that im not that far into the game yet so there may be more problems that I'll run into.\n\nHappy gaming, hope this helped :)\n\nEdit: Formatting\n",

I just submitted a claim for a cracked screen and it was denied. Reason stated that the Steam Deck is not covered by Home Plus.\n\nI wanted to give people a heads up on their service and products.\n\n\nUPDATE: Hello everyone, I wanted to give an update. Shoutout to u/Asurion_Alex for helping me get in contact with Asurion. A supervisor got in contact with me and helped me re-file a claim and it got accepted.\nWhat had happened was, I first submitted a claim through the mobile app, but because something was missing or i didnt answer correctly it was rejected. I then called the same day to refile a claim over the phone. I answered all the questions and provided all need info but it was rejected a 2nd time. I posted here and at r/Asurion, and u/Asurion_Alex gave me a POC to reach out to. A supervisor reached out to me within a few hours. It was explained to me that when the first claim was rejected, and I resubmitted a 2nd claim, the first one did not clear quickly enough and thus the 2nd claim was rejected due to the first claim, or at least that was close to what was explained to me. \n\nI wanted to thank everyone for their responses and feedback. It great to see when a community comes together to support fellow Redditors.\n\nAdditional Info: I have had this plan for over a year, so I was past the initial 31 days. Some people may disagree with warranties/insurance programs, and it is true I have had some both good and bad experiences. But overall this is a success, there is no indication that my premium will go up. So at the end of the day this is a win.",

I am surprised to say that it is playable, though has some major caveats. It will stick to 30 FPS most of the time, but can regularly drop quickly to 28 FPS, with some bigger drops and stutters when entering and leaving buildings and towns.\n\nI also tested Lossless Scaling, which works to some degree, with some parts of the game feeling very smooth with no input lag using 2X, but go into cities and we have some big slowdowns that just feel awful. I personally don't recommend using it, but it does work to some degree, so I can understand the reasoning to try it out.\n\nYou can check out more details in our written or video impressions about performance!\n\n[Written](https://steamdeckhq.com/news/the-outer-worlds-2-is-just-barely-playable-on-the-steam-deck-first-impressions/)\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9czTJtLflpI)",

    "selftext": "I'm considering getting Ghost of Yotei on PS5 primarily so I can stream it via Chiaki to my Steam Deck (hard to compete for TV time at my house). The only thing I'm not sure about is it seems like GoY requires you to use a lot of the Dualsense specific functionality. That includes pressing down on the touchpad, drawing basic shapes on the touchpad, and using the controller's gyroscope. I know Steam Deck has touchpads and gyroscope, but I've never used them with Chiaki before so not really sure if/how they would work.\n\nIs Chiaki able to emulate the touchpad and gyroscope functions of a Dualsense controller? If so how does it work, is it on the Deck's touchpads or touchscreen or something else? And do these things work out of the box with Chiaki, or does it require some tinkering to set up?",

I have tried every single reddit post, spoke to Chat GBT to a level that we developed a special relation ship, and I still could not find a solution. It keeps doing the launch sign, goes into Steam logo loading, then goes back to Green Play button as if nothing happened\n\n  \nBelow are the solutions I tried:\n\n1) Changed proton versions (I tried all of Proton 8 until 10). When I tried proton 5, the anti cheat screen was able to pop up (but it goes back to the green play button)\n\n2) Disabled Decky\n\n3) Tried the launch option commands\n\n4) deleted compact data and shaders\n\n5) disabled wifi\n\n  \nI really would love if someone can help me. thanks a lot in advance!",

I tried every combination of buttons I could find online, every troubleshooting guide, and nothing worked. So I opened the Steam Deck to find... the picture attached! Comparing it to replacement batteries online, this is really quite swollen. I got the advice to discharge it, of course, since lithium batteries explode, but I cannot do that because the Steam Deck won't turn on. So I wanted to ask two things:\n1) How the Hell do I remove this battery? I can't apply heat to it because it's fully charged, so the glue that's under the battery won't come undone.\n2) Is the problem likely to be the battery? I would like to know if all I need is a replacement battery or if my console's life I'd well and truly over.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I turned it back on to see if it would function and the fan turned off and it booted fine, but the noises were so loud that the right speaker is blown. \n\nI reached out to steam but of course my deck is out of warranty. \n\nThey suggested I send it in for repair, but I guess I'm a little concerned that it's more than just the blown speaker. Seems odd that it could damage itself in this manner. \n\nThe repair would ~$125 but the DIY kit to repair the speaker is less than half. \n\nAnyone else experience this?

I just submitted a claim for a cracked screen and it was denied. Reason stated that the Steam Deck is not covered by Home Plus.\n\nI wanted to give people a heads up on their service and products.\n\n\nUPDATE: Hello everyone, I wanted to give an update. Shoutout to u/Asurion_Alex for helping me get in contact with Asurion. A supervisor got in contact with me and helped me re-file a claim and it got accepted.\nWhat had happened was, I first submitted a claim through the mobile app, but because something was missing or i didnt answer correctly it was rejected. I then called the same day to refile a claim over the phone. I answered all the questions and provided all need info but it was rejected a 2nd time. I posted here and at r/Asurion, and u/Asurion_Alex gave me a POC to reach out to. A supervisor reached out to me within a few hours. It was explained to me that when the first claim was rejected, and I resubmitted a 2nd claim, the first one did not clear quickly enough and thus the 2nd claim was rejected due to the first claim, or at least that was close to what was explained to me. \n\nI wanted to thank everyone for their responses and feedback. It great to see when a community comes together to support fellow Redditors.\n\nAdditional Info: I have had this plan for over a year, so I was past the initial 31 days. Some people may disagree with warranties/insurance programs, and it is true I have had some both good and bad experiences. But overall this is a success, there is no indication that my premium will go up. So at the end of the day this is a win.",

Or is it going to tank like crazy after this bit?\n\n***UPDATE: Got out into first route and could not hit 30fps for me on low settings. Was high 20s. So still a bit of a bunk it seems. Shame as was excited to play handheld.\n\nNot tried running under DirectX 11 tho. \n\n***UPDATE 2: Directx 11 is way worse. 15fps LOL. ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! With The Outer Worlds 2 releasing soon, we got a chance to check it out ahead of its launch and test it on the Steam Deck. I am surprised to say that it is playable, though has some major caveats. It will stick to 30 FPS most of the time, but can regularly drop quickly to 28 FPS, with some bigger drops and stutters when entering and leaving buildings and towns.\n\nI also tested Lossless Scaling, which works to some degree, with some parts of the game feeling very smooth with no input lag using 2X, but go into cities and we have some big slowdowns that just feel awful. I personally don't recommend using it, but it does work to some degree, so I can understand the reasoning to try it out.\n\nYou can check out more details in our written or video impressions about performance!\n\n[Written](https://steamdeckhq.com/news/the-outer-worlds-2-is-just-barely-playable-on-the-steam-deck-first-impressions/)\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9czTJtLflpI)",

I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

    "title": "Reverse-engineering DPS 101 on LEDVANCE Tuya RGBIC lamp - unknown LED indices cause device reboot",
    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

Ordering from abroad would take months and be quite expensive.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about using four regular digital pressure gauges instead. My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

Cars pull into the wrong driveway, random animals wander near the fence line, and sometimes packages get left at weird spots around the yard. Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar?

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

Props to them for doing the right thing. They not only created a solid product but they also made sure that the end user would be able to use the product without having to buy another battery from zooz. \n\nI know it’s stupid but this has made a loyal customer out of me and I deeply respect this company. \n",

I can get them to all come back if I powercycle all of my Echos at the same time, but they start dropping off again within an hour.\n\nI'm at a dead-end as far as troubleshooting.  I have tried powercycling, reconfiguring, connecting things in a different order, etc.  I have factory reset everything in the entire system multiple times.  As I previously mentioned, all firmware is up to date.  If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'd be tearing my hair out if I had any left.  Thank you in advance.",

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

    "title": "Reverse-engineering DPS 101 on LEDVANCE Tuya RGBIC lamp - unknown LED indices cause device reboot",
    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar?

I can get them to all come back if I powercycle all of my Echos at the same time, but they start dropping off again within an hour.\n\nI'm at a dead-end as far as troubleshooting.  I have tried powercycling, reconfiguring, connecting things in a different order, etc.  I have factory reset everything in the entire system multiple times.  As I previously mentioned, all firmware is up to date.  If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

Sure enough, I was prompted to login and it logged in successfully this time, and my device was listed. Hit the power button via the app and sure enough it went off.\n\nWent into SmartThings linked services and reconnected it successfully to the Sengled cloud. Device is now controllable again in Smartthings.\n\nI know most (if not all) people that have Sengled devices have moved on to non-cloud dependent devices, but figured anyone that still has a Sengled device and has been using the manual control button since their cloud service went offline, might want to know that it's back up again. Guess we'll see how long it lasts this time.\n\n  \nEdit: 10/20/2025 was when traffic started logging in my firewall again for the Sengled device.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

(Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

I currently have it on a smart outlet thats on/off on a schedule. I would like to find a smart outlet that will dim on/off the lights over the course of anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes. I dont really care what the time increment is. I just wanna be able to set it to dim on at x time and dim off at x time. I have cruised youtube and the google and have not found what I'm lookin for yet, i dont think. So i figured id come to the ole reddit and see if what I'm looking for even exists and if anyone has specific products they would suggest. ",

    "title": "Bosch Air 2000i WiFi question",
    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

AC doesnt support a wifi function so it won't work with the TCL home app. The Smart IR blaster is an OEM tuya remote. \n\nI first tried to consult this to an AI model but it said that remotes often transmit a long code containing temperature, modes and whatnot and that the IR receiver of the blaster might not be picking that long code and only picking up a quick bit of it.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nAfter years of saying I’d never get into the whole smarthome thing (“I can just get off the couch and turn on the lights myself”), I’ve finally caved.  \nUp until now, my only smart device was my robot vacuum — *Consuela* — but it’s time for something new.\n\nI want to build a **wake-up light** setup in my bedroom that can also double as extra lighting during the darker winter months.\n\n**The plan:**  \nI’m thinking of installing a **4–5 meter LED strip** between the edge of my dropped ceiling and my curtains, using an L-profile so the light shines down and bounces softly off the curtains. Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I’ve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I’m wondering if there’s a better alternative.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4–5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you’ve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn’t a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance — and if you’ve built something like this, I’d love to see your setup!",

Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup?

(Some things are more comokicated but with enough time i can handle it) So i would love to have the visualisation over HA. \n\nBUT; What would be the best/easiest way to set up the rest/electricity? This should be more of an easy/straight forward thing. Should run when we move into the house. I can set the HA things later. \n\nI Thought KNX would be the way, but there are still a few disadvantages:\n\n- I cant program ETS by myself\n- I would like to have the main functions to work with KNX (heating, shading, lights, main door lock, garage door) to be controled over switches AND something like a Shelly walldisplay which should have all functions.\n\nSo my questions is:\n-Is it possible to control shading, main door lock etc. also over HA? (Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

I’ve looked into Anviz. The P7 is still available locally but seems to be EOL, and the C2 Slim appears to be out of stock everywhere.\n\nDoes anyone have other suggestions or recommendations for specific models?\n\nThanks!",

Sure enough, I was prompted to login and it logged in successfully this time, and my device was listed. Hit the power button via the app and sure enough it went off.\n\nWent into SmartThings linked services and reconnected it successfully to the Sengled cloud. Device is now controllable again in Smartthings.\n\nI know most (if not all) people that have Sengled devices have moved on to non-cloud dependent devices, but figured anyone that still has a Sengled device and has been using the manual control button since their cloud service went offline, might want to know that it's back up again. Guess we'll see how long it lasts this time.\n\n  \nEdit: 10/20/2025 was when traffic started logging in my firewall again for the Sengled device.",

Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I’ve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I’m wondering if there’s a better alternative.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4–5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you’ve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn’t a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance — and if you’ve built something like this, I’d love to see your setup!",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I'm starting to feel the chill in my home so I'm looking for advice on upgrading to a smart heating system and would love input from anyone with experience.\n\n**My setup:**\n\n* Worcester Bosch 8000 boiler\n* Two Danfoss TP5000si thermostats (one upstairs in the unused spare bedroom, one downstairs)\n* Radiators with a mix of numbered TRVs and some without\n* Located in the UK\n* I work from home alone some days, and other days the house is empty\n\n**Goals:**\n\n* Avoid heating unused rooms (e.g. spare bedroom upstairs)\n* Maintain comfort in rooms I use (like my home office)\n* Save energy and money\n* Ideally control everything remotely or via schedule/geofencing\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

The audio interface is also plugged into an outlet. I have tried the following:\n\n1. Installed On-board Intel chipset and Realtek Audio Drivers from MSI Z790 MEG Ace MOBO page\n2. Checked Windows hasn't reduced volume in \"Communications\" tab of Sound Settings\n3. Checked NVIDIA Control Panel hasn't reduced volume in \"Communications\" tab of Sound Settings\n4. Installed drivers for Behringer UMC404HD\n5. All volume dials are for all applications are set to max in Windows sound settings\n6. I have not changed any settings/adjusted any dials on the speakers or audio interface\n\nI'm sure it's just a simple problem such as a Windows setting or missing driver, just not sure what to do from here.\n\nAppreciate any assistance.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, so ever since around two weeks ago my internet on my computer has just randomly slowed down? I've tried to come up with fixes like moving my computer a tad bit in my room. I currently have my computer upstairs in my room, my router is located downstairs and I'm unable to move my computer downstairs or even move my router. I've (temporarily) fixed this issue in the past with a wifi usb adapter (specifically the tp-link ax1800), and that sped up my internet by a lot for around 10 months, but now it's just suddenly slowed down, even the usb adapter is having trouble and it constantly says no internet. \n\nI'd like to add that my room does receive the worst wifi connection in my house (yes I've looked at wifi repeaters but I'm not too sure how reliable those are since people complain about the latency?) \n\nOne last thing, my router can directly tell me my internet speeds with a display and the upload speed is around 1700Mbps and my download is around 1000Mbps.\n\nIf you guys need anymore information I'd be glad to provide, help would be much appreciated, thanks!",

The wifi works perfectly with my wife's computer, our phones, the Roku, etc, but as soon as I connect my notebook, everything crashes and becomes unusable.\n\nI have read it might be an IP address conflict, but I can't figure out how to fix it.

When that happens, I can’t reconnect manually; it just keeps showing “Connecting” and then says it can’t connect to the network.\n\nSometimes restarting the TV (either through the menu or by holding the power button) helps, but not always.\nI found online that toggling the “Automatic date & time” setting can help, and it actually does — sometimes it stays stable for months, but then it starts disconnecting again after a few minutes.\n\nI’ve also tried a factory reset, which works temporarily but the issue eventually returns.\nNo difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi, same behavior. Router is close enough to the TV so it's not a range issue.\n\nIf anyone has experienced this or knows a more permanent fix, I’d really appreciate your help — it’s driving me crazy at this point.\n\nThanks in advance!",

We already tried pressing F2 while the computer is still loading and this gives us two possibilities: reformatting the computer (which could possibly delete all the softwares previously installed bc he has never done a backup - so it's better if we avoid this) or reinstalling all windows applications (we tried this, but it leads to an error bc windows applications have already been installed). Pressing the keyboard, once the computer has turned on, leads to nothing, as the computer doesn't get the signal from the USB keyboard. I have no clue why the mouse and the keyboard can be used while the computer is loading, but not once my father gets inside his account. Any help is appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Back in 2020, we purchased about 100 iPads for one reason or another. I think something to do with Telehealth. Most of them were used and rolled out to the world, with no problems. \n\nNow it's late 2025, and we have about 20 iPads that we haven't taken out of the box yet. Of these, I believe so far we've found 6 iPads that refuse to turn on and stay on. \n\nWhen plugged into the stock charger (these are older gen 2 pro iPads, so they came with Apple Chargers), they will show the Apple logo for about 3-5 seconds, before it goes away, seemingly turning off, pausing for another 3-5 seconds, and showing the Apple logo again. Not my video, but it looks like this [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U\\_wjIpfyXE8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U_wjIpfyXE8) but with a white logo on black background and a different model iPad\n\nSince I have so many brokenish iPads, my coworkers and I have been able to try a few things.   \nFirst, I tried overnight charging with the stock charger.   \nI tried overnight with a faster charger, which was a laptop charger.   \nI tried overnight with a slower charger, which is the USB port on my computer. \n\nThen I tried booting into recovery mode (I believe called DFU mode). I do this a lot, I'm familiar with how the process works.   \nWhen trying to use my desktop to do this, it isn't even getting enough power to show the little computer and plug symbols.   \nWhen trying to boot into recovery while plugged into the wall with the stock charger, it will show the symbol and it will stay on (more on that next), but obviously I can't restore the iPad if I'm plugged up to the wall.   \nNext I tried recovery mode from a laptop that has a thunderbolt port, which seems to have more power in the USB port than my desktop. This would briefly flip to showing the computer and plug symbol, before turning itself off and back on to the Apple symbol. \n\nThe laptop also had one of those ports with a battery+ symbol, but it seemed to power the iPad less than the Thunderbolt port.   \nI also had a powered dock, with the same battery+ symbol that behaved the same. \n\nSince the iPad will seemingly stay on for a few minutes when in recovery mode, I also tried leaving it there for a few minutes. Normal iPad behavior turns that off after a few minutes, and this does the same, putting it back in the bootloop. \n\n  \nWe believe the problem is that the iPad is so dead that it can't start the firmware needed to properly initiate charging. A potential solution to this would be a jumpstart, but not only would we not know how to do this, but it could be dangerous. The other solution would be to take the battery out, charge it externally, and put it back together. We have a lot of iPads that are broken, however, and no experience doing this. Assuming it's even possible. ",

    "title": "£6000 Custom-Built High-End PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) Underperforming — Seeking Advice",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice or insight into ongoing performance issues with my custom-built PC. I had it built by a reputable company in **March 2024**, and although I have a decent general understanding of computers, I’m not confident when it comes to deeper technical stuff like tweaking voltages, overclocking, or manually adjusting CPU cores.\n\nI invested around **£6000** into this system with the goal of having a rig that could handle **any modern game at ultra/max settings** and high frame rates — ideally also being **future-proof for 4K gaming** down the line. I had a company build this for me and optimise the system in the hopes that I could just plug it in and play games at ultra settings without issue, but that hasn't been the case. \n\nCurrently, I’m running:\n\n* 3 monitors total (2x 1080p 60Hz + 1x 1440p 144Hz main monitor)\n* Main monitor via DisplayPort, other two via HDMI (one uses a HDMI → DP adapter)\n\n\n\n# Full Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D (Zen 4)\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA ROG STRIX RTX 4090 24GB\n* **RAM:** 4x Kingston FURY DDR5 32GB 5600MHz (currently running 2 sticks at 5200MHz for testing)\n* **Cooler:** Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix XT (360mm AIO)\n* **Case:** HYTE Y60 (Black)\n* **PSU:** Corsair HX1500i (1500W Platinum Modular)\n* **Storage:** WD Black SN850X 4TB NVMe SSD + WD Red Plus 14TB HDD\n* **OS:** Windows 11 Pro\n\n\n\n# Performance Issues:\n\nSince I got it, the system hasn’t been performing anywhere near what I’d expect for this hardware tier (unless I'm being naive). Even with background software and RGB programs closed, **most games struggle to maintain high or consistent FPS**.\n\nFor example, in **Battlefield 6**, with settings mostly on *High*, I get anywhere between **80–140 FPS**, constantly fluctuating with noticeable **frame spikes** and stutters. Although, this tends to be on the lower end, as do most other games. BF6 overlay show the **CPU frametimes spiking much more than GPU**, though GPU performance also seems underwhelming.\n\nOlder or less demanding games (e.g., Rocket League, League of Legends) run fine, but more modern or graphically demanding titles show big frame inconsistencies or low averages (I am getting 50–80 FPS on Ultra in GTA V, which feels way too low for this hardware). I have Rocket League settings all at the lowest for performance, but if I switch on all the settings at max, I still get frame spikes here as well. \n\n\n\n# RAM Notes:\n\nI’ve recently discovered that **running 4 sticks of RAM** can cause stability or performance issues compared to 2 sticks, but I'm not overly sure if this is correct.\n\n* With **4 sticks**, I can only reach **3600MHz stable**.\n* With **2 sticks**, I can run **5200MHz**, but anything higher fails to boot (black screen).\n\nPerformance *feels* slightly more consistent with 2 sticks installed, but FPS is lower. A friend mentioned my RAM might not be on the motherboard’s **QVL list** and that “compatible” RAM doesn’t always mean *optimal*.\n\nWould it be worth buying new RAM entirely, or is that unlikely to be the root cause here?\n\n\n\n# What I’ve Tried:\n\n* Updated **BIOS** and all **drivers** (GPU, chipset, Windows, etc.)\n* Tried both **High Performance** and **Balanced** Windows power plans (apparently 7950X3D prefers Balanced, so I tried changing to this yesterday, but everything still doesn't feel great)\n* Adjusted **NVIDIA Control Panel** and **Windows Graphics settings** to prioritize the 4090 and performance\n* Tested disabling unnecessary background software and lighting control programs, but issues occur despite this.\n* Checked performance on **UserBenchmark**, which consistently reports:\n   * CPU frequency *“very low”*\n   * RAM frequency below rated speeds\n   * System load higher than expected (even when idle)\n* Closed all overlays except **NVIDIA ShadowPlay**, which I’d ideally like to use for clips. However, I've tried turning this off in the past (although this was around a year ago), and I still had issues. I see other people using this all the time and they seem to be fine?\n\nDespite all this, I still see unstable FPS, frame drops, frame spiking and what looks like CPU underutilisation.\n\n\n\n# Questions / Advice Needed:\n\n* Am I **expecting too much** from this system, or should a 7950X3D + RTX 4090 genuinely be able to handle almost any game on ultra at high FPS (especially at 1440p)?\n* Could **RAM compatibility or configuration** be a major cause of these issues?\n* Is it worth learning about and adjusting **CCD/Core Parking or undervolting**, or could that make things worse without deep knowledge?\n* Any other ideas on how to **diagnose and fix** performance inconsistencies and CPU frame spikes?\n\nI just want to be able to play games on high settings with consistent performance and FPS, and I thought this sort of hardware should be able to do that. I've been on/off battling with this for 18 months I’m starting to feel a bit lost and disappointed given the investment, so any expert guidance would be hugely appreciated.\n\n\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* £6000 custom-built PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) underperforming since day one\n* Games fluctuate heavily in FPS, experiencing frame loss/spiking/stuttering, even at low/mid settings\n* CPU frametimes spike often; GPU also underperforms from what I can see\n* 4 sticks of DDR5 only stable at 3600MHz, 2 sticks at 5200MHz — unsure if RAM config or compatibility is hurting performance\n* Tried updating BIOS/drivers/power plans/Windows settings — no real improvement\n* Looking for help figuring out if this is **normal**, **RAM-related**, or a **hardware/software config issue**",

On the cable it says 15w33 like its some kind of wireless charger, but it looks like the top of a cybertruck, and it does have a joint. I can turn it and it can sit in a different way and it just looks like something you put on the desk that says \"asus\" as a decoration. But it can't just be that, because its connected to 3 hookups. (Sorry I have no phone at the moment or camera to show you.) But I'm curious about what it is. Does anyone know? its all matte black no other colors on the thing or the cable.

This buzzing sound also stops if a sound starts.\n\nThe interesting thing is, if a leave a tab on youtube playing a Humming sound on 1% volume (inaudible for me), then the buzzing sound never happens again.\n\nFor grounding issue, i tried connecting a usb-c/usb to a usb port on my laptop and touching the other end, and the buzzing sound happens anyway. Don't know if it was a proper grounding test though. There is no metal part in the case, as it is all plastic.\n\nAlso, the headset works fine, tested it on my phone, xbox, and my other pc.\n\nThe buzzing sound, weirdly enough, only happens one ear at a time, never both. Sometimes it buzz on the left ear, sometimes on the right, and the pitch varies too.",

I deleted the app and right after I deleted it, a new app called \"Water Puzzle Sort\" was installed. I then installed \"PCAPdroid\", an app that let's me view all the traffic coming in and out of the phone. I saw traffic from an app called \"Mobile Services Manager\" sending requests to urls with download in their domain name. I promptly disabled this app. It's important to note that the two applications I saw install by themselves were both published by \"guru puzzle games\". Im nervous that I somehow have persistent malware that can stay on a phone, even after factory reset. \n\nI have attached a screenshot of the traffic I captured. The github requests are related to pcapdroid and the urls that say \"download-att\" are requests made my \"Mobile Services Manager\". \n\nPlease shed some light on this matter.

And the GPU (3070Ti Laptop) doesn’t show, and shows only the (wrong) TDP. \nAlarmed, I go to the bios to verify and indeed the bios from another laptop (G513RM) was installed. \n\nI’m relatively tech savvy, so i wanted to ask if i could pick up the correct bios from the ASUS website, now that the bios is unlocked, and flash the correct file myself?\n\nthanks again.

    "title": "My PC gets unresponsive ( Ctlr+Alt+Del helps for a while)",
    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nRecently I've came back from holiday and it seems for some odd reason my PC gets unresponsive every time it turns it on. Previously I had no issue whatsoever. I made few tests but it seems I've lost any further ideas what to do, so here are all potential useful information's what I've discovered:\n\n**In summary:**\n\n1. My PC gets partialy unresponsive:\n\nSo in this situation I can see that once my PC turns on I can still move the mouse, it highlights the icons and everything which shows that the PC works. I can left click on my desktop however I cannot select anything. The start taskbar does not work. I've believed this could have been the mouse issue as the keyboard fully works but it happens with other mouses too. What I mean is even though I cannot click anything if I press anything on my keyboard it all works. The windows taskbar does work if I press for instance Windows key. I have ended up using more key shortcuts along with tab button but that's not an answer to it.\n\nUpdate: While I posting this my whole windows is unresponsive again but I can still write here normally and if necessary I'm able to select a spelling corrections from dropdown.  Not sure if this is also important but I can see that while I write this post whenever there is my mouse cursor on this writing, it goes back to this part of writing as if I've clicked it that I want to write from there.\n\n2. Google Chrome:\n\nI can see this also often happens with google chrome but with other browsers. So if I use few tabs (like 1-4) after a minute the google chrome becomes unresponsive on clicking the tabs. I do have number of bookmarks on my tab and instead of the switching on to them, it sets them to another tab automatically. However it does not allow me to select any tabs.\n\n  \nAlso this is my assumption but I believe that the responsiveness happens often at the start of my pc and while my PC is on for a while it happens less often...but still happens. But I might be wrong.\n\n  \nNot sure if this is an important information too but I've been on Windows 11 Pro for some good few years. For number of months I haven't received any new windows updates as I had an information 'Get the newer version of Windows to stay up to date'. However recently I had an notification that I can update to version 23H2. I don't want to say it wrong if I didn't had those issues before this update. I haven't paid attention much back then. \n\n**I did number of things to try to fix this:**\n\n\\-Updated all potential drivers for system and other programs including graphic card. It seems I'm all up to date\n\n\\- I've tried to defrag my PC\n\n\\-I've tried to update my CPU from official intel website but they do tell me that I'm all up to date.\n\n\\-I've opened my PC case to see if there is any dust but it seems it's all good. During my gameplay I do have my GPU temp around 65-75c.\n\n\\-I do use wallpaper engine which I thought this could be the issue as once I've closed it down fully my PC was working but for small amount of time\n\n\\-CTRL + ALT + DEL = This is currently my only solution for my PC to be responsive again...however this is once again for small amount of time as the issue comes back. \n\n\n\n**Overall:**  \nI started to pay attention to this since yesterday as it became annoying for me. One thing I did notice that this doesn't affect me while I play any games or at least I wasn't affected yet (especially FPS games which require lot's of mouse to work around). But one thing I've tested is that if I play some FPS game and then I go back to click something  desktop (as I play in full screen window mode) it does become unresponsive sometimes (and once again I have to process C+A+D to fix this. So I do assume this is something my CPU or internal graphical card which is used for desktop? Perhaps there is something wrong in settings? While I write this now my PC uses 8-12% of CPU. I do plan to make a hard reset of my system at some point but firstly I wanted to ask your opinion what could be the issue and if I can fix it now other way around. \n\n  \nHere are my specs:\n\nWindows 11 Pro\n\nIntel Core i5-8600k\n\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GTX\n\nMb: Asus tuf B360-Plus Gaming\n\n24B DDR4 SDRAM\n\n\n\n",

You cannot open anything from the taskbar, you can't see it, you can see it in safe mode but not has no functionality at all. We have tried a variety of scripts, GPO settings, No GPO settings, varies user accounts but are unable to get the taskbar to reappear. We have checked system logs and nothing seems to show and issue. We have tried to update from 24h2 to 25h2 but this also does not resolve the issue.\n\nWe have to actually reimage machines with a 24h2 Windows 11 build to get the taskbar to reappear.

Already contacted the seller but might as well just ask here while I wait for a response.\n\nSome details:\n\n\\- Windows disk manager sees the drive, but has it labeled as unknown.

    "title": "5 year old unopened iPads won't charge. Is there any reasonable hope?",
    "selftext": "Back in 2020, we purchased about 100 iPads for one reason or another. I think something to do with Telehealth. Most of them were used and rolled out to the world, with no problems. \n\nNow it's late 2025, and we have about 20 iPads that we haven't taken out of the box yet. Of these, I believe so far we've found 6 iPads that refuse to turn on and stay on. \n\nWhen plugged into the stock charger (these are older gen 2 pro iPads, so they came with Apple Chargers), they will show the Apple logo for about 3-5 seconds, before it goes away, seemingly turning off, pausing for another 3-5 seconds, and showing the Apple logo again. Not my video, but it looks like this [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U\\_wjIpfyXE8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U_wjIpfyXE8) but with a white logo on black background and a different model iPad\n\nSince I have so many brokenish iPads, my coworkers and I have been able to try a few things.   \nFirst, I tried overnight charging with the stock charger.   \nI tried overnight with a faster charger, which was a laptop charger.   \nI tried overnight with a slower charger, which is the USB port on my computer. \n\nThen I tried booting into recovery mode (I believe called DFU mode). I do this a lot, I'm familiar with how the process works.   \nWhen trying to use my desktop to do this, it isn't even getting enough power to show the little computer and plug symbols.   \nWhen trying to boot into recovery while plugged into the wall with the stock charger, it will show the symbol and it will stay on (more on that next), but obviously I can't restore the iPad if I'm plugged up to the wall.   \nNext I tried recovery mode from a laptop that has a thunderbolt port, which seems to have more power in the USB port than my desktop. This would briefly flip to showing the computer and plug symbol, before turning itself off and back on to the Apple symbol. \n\nThe laptop also had one of those ports with a battery+ symbol, but it seemed to power the iPad less than the Thunderbolt port.   \nI also had a powered dock, with the same battery+ symbol that behaved the same. \n\nSince the iPad will seemingly stay on for a few minutes when in recovery mode, I also tried leaving it there for a few minutes. Normal iPad behavior turns that off after a few minutes, and this does the same, putting it back in the bootloop. \n\n  \nWe believe the problem is that the iPad is so dead that it can't start the firmware needed to properly initiate charging. A potential solution to this would be a jumpstart, but not only would we not know how to do this, but it could be dangerous. The other solution would be to take the battery out, charge it externally, and put it back together. We have a lot of iPads that are broken, however, and no experience doing this. Assuming it's even possible. ",

    "selftext": "Hi guys, so yesterday my father disinstalled a bunch of applications from his computer (an all-in-one Lenovo model) and today all of his USB ports are not working. So we can't use the mouse, the keyboard or anything. Is there any chance we could fix this mess? We already tried pressing F2 while the computer is still loading and this gives us two possibilities: reformatting the computer (which could possibly delete all the softwares previously installed bc he has never done a backup - so it's better if we avoid this) or reinstalling all windows applications (we tried this, but it leads to an error bc windows applications have already been installed). Pressing the keyboard, once the computer has turned on, leads to nothing, as the computer doesn't get the signal from the USB keyboard. I have no clue why the mouse and the keyboard can be used while the computer is loading, but not once my father gets inside his account. Any help is appreciated.",

Its so bad that i get timed out of my own router's website (if i enter the gateway ip, no issues, if i use url, timeout).\n\nFirst, I tried to single out if the issue is on my side or my isp. So I got an Ethernet to usb c adapter and tested on my laptop. That is, from the apartment directly to the laptop. I had no issues here. Everything worked as it should. But, as soon as i plug the cable back to the WAN port, back to square 1.\n\nI have tried changing the router just in case, but that didnt resolve it. And I am currently out of ideas. I have no idea what to do now. \n\nSome commands i ran on PowerShell:\nWhile its plugged into the router:\n\nNslookup www.google.com 1.1.1.1 (or 8.8.8.8) resulted in timeout multiple times.\nTest-NetConnection 1.1.1.1 (or 8.8.8.8) -Port 53 resulted in tcptestsucceeded = false\n\nThe commands above resulted in success when directly connected to my laptop though. \n\nAnyone who has any pointers?

    "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI just have a small but annoying problem regarding audio output on the PC. I've noticed that since my PC was reset, the speakers and headphones are much quieter than before. To explain the setup, I have a pair of Yamaha HS8 Studio Monitors and DT770 Pro headphones plugged into the UMC404HD (audio interface) which is connected by USB to the PC. The audio interface is also plugged into an outlet. I have tried the following:\n\n1. Installed On-board Intel chipset and Realtek Audio Drivers from MSI Z790 MEG Ace MOBO page\n2. Checked Windows hasn't reduced volume in \"Communications\" tab of Sound Settings\n3. Checked NVIDIA Control Panel hasn't reduced volume in \"Communications\" tab of Sound Settings\n4. Installed drivers for Behringer UMC404HD\n5. All volume dials are for all applications are set to max in Windows sound settings\n6. I have not changed any settings/adjusted any dials on the speakers or audio interface\n\nI'm sure it's just a simple problem such as a Windows setting or missing driver, just not sure what to do from here.\n\nAppreciate any assistance.",

When that happens, I can’t reconnect manually; it just keeps showing “Connecting” and then says it can’t connect to the network.\n\nSometimes restarting the TV (either through the menu or by holding the power button) helps, but not always.\nI found online that toggling the “Automatic date & time” setting can help, and it actually does — sometimes it stays stable for months, but then it starts disconnecting again after a few minutes.\n\nI’ve also tried a factory reset, which works temporarily but the issue eventually returns.\nNo difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi, same behavior. Router is close enough to the TV so it's not a range issue.\n\nIf anyone has experienced this or knows a more permanent fix, I’d really appreciate your help — it’s driving me crazy at this point.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Back in 2020, we purchased about 100 iPads for one reason or another. I think something to do with Telehealth. Most of them were used and rolled out to the world, with no problems. \n\nNow it's late 2025, and we have about 20 iPads that we haven't taken out of the box yet. Of these, I believe so far we've found 6 iPads that refuse to turn on and stay on. \n\nWhen plugged into the stock charger (these are older gen 2 pro iPads, so they came with Apple Chargers), they will show the Apple logo for about 3-5 seconds, before it goes away, seemingly turning off, pausing for another 3-5 seconds, and showing the Apple logo again. Not my video, but it looks like this [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U\\_wjIpfyXE8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U_wjIpfyXE8) but with a white logo on black background and a different model iPad\n\nSince I have so many brokenish iPads, my coworkers and I have been able to try a few things.   \nFirst, I tried overnight charging with the stock charger.   \nI tried overnight with a faster charger, which was a laptop charger.   \nI tried overnight with a slower charger, which is the USB port on my computer. \n\nThen I tried booting into recovery mode (I believe called DFU mode). I do this a lot, I'm familiar with how the process works.   \nWhen trying to use my desktop to do this, it isn't even getting enough power to show the little computer and plug symbols.   \nWhen trying to boot into recovery while plugged into the wall with the stock charger, it will show the symbol and it will stay on (more on that next), but obviously I can't restore the iPad if I'm plugged up to the wall.   \nNext I tried recovery mode from a laptop that has a thunderbolt port, which seems to have more power in the USB port than my desktop. This would briefly flip to showing the computer and plug symbol, before turning itself off and back on to the Apple symbol. \n\nThe laptop also had one of those ports with a battery+ symbol, but it seemed to power the iPad less than the Thunderbolt port.   \nI also had a powered dock, with the same battery+ symbol that behaved the same. \n\nSince the iPad will seemingly stay on for a few minutes when in recovery mode, I also tried leaving it there for a few minutes. Normal iPad behavior turns that off after a few minutes, and this does the same, putting it back in the bootloop. \n\n  \nWe believe the problem is that the iPad is so dead that it can't start the firmware needed to properly initiate charging. A potential solution to this would be a jumpstart, but not only would we not know how to do this, but it could be dangerous. The other solution would be to take the battery out, charge it externally, and put it back together. We have a lot of iPads that are broken, however, and no experience doing this. Assuming it's even possible. ",

We already tried pressing F2 while the computer is still loading and this gives us two possibilities: reformatting the computer (which could possibly delete all the softwares previously installed bc he has never done a backup - so it's better if we avoid this) or reinstalling all windows applications (we tried this, but it leads to an error bc windows applications have already been installed). Pressing the keyboard, once the computer has turned on, leads to nothing, as the computer doesn't get the signal from the USB keyboard. I have no clue why the mouse and the keyboard can be used while the computer is loading, but not once my father gets inside his account. Any help is appreciated.",

Im getting timed out of websites left and right. Its so bad that i get timed out of my own router's website (if i enter the gateway ip, no issues, if i use url, timeout).\n\nFirst, I tried to single out if the issue is on my side or my isp. So I got an Ethernet to usb c adapter and tested on my laptop. That is, from the apartment directly to the laptop. I had no issues here. Everything worked as it should. But, as soon as i plug the cable back to the WAN port, back to square 1.\n\nI have tried changing the router just in case, but that didnt resolve it. And I am currently out of ideas. I have no idea what to do now. \n\nSome commands i ran on PowerShell:\nWhile its plugged into the router:\n\nNslookup www.google.com 1.1.1.1 (or 8.8.8.8) resulted in timeout multiple times.\nTest-NetConnection 1.1.1.1 (or 8.8.8.8) -Port 53 resulted in tcptestsucceeded = false\n\nThe commands above resulted in success when directly connected to my laptop though. \n\nAnyone who has any pointers?

    "title": "Internet on my computer randomly slowed down",
    "selftext": "Hey guys, so ever since around two weeks ago my internet on my computer has just randomly slowed down? I've tried to come up with fixes like moving my computer a tad bit in my room. I currently have my computer upstairs in my room, my router is located downstairs and I'm unable to move my computer downstairs or even move my router. I've (temporarily) fixed this issue in the past with a wifi usb adapter (specifically the tp-link ax1800), and that sped up my internet by a lot for around 10 months, but now it's just suddenly slowed down, even the usb adapter is having trouble and it constantly says no internet. \n\nI'd like to add that my room does receive the worst wifi connection in my house (yes I've looked at wifi repeaters but I'm not too sure how reliable those are since people complain about the latency?) \n\nOne last thing, my router can directly tell me my internet speeds with a display and the upload speed is around 1700Mbps and my download is around 1000Mbps.\n\nIf you guys need anymore information I'd be glad to provide, help would be much appreciated, thanks!",
