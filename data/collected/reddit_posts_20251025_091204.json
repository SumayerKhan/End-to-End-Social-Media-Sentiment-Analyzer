    "selftext": ">The new M5 equipped 14” MacBook Pros offer few new features other than a modest performance bump, a new architecture which doubles the maximum storage options from 2TB to 4TB and a substantial increase in SSD read/write speeds and memory bandwidth. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for improvement when designing for repairability, especially where Apple’s complex engineering is concerned. So the big question remaining from this year's big M5 announcement is: did Apple upgrade the MacBook Pro’s repairability?",

    "selftext": "Hey, I am from Ukraine and want to raise a critical situation that is happening among the dev community. First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hey, I am from Ukraine and want to raise a critical situation that is happening among the dev community. First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

I've  had USB-C loosen over time and have seen them get destroyed by there hollow design but the lightning port was a plug that you didn't have to worry about as much and was easier to clean. Why at least not make it a little bigger on a redesign or something to compete? I like USB-C, but I was always curious why Apple never continued to innovate a good port and cash cow.",

It’s like trying to curve a spinning ball in Pokemon Go all over again lol\n\nI’ve googled and tried the accessibility touch feature, but that only adds a Home button, doesn’t let me open the carousel. \n\nIs there any known shortcut to do this easily with a button press, like how it was done on older models? Thanks in advance 🙏 ",

I’m the type of person who never uses the camera, much less edit photos and stuff like that, so it actually feels good to let go something you’re dragging around all the time and never use. I do watch a lot of YouTube, I’ve dropped the phone on my face so many times, so it was just the Air mono speaker what was holding me back.\n\nDecided to pull the trigger and I instantly noticed how much I actually care about lightness and portability. This thing feels like “you’re just holding the screen”, if that makes sense, and I don’t think I can go back to a brick anymore. The speaker is ok to rot in bed watching reels and short content, but I’ll say this: forget about landscape mode. It’s a bit unbearable, so I’ve been using my AirPods much more. I do miss the Pro speakers, but I don’t feel that compelled to return it for the Pro…\n\nFor people that made a similar change, what’s your experience so far? What are your thoughts on the mono speaker?",

I would rather the warranty get voided but I am able to recover the data and fix the phone itself. I also don't want to have to pay more than like 2-300 just to fix it either\n\nAlso, I have read that trying to update it to a newer version may fix the problem, but in my case, the only available versions are the beta version of ios 26.

    "selftext": "Hello all, just after some help from people smarter than me.\n\nWhen you receive a text message from a service that displays as a name rather than a number, I think they’re called an Alpha Tag.\n\nI’m trying to have a different text tone for a specific service. \n\nIt appears you can’t save the “Alpha Tag” to a contact, and then have a custom text tone. Assigning a contact a different text or ring tone is the only way I know how to do it.\n\nAnyone know what I’m missing or have any ideas?",

If you upgrade online, you may be charged an incident fee after your iPhone is received and assessed for damage. If you upgrade at an Apple Store, you may be charged an incident fee at that time. For more information on fees, learn more about AppleCare coverage”\n\nJust a warning for everyone. I traded in my 16 pro for a 17 pro. I participate in the Apple IPhone Upgrade program every year which includes Apple Care for the phone. \n\nI had a small crack on the back glass of the phone. It never bothered me, so I never utilized apple care to fix it. I was happy to just be charged the apple care repair fee when the time came to trade it in. I researched this decision prior to making it and found the official Apple FAQ page quoted above confirming this was acceptable to do. \n\nI was on the phone with Apple Support for 30min yesterday trying to resolve this headache. I was told the back glass crack was the only reason the phone was being sent back. When I asked why I wasn’t just charged my Apple Care repair fee to close out the loan and accept the trade in - the associate did not know. They said the phone was already being sent back to me and tried to tell me I should send the phone back to repair with my Apple care then send the repaired phone back as a 2nd attempt on the trade in, all while paying the extra loan payments for however long this takes. I said that makes no sense and is not an acceptable solution. They’re going to escalate it to a specialist who should contact me in the next couple days. \n\nThis has been a lot of anxiety and extra burden on my time for no reason other than Apple’s mistake. I feel the fair solution at this point would be for them to somehow reverse the shipping back to them, accept the trade in, and wave the repair fee to compensate me for the extra time I’ve spent trying to correct their mistake.

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "selftext": "Switched from 15PM —> Air. The original reason why I got the 15PM was because of the 120Hz display, but after a couple years I swear my pinky is deformed. I’m the type of person who never uses the camera, much less edit photos and stuff like that, so it actually feels good to let go something you’re dragging around all the time and never use. I do watch a lot of YouTube, I’ve dropped the phone on my face so many times, so it was just the Air mono speaker what was holding me back.\n\nDecided to pull the trigger and I instantly noticed how much I actually care about lightness and portability. This thing feels like “you’re just holding the screen”, if that makes sense, and I don’t think I can go back to a brick anymore. The speaker is ok to rot in bed watching reels and short content, but I’ll say this: forget about landscape mode. It’s a bit unbearable, so I’ve been using my AirPods much more. I do miss the Pro speakers, but I don’t feel that compelled to return it for the Pro…\n\nFor people that made a similar change, what’s your experience so far? What are your thoughts on the mono speaker?",

    "selftext": "Switched from 15PM —> Air. The original reason why I got the 15PM was because of the 120Hz display, but after a couple years I swear my pinky is deformed. I’m the type of person who never uses the camera, much less edit photos and stuff like that, so it actually feels good to let go something you’re dragging around all the time and never use. I do watch a lot of YouTube, I’ve dropped the phone on my face so many times, so it was just the Air mono speaker what was holding me back.\n\nDecided to pull the trigger and I instantly noticed how much I actually care about lightness and portability. This thing feels like “you’re just holding the screen”, if that makes sense, and I don’t think I can go back to a brick anymore. The speaker is ok to rot in bed watching reels and short content, but I’ll say this: forget about landscape mode. It’s a bit unbearable, so I’ve been using my AirPods much more. I do miss the Pro speakers, but I don’t feel that compelled to return it for the Pro…\n\nFor people that made a similar change, what’s your experience so far? What are your thoughts on the mono speaker?",

The iPhone Fold design has been finalized internally and will be delivering next year. This is, roughly, what that design will look like.\n\nThe iPhone Fold will be a passport style foldable, much like the under-appreciated Huawei Pura X. The main screen is an awkward aspect ratio, but it's small, offering roughly the same real estate as an iPhone Mini.\n\nThese renders and concept art comes from MacRumors Forum user iZac:\nhttps://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumoured-iphone-fold-size-concept-drawing-and-renders.2456447/",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre’s report clearly mentioned “Display – step mark on display.”\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called “flagship quality” completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care — never dropped, always in Samsung’s original case and protector — yet the display failed twice. It’s shocking how a premium device costing nearly ₹1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite — big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you’re left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand’s promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course). I would LOVE if google would implement Android XR in Android. I dont mind my phone getting hot but I wouldn't have to sync my photos and all of that.",

You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "selftext": "Recently, I was searching for flip phone reviews and saw an article on the Vertu website. The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre’s report clearly mentioned “Display – step mark on display.”\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called “flagship quality” completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care — never dropped, always in Samsung’s original case and protector — yet the display failed twice. It’s shocking how a premium device costing nearly ₹1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite — big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you’re left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand’s promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "title": "My < 14 months old Pixel 9 Pro XL is a brick!!",
    "selftext": "Up until this Wednesday evening, I was almost happy with my phone - some hiccups though over the span of 12 months - blank screen, sudden hang ups, brightness issues, overheating when using video etc. Despite all these bugs, this was the best android phone I had ever used - sleek, stylish, smooth and snappy.....buggy though..... - but tough love!! <3 \n\nJust after making a call, I pressed the power button. Little did I know this would be the last time I would have used the device. It died! No matter how many CPRs ([Google Pixel 9 Pro (XL) Black Screen Of Death? (SOLVED)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRwlpGb1gqk)) I would try!!! Then came the awakening. I visited the so called Google Exclusive Service Center in Bengaluru where I had to pay 850INR for inspection and on request they said the diagnosis would be done on priority. After 30 minutes, I went back and I was told the bad news which I expected anyways - \"The motherboard has died. You would need to pay 43000 INR for its replacement. Since it is already almost 2 months the warranty expired, this is not covered\" - The tone was not even consoling...haha....it was pitiful....I am a fairly average user with most of my usage being entertainment and browsing....this came as a shock to me!!\n\nI feel appalled because unlike our US counterparts, Indians have to shell out a major portion of their monthly salary to buy these flagship phones. Imagine earning 2Lacs a month and paying 1.25 Lacs for the device which promised 7 years of OS updates when ironically it is not even able to guarantee 14 months of lifespan.....IMHO this is pure deception and scam being inflicted on the people. I know this is not unlike other companies but hey at least OnePlus has owned its defects and came back with friendlier policies and even expanded it to India. It has ensured to expand its official service centres with very good staff across every major cities in the country unlike Google which has not bothered yet to work on after sales.\n\nThis was a lesson for me on a variety of topics in this life - from consumerism to capitalism, from self reflection to self destruction - we should not fall to marketing gimmicks and shenanigans these BigTech employ to make you feel like you are missing something if you dont have their products. I have learned a valuable lesson that **Don't buy a product which has close to negligible after sales service and negligible empathy for customers**. While Google does have a great software team, its hardware offerings are meh! I feel I cheated on my OP7T which still work like butter even now! Sorry OP!!!!!! \\_/\\\\\\_   \nI held back on buying a flagship phone for almost 10 years and now I think I should never have. :(\n\nI should have never expected in the first place that a company with such a poor and pathetic track record with hardware can create magical experience with mobile phones. After all phones are not just their looks. What matters the most is whether they can walk significantly with you in your life and whether the manufacturer actually has this intention. I am pretty sure Google doesn't especially not in countries like India.",

Is this true for the latest Pixel phones?\n2. Specifically, what is your experience with features like Magic Editor (the generative AI photo editing) or Magic Eraser, and the advanced Call Screening/Assistant features (like Hold For Me, etc.) when using the phone in an unsupported region like LATAM?\n3. Are there any legitimate ways to activate these blocked features (VPN, changing language/region settings, etc.)?\nI'm worried about paying a flagship price for a \"crippled\" phone.\n\nIdk I really like the pixel pro idea but it will be a shame if I can’t use all his potencial ",

The removal of the rear finger print sensor kept me from the 4 & the design of the rear camera bezel kept me from 6-8. Plus I think many of us agree that 5 was peak. I didn't know that until I made the change.\n\nI had hoped that the 9 would grow on me, but I continue to hate its bulkiness.

    "selftext": "Google Case no.: 4-1941000040097  &  4-4312000039720\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m extremely disappointed with how Google Support has handled my Pixel 7 battery swelling issue. My phone’s battery expanded, pushing up the screen — a clear hardware defect that many Pixel 7 users have reported.\n\nAfter multiple emails and days of waiting, Google Support said they would refund the amount only the battery replacement if done through their authorized service partner **CTDI (Aperia Mall, Singapore)**, but not other parts. This is unreasonable, as previous similar cases were covered entirely under warranty or goodwill.\n\nFinally, I had no choice but to accept the change of battery only, since my screen was still working. I brought my device to Google’s authorized service partner, CTDI. However, to my horror they **refused to replace just the battery** and **insisted that it is a policy I must also replace the screen**, the LCD cost about **SGD 200++**— even though the swelling itself caused the damage.\n\nThis feels like an outright **scam or cost-shifting tactic** — forcing customers to pay for screen replacement that resulted from a **known manufacturing defect**. Google should take full responsibility instead of making users pay for damage caused by their own hardware fault.\n\nI’m without a working device for 5days+, and Google took their time to get back to me despite countless chasers, the lack of urgency is very disappointing.\n\nAt the end of the day, \n\n1. I made wasted trips down to service center (wasted time and transport fare)\n2. Unnecessary aggravation - service center insist I needed to change both screen + battery.\n3. Still without a functioning phone after 5 days+\n\nService Partner, CTDI, did sense my frustration and took my phone in to escalate to Google, However this would be at least a 3 business days process (with no guarantee) + 2 days of weekend.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue recently?\n\nDid Google cover both the battery and screen replacement for you? \n\nIf you’re facing the same problem, please make your voice heard. The more of us report it, the harder it’ll be for Google to ignore this widespread defect.",

I contacted Google and they told me I should talk to FedEx.\n4. After 3 weeks, I was able to get on the phone with someone from FedEx after Google gave me the shipping destination.  They declared the device lost/ stolen.\n5. After two more weeks, Google has yet to do anything.  I have contacted them multiple times, and they just keep telling me a \"specialist\" is working on my case and they can't escalate it any further.\n\nIt has been over a month.

Basically this is a motherboard issue and you have to either repair  the IC in it or change the whole motherboard. Most probably the repair guy repaired the IC in my device’s motherboard. So, just after 6-7 weeks from that repair my device’s OS became very buggy. At first, 1 or 2 apps used to crash for like a week or two. That means whenever I tried to open that app, it used to crash immediately and that app was inaccessible for a week long. After a period of time it used to go back to normal but another new app would have started to face the same issue. By time the issue got worse and number of apps crashing increased to a point where only a handful of apps was accessible. So, right now the whole phone is completely inaccessible and is stuck in the booting screen just as the attached image. The phone doesn’t go past this loading screen. Factory resetting might help in this case but I have a lot of important photos and videos in this device. Those are some of the most valuable memories of my life with my family and friends. I just don’t wanna lose them. Thats why I’m seeking help that if there are any ways I can recover my data or repair the phone without losing the data. THANKS IN ADVANCE.",

I narrated as though I was discussing the Fall foliage with my dog, very silly and random.\n\nTonight I was playing them back. Suddenly, in one video, the audio changed from my voice to wild animals or maybe werewolves roaring and attacking, with loud clanking of chains, and the panicky cries of some ululating birds in the distance. (No such animals where I live. Nor werewolves.) It was like a horror film. \n\nI'm perplexed. I have never even edited a video, but I guess I accidentally edited these sounds in? But how could I do that accidentally? \n\nI wish I could have the original audio of my own voice back, because I was chatting and interacting with my dog, and she's near the end of her life -- I wanted a nice memory of us together.\n\nAny theories re. how I added these weird noises, and/or how I can get rid of them, would be welcome. \n\nEDIT: I saw that I accidentally switched the taping speed to slow motion -- that changed the audio a lot. And someone mentioned maybe adding audio emojis unintentionally; trying to figure out if I did that (I had never used such things). Last night I would have sworn these sounds were real animals, today...I think maybe not.\n\nI know I sound like a crazy person and I don't blame anybody for thinking I'm making this up, lol. My dog is 14 and has cancer and I wanted a video of us together, in the park that she loves. So getting a video to share means editing out parts where I'm crying, finding a piece where I'm speaking normally, and also getting a piece where the weird sounds happen. I have never edited a video and I'm so afraid of losing the whole thing. \n\nI just want to thank anyone who took the time to respond, and I'm sorry I couldn't work out sharing the video -- but with the help of YouTube and Google, I *may* manage it yet. If so, I will post it here even though it might take a week and no one will see it! \n\n",

    "selftext": "So, as many might have seen, samsung just launched their Samsung Galaxy xr headset. As a big feature they also announced media auto-spatialization in Google Fotos which seems to be similar to apples 3d conversion.\n\nNow I'm wondering/hoping since it's like a feature of Google Fotos If it might make it's way to the normal pixels since it would also be great to have spatial meadia like this for other headsets like quest or pico.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this and is a a possible thing to happen in one way or another?",

    "selftext": "edit: \\*The crop tool in GALLERY. The crop tool in Photos is how it *should* be.\n\nThe circles you have to press are right up against the edge of the screen meaning 1) They're very hard to touch with a phone case on 2) swiping them is the same gesture as \"back\" 3) you have to long press them to avoid the back gesture which is annoying and combined with the phone case half the time the drag is cancelled and you have to start over 4) since they're butted up against the edge of the screen, trying to make the selected area larger is VERY unwieldy \n\nFor the love of god just put some padding around the cropping screen, it's not hard! You hire the finest minds and pay millions of dollars for UI experts, this is so simple!!!",

It hasn't been going on long, maybe a week, but this is getting supremely annoying.\n\n(I have a Google Pixel 6)",

    "title": "My < 14 months old Pixel 9 Pro XL is a brick!!",
    "selftext": "Up until this Wednesday evening, I was almost happy with my phone - some hiccups though over the span of 12 months - blank screen, sudden hang ups, brightness issues, overheating when using video etc. Despite all these bugs, this was the best android phone I had ever used - sleek, stylish, smooth and snappy.....buggy though..... - but tough love!! <3 \n\nJust after making a call, I pressed the power button. Little did I know this would be the last time I would have used the device. It died! No matter how many CPRs ([Google Pixel 9 Pro (XL) Black Screen Of Death? (SOLVED)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRwlpGb1gqk)) I would try!!! Then came the awakening. I visited the so called Google Exclusive Service Center in Bengaluru where I had to pay 850INR for inspection and on request they said the diagnosis would be done on priority. After 30 minutes, I went back and I was told the bad news which I expected anyways - \"The motherboard has died. You would need to pay 43000 INR for its replacement. Since it is already almost 2 months the warranty expired, this is not covered\" - The tone was not even consoling...haha....it was pitiful....I am a fairly average user with most of my usage being entertainment and browsing....this came as a shock to me!!\n\nI feel appalled because unlike our US counterparts, Indians have to shell out a major portion of their monthly salary to buy these flagship phones. Imagine earning 2Lacs a month and paying 1.25 Lacs for the device which promised 7 years of OS updates when ironically it is not even able to guarantee 14 months of lifespan.....IMHO this is pure deception and scam being inflicted on the people. I know this is not unlike other companies but hey at least OnePlus has owned its defects and came back with friendlier policies and even expanded it to India. It has ensured to expand its official service centres with very good staff across every major cities in the country unlike Google which has not bothered yet to work on after sales.\n\nThis was a lesson for me on a variety of topics in this life - from consumerism to capitalism, from self reflection to self destruction - we should not fall to marketing gimmicks and shenanigans these BigTech employ to make you feel like you are missing something if you dont have their products. I have learned a valuable lesson that **Don't buy a product which has close to negligible after sales service and negligible empathy for customers**. While Google does have a great software team, its hardware offerings are meh! I feel I cheated on my OP7T which still work like butter even now! Sorry OP!!!!!! \\_/\\\\\\_   \nI held back on buying a flagship phone for almost 10 years and now I think I should never have. :(\n\nI should have never expected in the first place that a company with such a poor and pathetic track record with hardware can create magical experience with mobile phones. After all phones are not just their looks. What matters the most is whether they can walk significantly with you in your life and whether the manufacturer actually has this intention. I am pretty sure Google doesn't especially not in countries like India.",

So, just after 6-7 weeks from that repair my device’s OS became very buggy. At first, 1 or 2 apps used to crash for like a week or two. That means whenever I tried to open that app, it used to crash immediately and that app was inaccessible for a week long. After a period of time it used to go back to normal but another new app would have started to face the same issue. By time the issue got worse and number of apps crashing increased to a point where only a handful of apps was accessible. So, right now the whole phone is completely inaccessible and is stuck in the booting screen just as the attached image. The phone doesn’t go past this loading screen. Factory resetting might help in this case but I have a lot of important photos and videos in this device. Those are some of the most valuable memories of my life with my family and friends. I just don’t wanna lose them. Thats why I’m seeking help that if there are any ways I can recover my data or repair the phone without losing the data. THANKS IN ADVANCE.",

My phone’s battery expanded, pushing up the screen — a clear hardware defect that many Pixel 7 users have reported.\n\nAfter multiple emails and days of waiting, Google Support said they would refund the amount only the battery replacement if done through their authorized service partner **CTDI (Aperia Mall, Singapore)**, but not other parts. This is unreasonable, as previous similar cases were covered entirely under warranty or goodwill.\n\nFinally, I had no choice but to accept the change of battery only, since my screen was still working. I brought my device to Google’s authorized service partner, CTDI. However, to my horror they **refused to replace just the battery** and **insisted that it is a policy I must also replace the screen**, the LCD cost about **SGD 200++**— even though the swelling itself caused the damage.\n\nThis feels like an outright **scam or cost-shifting tactic** — forcing customers to pay for screen replacement that resulted from a **known manufacturing defect**. Google should take full responsibility instead of making users pay for damage caused by their own hardware fault.\n\nI’m without a working device for 5days+, and Google took their time to get back to me despite countless chasers, the lack of urgency is very disappointing.\n\nAt the end of the day, \n\n1. I made wasted trips down to service center (wasted time and transport fare)\n2. Unnecessary aggravation - service center insist I needed to change both screen + battery.\n3. Still without a functioning phone after 5 days+\n\nService Partner, CTDI, did sense my frustration and took my phone in to escalate to Google, However this would be at least a 3 business days process (with no guarantee) + 2 days of weekend.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue recently?\n\nDid Google cover both the battery and screen replacement for you? \n\nIf you’re facing the same problem, please make your voice heard. The more of us report it, the harder it’ll be for Google to ignore this widespread defect.",

Disable battery optimization (important)\n2. Turn on precise location\n3. Clear the cache\n4. Force close the app\n\nDo this for all three apps. Then restart your phone.

    "selftext": "Up until this Wednesday evening, I was almost happy with my phone - some hiccups though over the span of 12 months - blank screen, sudden hang ups, brightness issues, overheating when using video etc. Despite all these bugs, this was the best android phone I had ever used - sleek, stylish, smooth and snappy.....buggy though..... - but tough love!! <3 \n\nJust after making a call, I pressed the power button. Little did I know this would be the last time I would have used the device. It died! No matter how many CPRs ([Google Pixel 9 Pro (XL) Black Screen Of Death? (SOLVED)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRwlpGb1gqk)) I would try!!! Then came the awakening. I visited the so called Google Exclusive Service Center in Bengaluru where I had to pay 850INR for inspection and on request they said the diagnosis would be done on priority. After 30 minutes, I went back and I was told the bad news which I expected anyways - \"The motherboard has died. You would need to pay 43000 INR for its replacement. Since it is already almost 2 months the warranty expired, this is not covered\" - The tone was not even consoling...haha....it was pitiful....I am a fairly average user with most of my usage being entertainment and browsing....this came as a shock to me!!\n\nI feel appalled because unlike our US counterparts, Indians have to shell out a major portion of their monthly salary to buy these flagship phones. Imagine earning 2Lacs a month and paying 1.25 Lacs for the device which promised 7 years of OS updates when ironically it is not even able to guarantee 14 months of lifespan.....IMHO this is pure deception and scam being inflicted on the people. I know this is not unlike other companies but hey at least OnePlus has owned its defects and came back with friendlier policies and even expanded it to India. It has ensured to expand its official service centres with very good staff across every major cities in the country unlike Google which has not bothered yet to work on after sales.\n\nThis was a lesson for me on a variety of topics in this life - from consumerism to capitalism, from self reflection to self destruction - we should not fall to marketing gimmicks and shenanigans these BigTech employ to make you feel like you are missing something if you dont have their products. I have learned a valuable lesson that **Don't buy a product which has close to negligible after sales service and negligible empathy for customers**. While Google does have a great software team, its hardware offerings are meh! I feel I cheated on my OP7T which still work like butter even now! Sorry OP!!!!!! \\_/\\\\\\_   \nI held back on buying a flagship phone for almost 10 years and now I think I should never have. :(\n\nI should have never expected in the first place that a company with such a poor and pathetic track record with hardware can create magical experience with mobile phones. After all phones are not just their looks. What matters the most is whether they can walk significantly with you in your life and whether the manufacturer actually has this intention. I am pretty sure Google doesn't especially not in countries like India.",

    "selftext": "Earlier this year I repaired my pixel 7 due to the “Black Screen of Death”. Basically this is a motherboard issue and you have to either repair  the IC in it or change the whole motherboard. Most probably the repair guy repaired the IC in my device’s motherboard. So, just after 6-7 weeks from that repair my device’s OS became very buggy. At first, 1 or 2 apps used to crash for like a week or two. That means whenever I tried to open that app, it used to crash immediately and that app was inaccessible for a week long. After a period of time it used to go back to normal but another new app would have started to face the same issue. By time the issue got worse and number of apps crashing increased to a point where only a handful of apps was accessible. So, right now the whole phone is completely inaccessible and is stuck in the booting screen just as the attached image. The phone doesn’t go past this loading screen. Factory resetting might help in this case but I have a lot of important photos and videos in this device. Those are some of the most valuable memories of my life with my family and friends. I just don’t wanna lose them. Thats why I’m seeking help that if there are any ways I can recover my data or repair the phone without losing the data. THANKS IN ADVANCE.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "title": "My long-term experience with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra (and why I still love it)",
    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

I eventually switched to iPhone with the 12 Pro, and 5 years later it still feels just as smooth as the day I got it.\n\nNow I’m considering going back to Android with the S26, but I don’t want to deal with the same old performance issues if Samsung hasn’t really fixed this.\n\nFor those of you who’ve stuck with Samsung in recent years, how does long-term performance hold up? Are they still prone to slowing down or is it finally on par with iOS for longevity?",

They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

    "selftext": "Love this! I’m a working mom in tech (crazy hours) and also a military veteran with back issues. I didn’t realize how convenient this machine might be when I bought this (costco deal!) I’ll def check in later in a couple months with quirks. If you’re an engineer that worked on this product - thank you!\n\n1. Loads a bunch of wash fluids (detergent & such). Back saver. \n2. I just set and forget. Literally can get a load done overnight!! Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. \n3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. \n4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don’t have to do that anymore. \n5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.\n\nQuirks\n- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed. I would like to have a simple play button (which would do AI wash) for my parents and my young daughter who I’m going to start to train to load and start. ",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

My main complaints were the short battery life and longer time to charge, camera quality, and phone temperature during regular use/charging (it gets really warm on the outter screen). Maybe sometime in the future Samsung will bring the Z series closer to the ultra given their higher pricing. ",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

I'm primarily looking forward to ecg and blood pressure as I'm lacking these in my current Huawei Fit3.\n\nMy question is: I'm currently using a Galaxy A55 5G. Will either watch lack any features when I pair with my phone, as I'm not seeing myself changing it for a couple more years. Are there some features (especially regarding activity and health metrics) that I could only have with an upper Samsung phone or a Huawei phone respectively? I know this was the case until recently but I couldn't find much info on these never models.\n\nAnd I know it comes down to personal preferences and tastes, but which watch would be better in my usage case?\n\nI should add, Samsung seems to release a non-LTE (only bluetooth) version in Turkey, where I live. So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

    "selftext": "Bought my GW Ultra late last year when they were giving insane deals/trade-ins and was blown away by how good it was.  However, over the last few months, my HR has been becoming completely unusable as the numbers would jump around so much that I knew they weren't correct.  (I've been a distance runner for almost twenty years so I know my HR very well and I knew the watch was giving poor info.)  I've had a couple of forced resets of my watch and even starting over from scratch has not improved things.\n\nFor my birthday last week, I got a gift card to Amazon and I decided to finally purchase a HR monitor with a chest strap.  Found an unbelievable deal on one for only $20 and thought I'd try it.  Today, on its first run, I saw just how bad my Ultra was really performing.\n\nIn the pic below, the top picture is the still very new Ultra during a 2.5 mile run.  It climbs steadily until reaching my \"cruising\" HR, which will usually be between 145-155, depending on my exertion level that day.  The top pic is very acceptable to me.  I was doing a lot of HR zone training back then and with a good HR sensor, it was easily accomplished.\n\nThe bottom pic is today's run, a 1.55 mile treadmill run.  (Sorry, it was 38 degrees and raining, so not going outside!)  You can see a very similar HR pattern as the new Ultra had in the top pic.  A steady climb into the cruising zone and stayed there for the duration.  Never got above 150 the entire time.\n\nThe middle pic is yesterday's run, one mile on the treadmill using the Ultra only.  Wow, what a disaster.  All over the place and a couple of minute-long flatlines.  Also, notice the high of 171, which I know my heart never came near.  Definitely a cadence-lock issue, because my running cadence is always between 168 and 174.\n\nI'm one of those tactile-intolerant people and I thought for sure I'd hate running with this strap on my chest but I barely even noticed it the entire time.  The beauty is, once SportWerks has discovered the BLE device, it is stored and it will automatically find the device every time in the future so as long as I remember to put it on, it's as simple as that.\n\nNot sure why these things simply \"go bad\" but apparently, mine has.  Sharing this because I've seen enough posts from other runners/cyclists to know they are also having HR sensor issues.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn17yc8ijxwf1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=91a25d27193cc4e24239c1554d50b2a76870b84e\n\n",

Ongoing tasks will appear in the Now bar at the bottom of your watch face so you can check key information quickly.\n\nDo more with double pinch  \nJust pinch your thumb and index finger together twice to scroll through notifications, control music, take pictures, and more. You can also customize what happens when you double pinch on the watch face, music controller, as well as alarm, calendar, and reminder alerts. Choose the actions you need most in each situation.\n\nMark reminders as important  \nMark reminders as important by tapping the Star icon. You can choose to have important reminders pinned to the top of the list to make sure you notice them.\n\nNew charging effects  \nWhen your watch is charging, the new screen layout and animations make it easier to check the current battery level and remaining charging time.\n\n**Stay connected**\n\nEasily respond to notifications and alerts  \nUse gestures to quickly respond to notifications and alerts. When a notification appears, you can double pinch to view the details or send a reply. You can also shake your wrist to return to the watch face.\n\nEnhanced notification view  \nNotifications on your watch are now easier to use with an attractive new design. Notifications from the same app are stacked vertically, allowing you to view more notifications with fewer swipes.\n\nSmarter notification settings  \nIt's now easier to decide how to receive notifications from your phone on your watch. If you choose Smart device selection, notifications will appear on your phone only when you're using it and on your watch when you're not using your phone. If you choose Always show on both, notifications will always appear on both your phone and watch.\n\n**Upgrade your health**\n\nRunning coach  \nWhether you're a beginner or an experienced runner, the new Running coach feature in Samsung Health provides personalized training programs and tips to help you run farther and faster while minimizing the risk of injury.\n\nBedtime guidance  \nGet to sleep at the right time so you wake up feeling refreshed. The new Bedtime guidance feature analyzes your sleep data and recommends the best time to go to sleep each night.\n\nMindfulness  \nManage stress and anxiety in your daily life with the new Mindfulness feature in Samsung Health. You can keep track of your moods and emotions and practice breathing exercises to reduce stress.\n\n**Tailored to you**\n\nFind the perfect watch face  \nIt's now easier to find the watch face that's right for you. Just choose a few keywords such as your preferred style, color, and information to show. The best matches will be suggested from our collection of more than 300 watch faces.\n\nRecommended watch faces  \nDiscover new watch faces that you might like. Watch faces with colors, style, or information similar to your current watch face will be recommended on the watch face selection screen.\n\nCreate your own tiles  \nCreate your own custom tiles that show the information you need. You can even combine information from different apps into a single tile. You can include weather information, calendar events, reminders, and more.\n\nPersonalized Apps screen  \nFeatured apps now appear at the top of your Apps screen to give you quick access to the apps you need the most. Apps will be featured based on how often you use them and other usage patterns. You can also view your apps as a list with names instead of only icons.\n\nChoose calendars to show on your watch  \nYou can now choose which calendars to show in the Calendar app on your watch. You can show all of the same calendars that are on your phone or customize to show only the calendars you need.\n\n  \n**Sadly there are no any:**\n\n  \nTrack your vascular load  \nUse your Galaxy Watch to measure your vascular load, which is the amount of stress on your blood vessels. First, take a baseline measurement, then you'll be able to see when your vascular load gets higher or lower over time.  \n  \nCheck your antioxidant intake  \nThe Antioxidant index (Labs) feature on your watch detects the level of carotenoids in your skin. Carotenoids are a type of antioxidant contained in fruits and vegetables that can help prevent physical aging.\n\nP.S. It's not bad update overall, but most important features as always Samsung hold just for Ultra models.",

Not everyone is into spending hundreds on a Smartwatch or Ring.\n\n\\-It has great battery life.  I'm fine with the shorter battery life of my Watch 7, but I know that none of these people I set up with a Fit 3 would put up with having to charge their watch every 1-2 days.\n\n\\-It's not bulky.  I don't consider my Watch 7 bulky either, certainly not compared to something like a Watch Ultra, but the Fit 3 is a truly lightweight device.\n\n\\-Has all the basic smartwatch features covered.  I'm amazed how well it integrates with Google Messages when receiving texts.  It's great that it still shows you when you are getting a call (even though you can't answer them).  It handles all the core health tracking.  Built-in find-your-phone feature, fall alerts, etc.\n\n\\-Low maintenance.  No apps that need to update constantly.  The Fit 3 itself turns on and off very quick.  This also makes it a great backup watch.  My old Watch 4 Classic on the other-hand, I have to turn it on periodically just to keep the apps updated and it takes a while, uses maybe 10% of the battery just finishing the boot-up process.\n\n  \nNow obviously each watch has it's own pros and cons, but the Fit 3 does a really great job at not just being a cheap watch, but actually doing certain things better than the more expensive watches and creating a great option to bring a big group of people into the Samsung smartwatch / Samsung health ecosystem.",

There I enter my credentials, complete 2FA and I get a screen saying:\n\nContinue with ********@*****.com\n\nApplicable service: Samsung Health\n\nContinue\n\nCancel\n\nI tap continue, and I am momentarily taken back to the Samsung Health app, I see a glimpse of something loading, and then I am taken back to the browser to the same \"Continue with ... \" screen, and then none of the two options to continue or to cancel work (I mean I tap them and they do nothing). If I go back to Samsung Health, the loading circle spins indefinitely and I actually have to close the app and I need to close it then open it up again, and then the cycle repeats.\n\nWhile I am still able to use my watch through the Galaxy Wearable app, this issue is severely impacting my experience, as I am basically blocked from using basic health features.\n\nI've tried all the usual troubleshooting steps: Clearing cache and data of Samsung Health, reinstalling Samsung Health, downloading, using a different browser (Samsung Internet instead of Google Chrome), restarting the phone. I am using a Redmi Note 12 running HyperOS 2.\n\nIf someone has any idea how to fix that, any help would be much appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",

I find the former more attractive but both seem to have similar activity and health metrics, which I'm more interested in.\n\nI'm swimming (pool and open water) and will start running; both not rigorously/competitive but for good health. I'm primarily looking forward to ecg and blood pressure as I'm lacking these in my current Huawei Fit3.\n\nMy question is: I'm currently using a Galaxy A55 5G. Will either watch lack any features when I pair with my phone, as I'm not seeing myself changing it for a couple more years. Are there some features (especially regarding activity and health metrics) that I could only have with an upper Samsung phone or a Huawei phone respectively? I know this was the case until recently but I couldn't find much info on these never models.\n\nAnd I know it comes down to personal preferences and tastes, but which watch would be better in my usage case?\n\nI should add, Samsung seems to release a non-LTE (only bluetooth) version in Turkey, where I live. So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

Since it's only a year old, I'm wondering if it's still a good choice in 2025 for getting started with professional-level editing and graphic design. My budget doesn't allow for a high-end PC, and I'm new to this field, so I'm worried about whether this MacBook can handle tasks like 1080p or even 4K video editing. Is it a good machine to start with, or will I regret this decision later?\"",

Mine got only one.\n\nSo i was checking and thinking of buying a hub for type C, and I noticed options are very limited in my market. And some of theese hubs are not clear whether your device would be recognized by them or they only do file transfer job… moreover, most of these hubs just have other type of ports. I can’t find a USB C hub that gives you 3 or 4 usb C ports, the way we see in USB A hubs. The existing usb c hubs are mostly having different types of ports rather than usb c.\n\nWhat sort of hub should i look for? Whats the solution?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m using a Thunderobot Borui ZGM (model NL50MU-H) laptop running Windows 11, and I’ve noticed something strange, whenever the Thunderbolt icon next to my battery icon blinks, my laptop lags for a second or two, the mouse stutters and apps freeze briefly.\n\nA few notes about my setup:\n\nI use a round barrel charger, not USB-C power.\n\nThe charging light next to the port stays solid when my laptop is off, the opposite if the laptop is on.\n\nI’m not using any Thunderbolt or USB-C devices.\n\nThe Thunderbolt Control Center isn’t available on Windows 11, so I can’t check any Thunderbolt settings.\n\n\nIn Device Manager, the Thunderbolt controller shows up fine with no warning icons. I’ve also read that Windows 11 handles Thunderbolt 4/USB4 natively, so there aren’t separate Intel Thunderbolt drivers anymore.\n\nStill, the blinking icon seems to cause short system lags, which feels like the Thunderbolt controller or driver is repeatedly restarting in the background.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\nIs it a firmware or driver bug in Windows 11?\n\nCould it be fixed by a BIOS update or chipset reinstall?\n\n\nAny help or similar experiences would be really appreciated 🙏",

And some of theese hubs are not clear whether your device would be recognized by them or they only do file transfer job… moreover, most of these hubs just have other type of ports. I can’t find a USB C hub that gives you 3 or 4 usb C ports, the way we see in USB A hubs.

Is it a good machine to start with, or will I regret this decision later?\"",

Mine got only one.\n\nSo i was checking and thinking of buying a hub for type C, and I noticed options are very limited in my market. And some of theese hubs are not clear whether your device would be recognized by them or they only do file transfer job… moreover, most of these hubs just have other type of ports. I can’t find a USB C hub that gives you 3 or 4 usb C ports, the way we see in USB A hubs. The existing usb c hubs are mostly having different types of ports rather than usb c.\n\nWhat sort of hub should i look for? Whats the solution?",

I tried to reach out to our IT and all they tell me is to restart and clear my cache and cookies. How do I convince my IT that I need a bigger laptop?",

So far I upgraded the PSU from 650 to 850 and GPU from 1050ti to a RTX 3060.\n\nHowever, the PC only came with 500gb 'ish' of NVMe stoarge and for gaming it really fills up fast when Helldivers 2 is like 100gb of space.\n\nSince my mobo is the B450 Gaming Plus Max and doesn't support a second NVMe slot (as far as I know) I came to the conclusion of either upgrading my mobo to something newer or just cloning my NVMe storage drive to a newer one and slotting that into my PC. But I don't know if that's a good idea, future proofing wise.\n\nCan someone help and explain to me in Layman's terms since I am not the most intelligent?\n\nSpecs:\n\nMobo: B450 Gaming Plus Max \n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700\n\nGPU: RTX 3060\n\nRAM: 16GB DDR4\n\nStorage: Fanxiang 500gb NVMe\n\nPSU: 850w Gold Plated\n\nDon't know what my case is model wise, but it's a Deep Cool.",

I've been at this for at least 3 hours now and I'm just over it. I can't for the life of me figure out why this is refusing to align, and I think I'm just going to chip away at that top-left standoff to force it to be level, unless someone here can see something I've missed.

I think its when the crashing started. He started getting hypervisor crashes and random BSODs, which let me to believe that possibly 11 was killing his pc so he randomly bought a new mobo. Before we swapped it yesterday, about a week ago we tried our best to turn off anything hypervisor related but it didn't stop any of the crashing. I figured it wouldn't hurt so we swapped boards and I reinstalled 10 on it and hes been doing fine now for a few days, but the cpu freezing keeps occurring. Im possibly thinking its a bad L connect version? My first thought at the start was possibly too much power draw cause his pc sits at around 700w consumption and his psu is 850 but im not totally sure.

I built my first pc a few days ago (9060xt, 7600x3d) and it is great so far.   \nThe one thing bothering me is I have begun to notice a lot of texture pop-in in games I've played so far, like KCD2, RDR2, and even lighter games like PEAK. I'm just confused as to whether it's normal, or there is some sort of issue I don't know about. All my AAA gaming has been on console in the past, and only light gaming on my weak laptop, so I don't know exactly how much pop-in is normal on powerful PCs.  \n\n\nThe system is not running out of VRAM or RAM, and performance and temps are excellent otherwise.\n\n  \nI have attached a video of KCD2 here: [https://youtu.be/i8OLNnRFFS8](https://youtu.be/i8OLNnRFFS8)  \nIt is especially apparent on the right at the 0:36 mark.\n\nJust wondering if this is an issue or if it's normal in games and I'm just working myself up over nothing?

    "selftext": "I'll preface this by saying I am buying Intel, not AMD.  Unless I am just dumb as a brick and AMD really has finally stepped up.  Hard to believe any reviews I come across, because half of them put Intel having higher FPS and lower temps, and half of them put AMD having higher FPS and lower temps.. It's confusing for me.. I usually build a new gaming PC every few years, I was planning on 14th gen, but skipped past it with those microcode issues.  I have read those are resolved on new chips.  So I am looking to buy again.  That, and my 3080 has starting biting the dust with random black screens here and there.  Thankfully, EVGA is still honoring the warranty, so I will get a replacement 3080.  So why not upgrade everything?     \n \nHowever, my 3080 is a 10GB version, so it's struggling.  Up until games from this year, it's kept up just fine at my resolution, 3440x1440 on a 34\" 160Hz monitor.  Now getting into things like BL4 (I know, horrible optimization), BF6, ARC Raiders, and other games, I would like to push as much as I can. I usually get around 90-120 FPS in games I play.  Except BL4, of course, which is more like 50 after \"optimizing\" settings.   \n  \nI do game more than anything else with my PC.  Sometimes I edit videos for fun, not for publishing though.  \n  \nCurrent build is a 10700K, 32GB DDR4-3600, 3080 10GB, 850W PSU.  \n  \nShould I still stick with 14700K for gaming over a 265K, or even a 285K?  But at the 285K point, shouldn't I just get a 14900K?  Although, one reason I can think of for not going 14900K/285K, is I would prefer lower temps, less fan noise, etc.   On that note, I have always used 360MM AIOs.  Current one is a DeepCool castle 360EX, which is a monster, cools extremely well.  But as NA knows, DeepCool has since been banned from selling their products in NA.  So which 360 AIOs are best price/performance these days on the CPUs mentioned above?  \n  \nLastly, in terms of GPU, I know 5070 Ti is best price/performance when it comes to Nvidia, but at my resolution would it suffice in comparison to a 5080?  Much better than a 3080 I assume either way.    \n  \nI have done some math, and I think my 850W PSU will handle it.  It is an EVGA SuperNova 850 P2.  Or should I just go ahead and knock that up to 1000W to be safe?  \n  \nBudget isn't really a problem.  I just want to be sure I am getting a solid system for my 3440x1440 @ 160Hz, without going overboard and buying stuff I will never fully utilize.",

Grill it!\n\nThis isn’t a budget build but it’s not unlimited money either. So, for the price point I believe it’s great. Let me know!\n\nIn saying that -\nI could go cheaper on the case and get 2TB of m.2 but I want a good case and airflow and plenty of room for cable management. There is cheaper RAM but this is going to do the CPU justice. \n\nSolid PSU, solid gpu without spending an arm and a leg, WD sn850x is top notch, I feel like this build should be cheaper for the same exact (if not, negligible) performance AND quality though. I just can’t pinpoint it.",

Asus ROG Strix XG27ACS (394 usd)\n3.

Are there any aspects in which the Asus one outperforms the other, besides a marginally better refresh rate?",

Here are my specs; if someone could come to my aid to potentially find a solution for this.\n\nHere are my specs:  \nPower Supply: 600W 80 PLUS Gold PSU   \nStorage: 500GB M.2 NVMe SSD   \nMemory: 16GB DDR4-3200 RGB RAM   \nMotherboard: B660 MB   \nCPU: Intel Core i5-13400F   \nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 - 8GB",

This post is created also just out of curiousity, to see what other people think about making builds based of off framegen/upscaling tech. \n\nI play a mix of competetive games (i.e cs2) to offline games (i.e cyberpunk). I have been trying to find a good build to upgrade, because my current build has a motherboard with an AM4 socket. I basically have to change everything except my 3060 in my current build. \n\nI have been having a hard time wondering if I should get the 7600x and pair it with a new GPU, or keep the 3060 so I can have spare money to buy the 7800x3d to pair it with. Keep in mind, I live in Norway where GPUS are on average 250-300$ more expensive than in the US. \n\nI have been going on a deep rabbithole on lossless scaling. And it made me rethink the classic \"high end GPU > other components\" mindset. With how good upscaling and frame gen have become, it feels like you can get a lot more out of an old-gen GPU now than before. \n\nWith this in mind. What can you lose from using for example a 7800x3d w/ rtx 3060, and altering between: \n\n* Playing e-sport title on 1080p, with over 600fps \n* Playing offline games on 1440p, with over 60 fps + lossless scaling\n\nCould one say that this is a more \"future proof\" build, as opposed to buying a 7600?",

    "selftext": "Hello! My pc has been stuttering while playing Cs2 last couple of weeks and my Fps have went from stable 170-250 to going 200-110 Fps. All this happend when i suddenly got a black screen and my pc shut off, when i then restarted my pc i saw that all my graphic settings hade been changed to default in cs2 (this also happend 1 month ago while playing Schedule 1 with a friend). I tried too put the same graphic settings as i had before to the best off my ability, but it hasn't gotten better.\n\nMy pc specs\n\nCpu: Ryzen 5 3600 overclocked to 4.2 (Max temp around 90 avg 75-80)\n\nGpu: Amd Radeon 6600\n\nram: corsair 2x8 gb 3600 Mhz ddr4\n\nmotherboard: b450 aorus\n\npcu: CV550\n\nI would like to know if my pc is just shit or if something is wrong or perhaps if something is about to give up on me. I have been considering uppgrading to either ryzen 5 5600x or ryzen 7 58003DX but then i probably also need an aio cooler but i dont know where to put it because i have like 7 fans and then i would need to remove some. Any suggestions or insights on what to do or what is wrong with my pc?",

I have never messed with this.\n\nAnyways fast forward 8+ hours and I have been in and out of the bios trying to get it to work.

I have to remove my graphics card and then remove my motherboard cmos battery.\n\nI never thought I would be good at removing that battery, but I have been back and fourth trying everything I can think of.  I have changed my drives to GPT.  I have updated drivers.  I have tried various combination of bios changes based on other reddit/forum threads have said over the years.  Still no luck.\n\nSo here I am.\n\nSpecs:\n\nMB: MSI z270 Tomahawk\nCPU: Intel I7-7700K\nGPU: AMD 6800XT\nRAM: TFORCE Vulkan Z 3200MHZ\n\nIf any of you have any ideas on how to remedy my situation, that would be awesome.

Games I play range from older games to indie to some AAA titles like KCD2/CIV/BF6 \n\n  \nI would rather spend extra $ up front now and have a high end rig that wouldn't need replacements any time soon, than having to update parts within the next few years.\n\nI'm in Australia btw.\n\n  \nThanks in advance\n\n\\[PCPartPicker Part List\\](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/BBvVjn)\n\n\n\nType|Item|Price\n\n:----|:----|:----\n\n\\*\\*CPU\\*\\* | \\[AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.2 GHz 8-Core Processor\\](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/3hyH99/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-42-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100000910wof) | $598.00 @ BPC Technology \n\n\\*\\*CPU Cooler\\*\\* | \\[Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler\\](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/hYxRsY/thermalright-peerless-assassin-120-se-6617-cfm-cpu-cooler-pa120-se-d3) | $55.00 @ PCCaseGear \n\n\\*\\*Motherboard\\*\\* | \\[Asus TUF GAMING B650E-E WIFI ATX AM5 Motherboard\\](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/K8XMnQ/asus-tuf-gaming-b650e-e-wifi-atx-am5-motherboard-tuf-gaming-b650e-e-wifi) | $269.00 @ Centre Com \n\n\\*\\*Memory\\*\\* | \\[Crucial Pro Overclocking 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL36 Memory\\](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/QF9wrH/crucial-pro-overclocking-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl36-memory-cp2k16g60c36u5b) | $179.82 @ Amazon Australia \n\n\\*\\*Storage\\*\\* | \\[TEAMGROUP MP44L 1 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive\\](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/2x4Ycf/teamgroup-mp44l-1-tb-m2-2280-pcie-40-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-tm8fpk001t0c101) | $145.99 @ Amazon Australia \n\n\\*\\*Video Card\\*\\* | \\[Sapphire PULSE Radeon RX 9070 XT 16 GB Video Card\\](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/Bvjv6h/sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-9070-xt-16-gb-video-card-11348-03-20g) | $1095.00 @ Amazon Australia \n\n\\*\\*Case\\*\\* | \\[Phanteks XT PRO ATX Mid Tower Case\\](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/zJWJ7P/phanteks-xt-pro-atx-mid-tower-case-ph-xt523p1-bk01) | $89.00 @ PCCaseGear \n\n\\*\\*Power Supply\\*\\* | \\[Silverstone DA750R-GMA 750 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply\\](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/KxjRsY/silverstone-da750r-gma-750-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-sst-da750r-gma) | $119.00 @ Centre Com \n\n\\*\\*Keyboard\\*\\* | \\[Corsair K70 RGB PRO Wired Gaming Keyboard\\](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/ctBG3C/corsair-k70-rgb-pro-wired-gaming-keyboard-ch-9109410-na) | $209.00 @ Centre Com \n\n | \\*Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts\\* |\n\n | \\*\\*Total\\*\\* | \\*\\*$2759.81\\*\\*\n\n | Generated by \\[PCPartPicker\\](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2025-10-25 11:33 AEDT+1100 |  \n",

Nothing. \n\n4) Attempt to update BIOS via q-flash.  Appears to work but at the end the PC shuts off and suddenly the power button does nothing.   \n\n5) Pull it apart and see some shiny spots on mobo socket - Not sure if I bent pins, or tightned the arctic down too much or what.   Return MOBO.  \n\n  \n6) Get new mobo today and go through all these steps again.  Another gigabyte board.  Update to newest bios before installing anything. \n\n7) CPU and Dram led diagnoistc lights alternating flashing.  \n\n8) Pull cpu and see a similar shiny spot in the socket. \n\n  \nFrustratd I put my old system back together with its thermalright contact frame and noctua cooler.

I'm not new to pc's or building them but I helped my friend build his first one last year and as of ~6 months ago he's been having crashes. \n\nHes been having a couple different ones: hypervisor, and another windows 11 security one. Also, he has a galahad 2 cooler with l connect 3 installed, and randomly his game will black screen, the cpu screen will freeze, go black, come back on and then be frozen at whatever temps and percents it was showing before. \n\nHe got force updated to windows 11 a few months ago. I think its when the crashing started. He started getting hypervisor crashes and random BSODs, which let me to believe that possibly 11 was killing his pc so he randomly bought a new mobo. Before we swapped it yesterday, about a week ago we tried our best to turn off anything hypervisor related but it didn't stop any of the crashing. I figured it wouldn't hurt so we swapped boards and I reinstalled 10 on it and hes been doing fine now for a few days, but the cpu freezing keeps occurring. Im possibly thinking its a bad L connect version? My first thought at the start was possibly too much power draw cause his pc sits at around 700w consumption and his psu is 850 but im not totally sure.

I've been at this for at least 3 hours now and I'm just over it.

Only off details I notice are a red light on the motherboard and RGB lights that stay on after the computer is shut off.\n\nall computer parts: https://www.newegg.com/m/tools/custom-pc-builder/ld?dln=32314458\nvideo of inside pc: https://imgur.com/a/Hmpy5a9",

I think its when the crashing started. He started getting hypervisor crashes and random BSODs, which let me to believe that possibly 11 was killing his pc so he randomly bought a new mobo.

I figured it wouldn't hurt so we swapped boards and I reinstalled 10 on it and hes been doing fine now for a few days, but the cpu freezing keeps occurring. Im possibly thinking its a bad L connect version?

Let me know!\n\nIn saying that -\nI could go cheaper on the case and get 2TB of m.2 but I want a good case and airflow and plenty of room for cable management. There is cheaper RAM but this is going to do the CPU justice. \n\nSolid PSU, solid gpu without spending an arm and a leg, WD sn850x is top notch, I feel like this build should be cheaper for the same exact (if not, negligible) performance AND quality though.

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie’s Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

You can prove me wrong 😀\n\nGameplay consists of simple first person point-and-click mechanics. Where it stands out is interactivity. Environment is carefully hand-crafted with attention to detail, from the architecture of the buildings all the way down to the flushing sounds in the toilet.\n\nThe estimated length of the game is roughly 2 hours i would say. The length of the game depends on how fast you solve the puzzles. Some of them might be slightly on the more difficult side of the spectrum since they are a little bit unconventional.\n\n**Main features**\n\n* **Atmospheric first-person** mystery with light point-and-click style interactions.  \n* **Highly interactive environments** \\- almost everything reacts: drawers, switches, computers, instruments, sauna, etc.  \n* **Environmental storytelling**: newspapers, phones, and tiny props that hide clues.  \n* **Puzzles** that skew a bit **unconventional** \\- some are simple, a few are “huh… wait” moments by design.  \n\nBuilt to reward **curiosity** and **note-taking** rather than brute forcing.",

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

Jeanette and Therese, the haunted house quest, damn it was good.\nThis feeling to be a monster, powerful, free, cover by vice decafance and sensuality..and humour. \n\nSo yeah, I knew VTM: Bloodlines 2 wouldn’t be great but a part of be wish they gat at least the atmosphere, the \" cool\" factor! ...well They dint and it turned out to be a disappointment. I was ready to play something less open-world, more action-driven, without the full open world and multi-gameplay style of the first.\n\nWhen I started the game, I had a little bit of hope... until they showed me the skill sheet and I realized how simple it was. I became... sad.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, it just doesn’t have a soul. It’s boring. The voice acting for every character, including the main one, is dull and lifeless, with no energy or personality. It lacks the sensuality, the vice, the dirtiness that made the first game unforgettable. The game feels too clean, like the studio didn’t want to take any risks. The female Nomad is boring as hell. Fabian the Malkavian is slightly less boring, but still not entertaining. And he’s a freaking Malkavian!\n\nThe controls are stiff, the combat is dull (I chose Tremere, maybe that was a mistake), and the game is full of bugs. The music... well, it’s somewhere? But when it plays, it completely lacks that epic gothic techno vibe from the first game.\n\nThat said, I do like the graphic style. It looks good. There’s something there, something that could make a great game if they knew what to do with it.\n\nI really hope this isn’t the last game of the series. I want a third one, something that lets them finally make a good game. I hope they listen to the community’s feedback and run with it.\n",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

Too afraid to alienate players and make big swings like the setting deserves.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nexus Hub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus-hub)** - [Andrew Logue](https://opencritic.com/critic/3996/andrew-logue) - [8 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves if it ain’t broke, make it bigger and prettier - a solid sequel that expands upon the first game in meaningful ways, though some fans might experience a bit of déjà vu.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Vincent Ternida](https://opencritic.com/critic/8412/vincent-ternida) - [8 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a title well worth exploring, offering accessible gameplay and thoughtful quality-of-life enhancements that cater to both newcomers and returning fans. While it doesn’t radically reinvent the formula, it delivers a satisfying action RPG experience that scratches the adventure itch and rewards players who engage with its missions in full.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PPE.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/642/ppe-pl)** - [Patryk Dzięglewicz](https://opencritic.com/critic/8235/patryk-dzi-glewicz) - *Polish* - [8 / 10](https://www.ppe.pl/recenzje/387599/the-outer-worlds-2-recenzja-gry-chciwosc-kontra-totalitaryzm.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 may not revolutionize what we saw in the first installment, but it significantly improves on familiar elements. If you're in the mood for a great space opera with a satirical twist and RPG elements, you should definitely give this shooter a try.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pizza Fria](https://opencritic.com/outlet/915/pizza-fria)** - [Leandro Felippe de Paiva Gomes](https://opencritic.com/critic/10798/leandro-felippe-de-paiva-gomes) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://pizzafria.ig.com.br/analises/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 manages to captivate with its charismatic cast of characters, a world that truly rewards exploration, and a good variety of approaches and choices that generate real consequences in the player's journey.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Timothy Nunes](https://opencritic.com/critic/846/timothy-nunes) - [9 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-ps5/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 excels on almost all fronts, presenting you with an open RPG that lets you choose how you progress while still keeping you on a clear path. The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie’s Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

It is still enabled in the settings, but it does not have any effect, wich I can see visually and through the NVIDIA Overlay, because the FPS doesnt increase, i just have the Base FPS and Base Performance.\n\nI have a Ryzen 5 7500F and a RTX 5070 on Windows 11 Home. I tried enabling DLSS, disabling DLSS, enabling DLAA, enabling FSR or TSR or XeSS, or switching betwenn DLSS modes like performance and such with no effect, only the Base Performance is there. I also tried enabling and disabling NVIDIA Reflex, didnt help.\n\nI also tried deleting the DLSS and Shader Cache of NVIDIA in DXCache and GLCache, replacing the nvngx\\_dlss.dll in the game folder with the newest from [https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-dlss-dll](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-dlss-dll), restarting both the game and windows a ton, deactivating and activating Hardware Accelerated GPU Planning with Restarts everytime and deinstalling all NVIDIA Drivers with DDU and then reinstalling them, all of these did not help.\n\nI did not try today, but back when i had the same Problem with Expedition 33 to use DLSS Override, wich did not help either. The problem occured in Total in Hitman 3, Expedition 33, Control and STalker 2, so i dont think its a Problem of the DLSS implementation. Eventually, in Expedition 33 howewer, i enabled it and it seemed to work again, but i have no reliable way to replicate that.\n\nI dont know if related, but Framegen seems to work.\n\nI am really desperate because this is not a single case but in every game i try enabling DLSS, i hope someone can help!\n\n  \n",

So my poor, little SSD is just being used to cache the main hard drive.\n\nAnyway, I wonder what happens when it dies in this configuration? It's still working. I just happened to find it at 1% or perhaps it just says this until it actually dies.\n\nThe original drive was rated for only 75 TBW and I calculate 139 TBW using the raw data.",

    "selftext": "I’m dealing with a really weird issue and I honestly don’t know what’s going on. A while ago I turned off my PC like normal, went to sleep, and the next day when I turned it on, I noticed temps were rising like crazy.\n\nI tried a few things, unplugged and replugged some cables, then took off the AIO cooler and checked the thermal paste. It wasn’t the worst, but it looked a bit dry. So I cleaned it and put new thermal paste on. After that, everything worked great for like six or seven days.\n\nIt was totally fine all day Saturday, I was gaming and coding, just using it pretty heavily. Temps were completely normal. Then I went to sleep for a couple of hours, woke up around midnight, turned it on again and boom, the same exact issue came back. Fans spinning fine, pump says it’s running, but temps just keep rising and don’t stop. Water temp hits like 75°C, and the CPU goes way up, maybe even 100 or 150°C, not sure because it just keeps going up nonstop.\n\nIt’s the same thing that happened the first time. The system was working fine all day, then the issue started right after a restart or waking from sleep. I even reapplied thermal paste a second time this time around, but that didn’t fix it either.\n\nIt’s just so weird because it runs totally fine for a full day, then after I shut it down or let it sleep for a few hours, it wakes up with this overheating problem. The fans are running, the pump shows RPM, but the temps don’t stop climbing.\n\nAt this point I really don’t know what the problem is. Could be the AIO, could be something else, but it’s just not making sense. If anyone has seen anything like this or has any ideas, I’d really appreciate the help.\n\nThanks.",

The person I got them from put them into the boxes of what I assume are the new parts they replaced their old parts with, and I can’t contact the person in question to ask for the details on the old parts for the foreseeable future so I have to rely on looking at the parts themselves to ID them. The psu I’m relatively sure is some version of a Cooler Master V850 SFX based on the print on it and the size of the unit, though I can’t see any date on it so I wouldn’t know how old it is or if it’s a refresh or something. The aio fits inside the packaging for a 280 but I’m not convinced it’s not a 240 just because I haven’t yet found something that looks like exactly like it on Cooler Master’s website- most everything I’ve seen there has been 240s or 360s. However I’m just having a lot more trouble with it because it doesn’t have any labels printed on it besides a Cooler Master   logo on the cpu block and a text label on the side of radiator. \n\nCan anyone tell me if my guess on the psu is right, and what the aio is? \n\nEdit: Also just realized the fans with the aio don't seem to have come with it. Arctic fans of some sort? Could use some help with them also. Image added in comments. ",

    "selftext": "Earlier today I was playing a game in windowed mode when suddenly everything turned into what you see in the first image. (Aside from the black box in the middle which was me turning my monitor off and on again in disbelief.) I had no choice but to force shut down the computer and see what happens if I turned it back on and that's how the second image came to be. It would function normally for 10 seconds and then turn to mush. I haven't changed any settings or anything and this all happened out of nowhere.\n\nAfter consulting some friends and researching more, I figured it was just a driver issue, so I got it into safe mode and it worked perfectly fine, and I was able to uninstall the old driver, and after restarting, it worked perfectly fine until I reinstalled drivers, then it would wig out again. I've tried current drivers, old drivers, all that. It would all lead to this once the drivers were installed. I tried using DDU to really get rid of any bad drivers but it seemed to do nothing of note. It works fine in safe mode and whenever it doesn't have the nvidia drivers, but outside of that, it's no good. After tinkering more, something weird happens where it'll do the mushy stuff, and then go white and then black and then back to normal, then it will turn to mush after 10 seconds and it'll continue to do that until I log in.\n\nI'm open to trying just about anything. The gpu is an rtx 4070ti super, and it's been in my system for about 2 weeks now and worked flawlessly up until now. I don't think I have a warranty, but returning it for a loss is an option. \n\nApologies for my dirty monitor, I'm trying my best.. ",

I went to a gaming cafe recently and they had same specs and they were getting 300+ fps on valorant.. and I am shocked now as to what wrong is with my pc   \nI know that ram is not matching my MB and CPU specs, can you folks help with possible suggestions as to what can be done here ? shall I get a new ram stick or get another stick of same ram and make it dual channel or any other suggestion that can help me gain more fps ?  \nThanks",

But the only other thread I can find was from 11 years ago. \n\nWhat I'm aiming to be able to do is: Play a console in a window on my pc by hooking it up through HDMI. I know about capture cards but from what I've read they have a lot of latency due to being geared for recording. \n\nWhy the weird route? I want to be able to use my pc at the same time, I want to be able to use my headset instead of investing in a speaker set, and I don't care to invest in a tv when I have a monitor.  ",

The MB on that PC took a crap so built this one using some of those parts 😅) \n850w PSU \n64gb ram (I edit content on this PC as well and it helps)\n\nJust picked up a 1440p monitor and uhh, 3060 is struggling running JDM Drift Master at high/ultra even with DLSS, barely scratching 50fps and 1% lows dipping into the high 30s.\n\nCPU is not best for games due to the G variant, but tbh I barely see it pass 30% load running this game.\n\nSo I’m thinking GPU bottleneck’d at 1440p with high/ultra settings, so I’m at a weird fork in the road.\n\nGet a current gen GPU (leaning towards 9070XT) and run it on this AM4 machine or go all in on an AM5 build?\n\nI want to play other games as well with max settings at 1440p, don’t really want to get a used card since prices don’t seem to be worth it.\n\nI’m also open to considering a 9070 instead since the 9060xt seems to be a lateral move at 1440p.\n\nIncluded a pic because, it ain’t much but at least it looks cool lol.\n\nThanks in advance.",

So that was unexpected but there goes that ig.\n\nSo i’m planing on building a PC like in a month.And i have a low budget like 450-500 bucks.I’m from Sri Lanka btw.So currently i’m thinking about getting a Z490 motherboard paired with like a i7 10th gen and 32gigs or DDR4 if it’s in the budget or i’m gonna stick with 16.And i’m thinking about getting a old GTX 1070 or a 1080 for now and after a couple months maybe switching to a 3070.Everything is going to be second hand and i also considered going for a ryzen cpu but i couldn’t find any for good prices and the selection was very limited.Also i’m gonna need to get a monitor and a keyboard too but i have separate 170-200 USD budgets for those(Do mention if you have a recommendation).Do you guys have any tips about the setup , are there any better options for my budget? Advices and suggestions are appreciated. 🙂‍↕️",

Also, the on and restart switches don't work anymore, and the only way to truly power off the PC is by switching the PSU off.\n\nMy specs are the following:\n\n\\-CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7600\n\n\\-MOBO: MSI A620M-E PRO\n\n\\-RAM: Corsair vengance 6000 MHZ (currently set to 5200 MHZ) 32GB\n\nAnd what I mentioned before.\n\nThings I already tried:\n\n\\-Checking everything is properly plugged in.\n\n\\-Reinstalling graphic drivers.\n\n\\-Google my exact problem and find not much about it.\n\n\n\nIs this just a faulty PSU?

    "selftext": "TL;DR - Replacing Gtx1080ti\nNeed: More than 30FPS on 32\" QHD monitor. Want: Longevity, Future-proofing\nHave: Recently Upgraded PC - MB, CPU, RAM. Budget: 650USD (flexible)\nQueries: AMD/Nvidia? 2nd-Hand/New/Brand New?\n\nLooking for some advice on upgrading my old and tired GTX 1080 Ti 11GB. I've had it for nearly 8 years and it's finally giving up the ghost (can only get 30FPS on Borderlands 4, unless I downscale). I'm aware that anything I buy will be a significant improvement over my 1080Ti potato.\n\nHere are my PC specs:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7600X\nMB: Gigabyte B650M PCIe 4.0 x16 Motherboard\nRAM: 32GB 5600MHz DDR5\nDISPLAY: 32\" 1440p (QHD) Curved Monitor\nPSU: Corsair 750W\nGPU: NVIDIA 1080TI 11GB \n\nThese seem to be my upgrade options:\n\n1) Buy a second-hand 3070 or 3080 (or Ti) - High risk, low cost - 5 years old already, no warranty, power hungry and warm, mining risk - I'm already asking around mates who have upgraded recently themselves.\n\n2) Buy a 5070 or 5070Ti - Price has decreased recently, has a warranty, mixed reviews online, cooler than 3080s (it gets hot in Australia) - some second hand options are available with a  warranty.\n\n3) Buy a brand new RTX 6000 series - concerned about power requirements and potential bottlenecks (PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0), high cost - seems overkill? \n\n4) Consider an AMD alternative - 9060 or 7800 XT? - Lower cost, has warranty, higher VRAM/longevity - I've been impressed with my AMD CPU after being a long time Intel fan boy, but not sure about their GPUs. I heard the loss of Raytracing and DLSS is a huge hit, despite the price difference.\n\nMy Priorities:\n\nLongevity - can I find a replacement that I can get away with another 5+ years? I've heard more VRAM is probably a better idea long term - trying to avoid the need for Mobo (PCIe 4) and PSU (700W) replacement.\n\nMid-range-ish - I'm not looking for amazing, top of the line, blow your face off, graphics. I don't mind running some games on medium, so long as I can play them on my QHD monitor  seamlessly, without obvious visual lag. \n\nGames - I mostly play Borderlands, Sea of Thieves and some Xbox Gamepass games. I don't really play any fast shooters, AAA or intensive games like GTA, BF6, COD or CS.\n\nBudget - I'd ideally like to spend less than $1000 AUD (650 USD), but if waiting a little longer and buying better is worthwhile then perfect, as I'm not in a huge rush - Black Friday Sales are coming up soon.\n\nThank you for reading, sorry for the wall of text. I look forward to any advice and recommendations you can give :D",

It is still enabled in the settings, but it does not have any effect, wich I can see visually and through the NVIDIA Overlay, because the FPS doesnt increase, i just have the Base FPS and Base Performance.\n\nI have a Ryzen 5 7500F and a RTX 5070 on Windows 11 Home. I tried enabling DLSS, disabling DLSS, enabling DLAA, enabling FSR or TSR or XeSS, or switching betwenn DLSS modes like performance and such with no effect, only the Base Performance is there. I also tried enabling and disabling NVIDIA Reflex, didnt help.\n\nI also tried deleting the DLSS and Shader Cache of NVIDIA in DXCache and GLCache, replacing the nvngx\\_dlss.dll in the game folder with the newest from [https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-dlss-dll](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-dlss-dll), restarting both the game and windows a ton, deactivating and activating Hardware Accelerated GPU Planning with Restarts everytime and deinstalling all NVIDIA Drivers with DDU and then reinstalling them, all of these did not help.\n\nI did not try today, but back when i had the same Problem with Expedition 33 to use DLSS Override, wich did not help either. The problem occured in Total in Hitman 3, Expedition 33, Control and STalker 2, so i dont think its a Problem of the DLSS implementation. Eventually, in Expedition 33 howewer, i enabled it and it seemed to work again, but i have no reliable way to replicate that.\n\nI dont know if related, but Framegen seems to work.\n\nI am really desperate because this is not a single case but in every game i try enabling DLSS, i hope someone can help!\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Earlier today I was playing a game in windowed mode when suddenly everything turned into what you see in the first image. (Aside from the black box in the middle which was me turning my monitor off and on again in disbelief.) I had no choice but to force shut down the computer and see what happens if I turned it back on and that's how the second image came to be. It would function normally for 10 seconds and then turn to mush. I haven't changed any settings or anything and this all happened out of nowhere.\n\nAfter consulting some friends and researching more, I figured it was just a driver issue, so I got it into safe mode and it worked perfectly fine, and I was able to uninstall the old driver, and after restarting, it worked perfectly fine until I reinstalled drivers, then it would wig out again. I've tried current drivers, old drivers, all that. It would all lead to this once the drivers were installed. I tried using DDU to really get rid of any bad drivers but it seemed to do nothing of note. It works fine in safe mode and whenever it doesn't have the nvidia drivers, but outside of that, it's no good. After tinkering more, something weird happens where it'll do the mushy stuff, and then go white and then black and then back to normal, then it will turn to mush after 10 seconds and it'll continue to do that until I log in.\n\nI'm open to trying just about anything. The gpu is an rtx 4070ti super, and it's been in my system for about 2 weeks now and worked flawlessly up until now. I don't think I have a warranty, but returning it for a loss is an option. \n\nApologies for my dirty monitor, I'm trying my best.. ",

    "selftext": "TL;DR - Replacing Gtx1080ti\nNeed: More than 30FPS on 32\" QHD monitor. Want: Longevity, Future-proofing\nHave: Recently Upgraded PC - MB, CPU, RAM. Budget: 650USD (flexible)\nQueries: AMD/Nvidia? 2nd-Hand/New/Brand New?\n\nLooking for some advice on upgrading my old and tired GTX 1080 Ti 11GB. I've had it for nearly 8 years and it's finally giving up the ghost (can only get 30FPS on Borderlands 4, unless I downscale). I'm aware that anything I buy will be a significant improvement over my 1080Ti potato.\n\nHere are my PC specs:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7600X\nMB: Gigabyte B650M PCIe 4.0 x16 Motherboard\nRAM: 32GB 5600MHz DDR5\nDISPLAY: 32\" 1440p (QHD) Curved Monitor\nPSU: Corsair 750W\nGPU: NVIDIA 1080TI 11GB \n\nThese seem to be my upgrade options:\n\n1) Buy a second-hand 3070 or 3080 (or Ti) - High risk, low cost - 5 years old already, no warranty, power hungry and warm, mining risk - I'm already asking around mates who have upgraded recently themselves.\n\n2) Buy a 5070 or 5070Ti - Price has decreased recently, has a warranty, mixed reviews online, cooler than 3080s (it gets hot in Australia) - some second hand options are available with a  warranty.\n\n3) Buy a brand new RTX 6000 series - concerned about power requirements and potential bottlenecks (PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0), high cost - seems overkill? \n\n4) Consider an AMD alternative - 9060 or 7800 XT? - Lower cost, has warranty, higher VRAM/longevity - I've been impressed with my AMD CPU after being a long time Intel fan boy, but not sure about their GPUs. I heard the loss of Raytracing and DLSS is a huge hit, despite the price difference.\n\nMy Priorities:\n\nLongevity - can I find a replacement that I can get away with another 5+ years? I've heard more VRAM is probably a better idea long term - trying to avoid the need for Mobo (PCIe 4) and PSU (700W) replacement.\n\nMid-range-ish - I'm not looking for amazing, top of the line, blow your face off, graphics. I don't mind running some games on medium, so long as I can play them on my QHD monitor  seamlessly, without obvious visual lag. \n\nGames - I mostly play Borderlands, Sea of Thieves and some Xbox Gamepass games. I don't really play any fast shooters, AAA or intensive games like GTA, BF6, COD or CS.\n\nBudget - I'd ideally like to spend less than $1000 AUD (650 USD), but if waiting a little longer and buying better is worthwhile then perfect, as I'm not in a huge rush - Black Friday Sales are coming up soon.\n\nThank you for reading, sorry for the wall of text. I look forward to any advice and recommendations you can give :D",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

I am planning on moving the replicator out of sight, as well as the cables! I teach remotely so the landscape monitor is touch screen on a pivot stand. Portrait side monitor works great! \nI am looking at getting a bigger desk (this one is a bit tatty now anyway) so I can put my speakers on here, as I also use this space to play guitar/write music. Likely will getting an electric standing desk. \nIt feels a bit flat to me. Any advice for how to make the space a bit more inspiring? I’m thinking I need plants! \n\n",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Found bigger silicone bumpons that dont sink into deskpads completely, fixing “thudding”. input parts number 107091 into [Here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/), order a reasonable amount and should deliver it to you for free\n\n\nNowadays I’ve been noticing that some keyboards like the Frog Mini and some if the newer Neo boards having issues with how it sounds. This is mostly due to those keyboards having pretty short feet leading to the bottom of the keyboard to touch your deskpad as it compresses due to the weight of the keyboard which causes it to “thud”. \n\nI’ve had issues with this in the past since I use a XSoft mousepad from LethalGamingGear. When i put my keyboard on my mousepad it at first sounds fine, but as the keyboard starts to sink down due to its weight, i start to hear vibrations and “thudding” from the desk.\n\nWhile building a drawer from ikea, i noticed that it came with some silicone bumpons to reduce the noise from the contact of the wood. And now compared to the normal hemisphere silicone bumpons that keyboards usually come with, these are a bit bigger. So I thought to try them on a keyboard that is thudding, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, tall enough so that the bottom does not touch my mousepad. I did some searching to see where i can find more of these and lo and behold, ikea actually gives them for free. Simply go to the [IKEA spare parts](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/) website and input part number 107091 and it should show up. Each one comes in a pack of 2 so as long as you order a reasonable amount, they should give them to you for free delivered straight to you.\n\nEDIT: Size for comparison.

    "selftext": "About a year or two ago, I released the [ScottoFrog (Handwired Edition)](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/macropads/scottofrog-handwired-macropad) which is a completely free-to-build 3D printed macropad based on the [Frogpad](http://frogpad.com). It has the option to be either a single-handed keyboard or a normal macropad, I specifically use my copy of the board for gaming. It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB. That said, this is the [PCB Edition](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-pcb-kit) which is available on my shop if people are interested, in addition to the keycaps and 3D printed case. You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

In the heart of this eerie silence, a strange house suddenly glows with warm orange light pouring from its windows, while the grinning pumpkin at the gate seems to whisper, beckoning lost souls to draw closer.\n\nThat’s Night of Howls Cherry Art’s special Halloween keycap, crafted to celebrate this year’s spooky season.\n\nEvery detail is meticulously recreated: the swirling purple sky, gnarled tree branches, the haunted house, and the glowing jack o' lantern all blending to create an atmosphere that’s both chilling and captivating.\n\n💡 Special Lighting Effects:\n\nUnder normal light, the keycap appears as a classic Halloween painting in mystical purple and orange tones dark, moody, and irresistibly alluring.\n\nUnder UV light, magic unfolds: the house blazes to life, windows ignite like flames burn within, and the pumpkin’s grin glows with ghostly delight as if the spirit of Halloween has just awakened from a long slumber.\n\nAfter UV light fades, the keycap returns to stillness: the haunted house sinks into deep shadow, yet the windows still burn bright, inviting you to step inside. The night sky stirs with faint, ethereal glows like restless souls rising to drift across the midnight heavens.\n\nThank you all so much for always supporting and standing by the team!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n● Link Raffle [https://zfrmz.com/tOT8niK8WuocbdyfXGhl](https://zfrmz.com/tOT8niK8WuocbdyfXGhl)\n\n● Link Image [https://photos.app.goo.gl/hhNATc2yNgq4yNMK7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/hhNATc2yNgq4yNMK7)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nArtisan Keycap Detail\n\n● Sculpt: Blank Art\n\n● Name: Night of Howls\n\n● Price for sale: $100/1 Keycap \n\n● Quantity: 5 Keycaps/ Colorway\n\n● Stem type: Cherry MX\n\n● All keycaps are cast multi layer colors resin 100%\n\n● The set includes: 1 box, 1 user manual, 1 ID card and 1 Night of Howls Keycap. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nRaffle info\n\n● Raffle will be opened within 12 hours and when Raffle closes, the winner will receive an invoice via mail within 1 hours and will have 24 hours to pay \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFollow Craftkey as:\n\nInstagram: [https://www.instagram.com/craftkey/](https://www.instagram.com/craftkey/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/Craftkeycap](https://www.facebook.com/Craftkeycap)\n\nWebsite: [https://www.craftkeyartisan.com/](https://www.craftkeyartisan.com/)\n\nDiscor: [https://discord.gg/k9B7eTV4HS](https://discord.gg/k9B7eTV4HS)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I am currently rearranging my desk and I wanted to share my three keyboards! All are connected to my PC at the same time (don’t ask) and I just grab one depending on what I’m doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn’t want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I’m done!! 😊\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

    "selftext": "\n\nA flat typing surface is not very comfortable. Most keyboards solve this problem by using profiled keycaps that form the general shape of a curve. However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws:  \n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

    "selftext": "My first mechanical keyboard was an aluminum NK65 into which I popped Zilents, but it soon became a closet board (and then I left it at my childhood home for when I visit the ‘rents and work from here). Since I’ve bought a couple ai03 boards, a Neo Ergo, a Rama U-80B, a couple Jacky Hippos, and the Classic TKL. The latter most really shocked me with how good it felt and sounded at the price point. I also stocked up on Gateron Oil Kings because of all the praise and was really shocked at how great they feel out of the box without added lube.\n\nAnyways, this week I’ve been back home and I’m miserable typing on the NK65. Everything feels and sounds bad. Maybe it’s because I’m a linear man now, and obviously I’m typing on better quality boards at home, but it’s also revelatory to me just how much progress has been made, on switch quality, on stabilizers, on affordable boards. I’m probably going to buy another Classic TKL to leave here and retire/ewaste my old NK alu boards (I have the 80% one also).\n\nCurious if others have found themselves having to type on their first boards from years back and what that experience was like. It has been very very hard for me to revert.",

I was hoping for the black edition but was out of stock so it's understandable.\n\nI been using 60% and 75% keyboards for 3 years now and overall this big keyboard felt a bit weird at first but then became second nature after 1 or 2 hours. Not to mention it feels smooth to type (using it to type this post RN lol) and it's not that loud, has that \"THOCK\" sound that some are never endlessly looking for.\n\nThe RGB feels okay, wish it was more \"shine through\" (this could be fixed with some shine through keycaps) and it feels okay, have not set it up that much but overall I like it, not intrusive like others.\n\nLooks and feel: 9.5/10\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn8a2p8vfowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c0d3fe5999a988e455883a0f382b130c05a124\n\n  \nThis keyboard has a TON of features, starting with the little screen \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wflohgblowf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4432d2d43d32bcbeff9208a1c4ca89358224d92d\n\nFully customizable and guess what? You don't need an additional driver/software on your PC for yet another keyboard, this one can be used via browser (I think only on Google Chrome) but that's a FANTASTIC advantage, you can use it on Linux and Mac without sacrificing the software or customization of the keys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yps8hhyklowf1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fbd0e74884beee989f1b7b101b883bf279171b9\n\nKudos to Chiikey for this, this is a fantastic feature and something to praise, also it was incredibly easy to just post a gif to the little screen instead of having to cut the gif into multiple images and upload them all like other keyboards\n\nSoftware/Drivers 11/10\n\nAs for the unboxing process it was pretty standard and actually a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nFor starters you do not get any fancy tools to remove the keycaps or the mechanical switches itself, still no clear indication if it's hot swappable 3 or 5 pins (still yet to tear it down, wanted to test it out of the box with no modifications or me removing parts of it) it IS hot swappable but there's no really a lot of transparency of how many pins or what switches are supported.\n\nYou don't get any additional switches unlike other keyboards (some only bring 3 but at least they bring them unlike this one) there's the tab for the compartment where you can store things and also you get some screws, some plastic... tabs? and a little black thing that I am yet to recognize at the time of writing.\n\nAnd of course, you get a USB cable to charge or connect your keyboard, type C so no worries there.\n\nThe USB dongle is inside the keyboard on the bottom part hidden in a tiny\n\nThe packaging was impeccable, very beautiful box and the keyboard was very well wrapped and protected, no dents or scratches and it wasn't all over the place, all neatly packaged in a big rectangular box.\n\nUnboxing and contents: 5/10 \n\nAs mentioned before the switches on this keyboard make a very satisfying \"THOCK\" \"THOCK\" sound, it's not clear if this is lubed but it really feels good, really really good, not that loud too just \"right\"\n\nIt doesn't strain my hands as far as I tested it (around 5 or 6 hours in total, more than enough for someone who works at an office and is constantly typing non stop, even now typing this review lol)\n\nMy only complaint is that no matter what I did, the knob click behaviour never changed when I changed it in the software, it always defaults to \"mute\" instead of \"pause\" or play.\n\nTyping experience 8.5/10\n\nTotal score: 10 + 9.5 + 11 + 5 + 8.5 / 5 = 8.8/10 \n\nPersonal score being honest would be more of a 9/10, it's a pretty darn good keyboard and worth every penny, my only grip is the lack of switches or tools to customize the keyboard to your heart's content and the color, really wish it could have been the dark colored version but that's something I will learn to live with.\n\nCheers!",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/osqvzf04zpwf1.jpg?width=1840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934d86fd6b2611ac9c1986eb8209ea86c09bf7b4\n\nA quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "title": "Finally releasing the ScottoFrog (PCB Edition)",
    "selftext": "About a year or two ago, I released the [ScottoFrog (Handwired Edition)](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/macropads/scottofrog-handwired-macropad) which is a completely free-to-build 3D printed macropad based on the [Frogpad](http://frogpad.com). It has the option to be either a single-handed keyboard or a normal macropad, I specifically use my copy of the board for gaming. It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB. That said, this is the [PCB Edition](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-pcb-kit) which is available on my shop if people are interested, in addition to the keycaps and 3D printed case. You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Found bigger silicone bumpons that dont sink into deskpads completely, fixing “thudding”. input parts number 107091 into [Here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/), order a reasonable amount and should deliver it to you for free\n\n\nNowadays I’ve been noticing that some keyboards like the Frog Mini and some if the newer Neo boards having issues with how it sounds. This is mostly due to those keyboards having pretty short feet leading to the bottom of the keyboard to touch your deskpad as it compresses due to the weight of the keyboard which causes it to “thud”. \n\nI’ve had issues with this in the past since I use a XSoft mousepad from LethalGamingGear. When i put my keyboard on my mousepad it at first sounds fine, but as the keyboard starts to sink down due to its weight, i start to hear vibrations and “thudding” from the desk.\n\nWhile building a drawer from ikea, i noticed that it came with some silicone bumpons to reduce the noise from the contact of the wood. And now compared to the normal hemisphere silicone bumpons that keyboards usually come with, these are a bit bigger. So I thought to try them on a keyboard that is thudding, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, tall enough so that the bottom does not touch my mousepad. I did some searching to see where i can find more of these and lo and behold, ikea actually gives them for free. Simply go to the [IKEA spare parts](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/) website and input part number 107091 and it should show up. Each one comes in a pack of 2 so as long as you order a reasonable amount, they should give them to you for free delivered straight to you.\n\nEDIT: Size for comparison. Smaller original feet are from a JJW Moment https://imgur.com/a/T48CUmH",

This is the capstone piece to my McLaren/Gulf sim racing rig. Every morning this week I’ve been admiring them in the morning sun. This is my first ever experience with SA profile, which I was somewhat worried about but turned out to be really compatible with my hands and typing habits. I’m an 80s baby so the thick typewriter style of SA felt oddly familiar as I definitely played with vintage typewriters and word processors. \n\nBoard is a Massdrop CTRL V1 with HMX Gulf switches. ",

All are connected to my PC at the same time (don’t ask) and I just grab one depending on what I’m doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn’t want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I’m done!! 😊\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws:  \n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "title": "Finally releasing the ScottoFrog (PCB Edition)",
    "selftext": "About a year or two ago, I released the [ScottoFrog (Handwired Edition)](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/macropads/scottofrog-handwired-macropad) which is a completely free-to-build 3D printed macropad based on the [Frogpad](http://frogpad.com). It has the option to be either a single-handed keyboard or a normal macropad, I specifically use my copy of the board for gaming. It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB. That said, this is the [PCB Edition](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-pcb-kit) which is available on my shop if people are interested, in addition to the keycaps and 3D printed case. You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

OLED is out of the question because I don't want to deal with the inevitable burn in that gives a hard limit to the monitor's lifespan. That leaves IPS, and whether it comes with Mini-LED backlighting or not. \n\nAs of now, I'm not really bothered by \"black isn't really black\" but more the... dynamic range? In some games lots of details seem lost to crushed blacks and clipped highlights. When I turn on HDR the details come back but the colors look kind of wonky, especially in the Windows environment.\n\nWill appreciate feedback from anyone who has experience with the difference between regular IPS and Mini-LED/OLED in not-pitch-black room settings!",

    "selftext": "I’m currently making a project and my main concern is latency as it uses yolov8 and i’ve spent alot of time on making the model very efficient, so i got a capture card with 8-12ms latency, but it doesn’t support 144hz, i also don’t want to get a 144hz card cause the model will work at around 45-50 fps and the hefty pricetag.\n\nNow i would like to be able to use the monitor at 144hz but i need to duplicate the signal to the capture card which can’t process 144hz so windows will automatically send 60hz to both.\n\nI have looked at EDID emulators but they dont input 144hz and output 60, ive looked at the software program CRU but this would also make windows attempt to send 144hz to the capturecard, which i don’t know if it will cause damage to the card if i attempt this.\n\nDoes anyone know of any way to input 144 hertz and convert it to 60 outside of windows like an downscaler of sorts so the capture card would receive 60fps and the main monitor 144.\n\nSo far the only way i have found to be able to do this is trough OBS Projector but this would add obs encoding and capture latency along with projector output latency and increasing cpu and gpu usage, if there would be an hardware solution like this said “downscaler” it would save alot of latency and resources.\n\nIve done so much research and havent found a solution that doesn’t break the bank \n\nThanks in advance!",

GPU is 5090.\n\nInformation are gathered from Asus website, DisplaySpec, and Panelook so may not be 100% accurate...but would appreciate the input if anyone know more about these two monitors\n\n**PG32UQXR:**\n\nUsing AUO M320QAN02.8, panel spec list 99% AdobeRGB, 5ms GTG. Fully aware that it has 50% of the LED zones compared to UQX but that's ok for my use.\n\nHDMI 2.1 and DP 2.1, which is a big plus compared to UGX, however I'm not sure if the DP2.1 on the PG32UQXR is DP40 or DP80. \n\nDisplaySpec states that it can only do 8bit color at 160hz and 8bit+FRC at 120hz, but could not find much information about this else where. I think even at DP40 bandwidth it should be able to do 10bit 120hz so not sure what is the deal with this.\n\n**PG32UQX:**\n\nAlso AUO panel, slightly older revision M320QAN02.6, panel spec shows 12ms GTG, and higher zones and HDR rating.\n\nDP1.4 DSC and HDMI 2.0, but somehow DisplaySpec shows it can do 10bit at 120hz or lower, which doesn't make sense to me from bandwidth perspective given the UQXR have much higher bandwidth with both DP and HDMI.\n\nGsync Ultimate, not sure if the hardware Gsync is worth it, heard it could get annoying since there is a small fan there just to cool the Gsync hardware chip.\n\n  \nGiven that I don't need the best HDR, and don't care much for Gsync Ultimate, I'm leaning toward the UQXR given that it's $300 lower than UQX right now, but the 8bit at 160hz thing is the most puzzling to me",

The model of the monitor is KTC (120hz) and it’s working pretty well but I’m starting to think that something is a bit off. So, since the monitor itself it’s connected with the laptop (60 hz) I was wondering if there will be any impact on the performance since the laptop is 60hz and the monitor is 120hz. Also I’m unable to access the OSD because the monitor doesn’t have arrows on the back and when I try to move into the OSD ( I can open it ) I just can’t, because using the arrows of the laptop just moves the cursor from application to application on my desktop. Is there any way to solve this? The only real issue is that I want to modify some settings in the OSD and I just can’t because of this. Also I wanted to ask: is there something I should check? Something regarding the Hz difference the refresh rate or something else?? Sorry if I’m this stupid but I never used a monitor paired with a laptop (trough HDMI) so I don’t really know what to do.",

I'm looking for:\n\n* 24 - 30 inches\n* at least 2K resolution (apple has been treating me too well i cant go with lower resolution)\n* 120 - 180 hz\n* white\n* budget: under or around $500 CAD after tax (like around 350 USD i guess)\n* prefer gaming brands like ROG or MSI (dont mind me im just stubborn)\n\nI really think the Apple studio display is almost everything im looking for except its too expensive and only has a 60 hz refresh rate. Any recommendation? TIA",

I'll spend more than 12 hours a day with the monitor so it has to be very comfortable, good color, low blue light, crisp text, etc.\n\n\\- Compatible with Macbook Pro.

Do you have any other ideas or fixes you’ve tried that worked?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Salut la communauté,\n​J'ai une grosse hésitation entre deux moniteurs 4K 160 Hz de MSI et j'espère que vos retours d'expérience sur le double écran pourront m'aider à trancher.\n\n​Mon Contexte :\n\nJe joue pas mal à des jeux solo immersifs (en ce moment, Hogwarts Legacy, donc j'apprécie l'ambiance et les scènes sombres) et aussi à de la simulation automobile. Mon écran principal sera ce 32 pouces, et je l'utiliserai à côté de mon écran secondaire qui est un 27 pouces PLAT et IPS.\n\n​Mes deux finalistes (4K 160 Hz / DisplayHDR 400) :\n\n​MSI MAG 322UPF Écran gaming 32 pouces UHD - dalle Rapid IPS 3840 x 2160, 160 Hz / 1ms GtG, gamut sRGB 125,7 %, design sans cadre, DisplayHDR 400 - DP 1.4a, USB Type-C (DP alt., / PD 90W), HDMI\n​Ma crainte : J'ai peur que l'écran plat soit beaucoup moins immersif pour le jeu que le modèle incurvé.\n\n​MSI MAG 321CUP Écran PC Gaming Incurvé 32\" UHD - Dalle VA 1500, 3840x2160, 160 Hz / 1 ms, 16:9, Adaptive Sync - DisplayPort 1.4a, USB Type-C (DP Alt. avec Power Delivery 15 W), HDMI 2.1 CEC\n\n​Mon Vrai Dilemme :\n\n​Le 321CUP (VA Incurvé) me fait de l'œil pour l'immersion. MAIS : Je crains que le mettre côte à côte avec mon 27\" plat IPS ne soit très moche (décalage physique) et distrayant (incohérence des couleurs/contraste entre le VA et l'IPS).\n​Question simple : Est-ce que le gain d'immersion dans un jeu comme Hogwarts Legacy (avec l'incurvé VA) vaut le sacrifice de l'harmonie et de l'ergonomie de mon bureau (avec le 27\" plat IPS à côté) ?\n​Merci pour vos conseils avisés ! Je suis preneur de tout témoignage sur l'usage d'un écran incurvé et d'un plat sur le même bureau.",

I know that this is on the low end of the HDR cert. but I’m wondering what my best approach is.\n\nI’ve already noticed that in SDR, colours look vivid and punchy, but the display itself isn’t very bright, whereas in HDR, the opposite is true. I’ve also noticed that the brighter the picture on screen, the dimmer the display gets, which slightly irks me, and I don’t want that to happen. I’ve tested SDR and HDR in Overwatch and Hogwarts: Legacy so far (those are the two games I’m playing at the moment), and OW looks really washed out in HDR, and not much brighter than SDR due to its bright nature.\n\nWhat’s my best approach in terms of HDR? Should I just leave it off and sacrifice brightness to get punchy colours, or should I enable it just to play darker games and/or when I watch HDR content? I have already calibrated it using the Windows tool. Many thanks!",

    "title": "ASUS ROG XG27AQDPG (500Hz 1440p QD-OLED) Written Review",
    "selftext": "ASUS ROG SWIFT XG27AQDPG REVIEW\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/JAbpUPTGknQ\n\nPS: I was sent this sample unit by ASUS ROG and have been testing it extensively for about two and half weeks.\n\nTL; DR: XG27AQDPG Review\n\nAesthetics: 8.5/10\n\nSemi-Glossy QD-OLED Panel: 9/10\n\nText Clarity: 8/10\n\nMotion Clarity: 10/10 (Best I’ve ever seen)\n\nMy PC Specs:\n\nGPU: ASUS ROG Astral GeForce RTX™ 5090 OC Edition\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor\n\nRAM: CORSAIR Dominator Titanium RGB DDR5 RAM 96GB\n\nSTORAGE: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280\n\nMy Background: I work in IT and I am also a content creator; I not only use my computer for work utilizing excel and Word among other IT related programs. But I also edit my own videos on my PC with Adobe Premiere as well. I play a large variety of games, everything from JRPGS, MOBAs, Third Person Shooters, Immersive Sims, FPS, Platformers and more! And one of my favorite games that I have been playing for the past 10 years is Overwatch which I have 2K+ hours and have peaked at high masters in competitive. The monitor feels like it is targeted toward competitive gamers that want a ridiculously high refresh rate display, excellent motion clarity and a gorgeous looking display.\n\nTested monitors -\n\n1440p QD-OLED: XG27AQDPG\n\n4K QD-OLED: PG32UCDM\n\nAesthetics & Stand: I really love the aesthetic of the ASUS ROG monitors. I know the hyper gamer look isn’t for everyone but I personally adore it. I love that this monitor once again has the flat stand instead of the “spider legs”. As an owner of a very large gaming mat and someone that moves his peripherals around all the time this monitor stand is perfect for my case usage. Just like always if you decide to use the backlight aura sync on the display, you will be presented with some excellent colors on the back of your display, really ideal if the back of your monitor is facing a wall.\n\n500Hz 1440p 27” QD-OLED Experience: So, first thing I would like to state is I haven’t been the owner of a 16:9 1440p monitor in almost 2 years. I did own the G9 Neo & G9 OLED at one point, but the last 1440p 16:9 I owned was the Asus PG27AQN, a 1440p 360Hz IPS display. At the time I loved it but as higher end 4K monitors started releasing I haven’t been interested in any 1440p displays again until now. I am definitely not saying a 1440p display is in anyway as sharp as a 32” or even 27” 4K display, but I think it’s sharp “enough” to say the least, especially with its specific case usage.\n\nNow to finally get to the point of why someone would get this monitor, which is the beautiful QD-OLED panel and downright ridiculous refresh rate of 500Hz. To say competitive games like Overwatch 2, Valorant, League of Legends, Rocket League and much more look absolutely ludicrous at 500Hz would be a huge understatement. The very high refresh rate, OLED motion clarity, QD-OLED vibrant color and accuracy, perfect black levels/infinite contrast, excellent picture quality all on a 1440p 27” display. In addition, with all the Asus ROG bells and whistles which consist of features like the proximity sensor, aspect control and so many other little things create in my opinion the most beautiful competitive gaming display you can experience today. Even as someone that glazes 4K 240Hz OLED monitors I highly prefer playing competitive games on XG27AQDPG over ANY OTHER DISPLAY I have ever used in my life. The level of fluidity and the crisp image is something you have to see in person to believe.\n\nText Clarity:\n\nI for sure missed the picture-perfect text clarity of a 4K display but with the PPI being 109. I had no problem reading text in games or even during regular desktop use, but just again be aware it will not be as sharp as a 4K monitor, even a 32” one which has a PPI of 138. Someone that is already used to a 27” probably won’t suffer from this issue but I did not like editing videos on a monitor this small. Regardless of resolution as someone that has been editing on 32” monitors and ultrawide displays I’m just not a fan of editing on a display so small. This isn’t the point of getting a monitor like this though and everything is still more then legible but I just wanted you’ll to be aware of my opinion on this.\n\nMotion clarity: Something as simple as reloading a gun in Overwatch 2 is overwhelming seeing in motion at 500Hz. The culmination of specs on this monitor is legitimately insane, so much so that playing competitive games on this monitor is somehow even more “beautiful” then when playing on 4K 240Hz. Which doesn’t really make sense since it’s a lower resolution but smoothness of the image almost makes the game feel more lifelike if that makes sense. I don’t feel like we will get to the point of displays being indistinguishable from real life until we hit that 700Hz+ point. But then again what truly makes this monitor so special is that in addition to having the very high refresh rate is it also looks freaking outstanding because it’s a QD-OLED display.\n\nTesting Of Competitive Games: So, I found that quite a few games were able to hit 500Hz even at max settings. But most were still able to hit it after tinkering with some settings even if it wasn’t able to consistently stay at above 500Hz (there were outliers though sadly). Now remember to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nCompetitive Games Experience\n\nOverwatch 2 Max Settings: 300-400 FPS\n\nOverwatch 2 Tinkered Settings 400-550 FPS\n\nRocket League: Max Settings 700+ FPS\n\nCSGO 2 Max & Tinkered Settings 300-400 FPS (Nothing I did got the fps close to 500 ☹)\n\nValorant: Max Settings 500-700 FPS\n\nLeague Of Legends Max or Tinkered Settings: 500+ FPS consistently\n\nMarvel Rivals Disclaimer Now this is a special case because this game is ridiculously CPU heavy with so many CPU calculations going one with things like Dr Strange portal. I was able to get like 300+ fps with only DLSS enabled raytracing off or on, and with frame gen like 350+. But playing with frame gen is kind of counterproductive to a competitive game so I recommend not using more than 2X MFG if anything.\n\nMarvel Rivals Max Settings DLSS With Ray Tracing: 250+\n\nMarvel Rivals: DLSS Without Ray Tracing 325+ FPS\n\nMarvel Rivals: Frame Gen Without/Without Ray Tracing 350+ FPS\n\nTesting of Non-Competitive Games\n\nSo, these next few games are games that I not only love playing but also showcasing on my channel when I am testing and doing showcases. But do take into account that to reach the 500fps threshold or even get close a mix of DLSS and Multi Frame Gen had to be used on some titles. But with none of these games being competitive, ridiculously low input lag isn’t necessarily needed (Arc Raiders & Big Maybe BF6 might be exceptions). And in my honest opinion what makes this monitor so darn special is you can dial up all the settings to max and get at least 150+ fps in like ever title. Or if the game is not demanding at all or with the help of DLSS and or Frame Gen, games that you wouldn’t even think would be able to even touch close to 500Hz had very surprising results. I tested more games but this gives you a gist of the performance you can get with different non-competitive titles. Remember again to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nNon-Competitive Games\n\nDoom Eternal: Max Settings with Ray Tracing 275-325 FPS\n\nDoom Eternal: Medium Settings & No Raytracing: 400-500 FPS\n\nHollow Knight: 800 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Max Settings, DLAA & Raytracing: 75-95 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Medium Settings DLSS Balanced with MFG 3X 250-300…4X: 330-375 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Low Settings DLSS Ultra Performance with MFG 4X 400-455 FPS\n\nReturnal: Max Settings No DLSS 150-212 FPS (Even with enabling just DLSS Quality-Ultra Performance there was no FPS increase)\n\nReturnal: Max Settings DLSS Quality & Frame Gen 325-375 FPS (Switching to other DLSS methods didn’t change framerate for me most likely because of the 5090 lol)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing No Frame Gen Enabled & Path Tracing 59-62 FPS (This might seem super low but being able to run this game natively at any resolution and get above 60 fps is really impressive. This is one of the most demanding games of all time!)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 90-100 FPS.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 100+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 150+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 190+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 200-350 FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 200+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 360+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 230+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 425+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Performance, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 450+ FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing, DLAA No Frame Gen: 140-150 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 2X: 240-270 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 3X: 325-340 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Medium Settings/Low Raytracing DLSS Ultra Performance Frame Gen 4X: 480-500 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & No Frame Gen 70-95 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 130-150 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 190-215 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4X 240-277 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 350-375 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 375-440 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4x 475-525 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA No Frame Gen 150-175 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 2X 250+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 3X 380+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 2X 344-380 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 3X 430-450 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 4X 500-540 FPS\n\nAsus Monitor Features: Firstly, the response time is 0.03ms if frame gen was not enabled every single movement of the mouse felt instantaneous unlike any other monitor I’ve used. In addition, you also have OLED Anti Flicker 2.0 which to my knowledge is an exclusive feature to ASUS monitors. In addition, the monitor comes equipped ELMB (BFI) which does a good job of removing motion blur on their displays I will be honest though you’re not really seeing much blur at 500Hz anyway. But when playing lower refresh rate titles, it is definitely an amazing feature. The Proximity Sensor is also amazing and is just one of the handful of tools that come in ASUS OLED CARE PRO. Which does a really job of slowing down the process of burn in on the display. The 3 Year warranty is great and ASUS DisplayWidget Center which also you to tinker with your monitor settings right on the desktop is Stellar. Lastly, I would like to state that with this monitor being HDR500 over HDR400 like found on previous OLED displays you can expect a overall brighter image and it is very pleasant.\n\nAspect Control Mode: Now this is probably one of the coolest features on ASUS monitors today but it works the best on here than I have ever seen on any display ever. To my knowledge this is the only 500Hz 1440p QD-OLED monitor that is capable of doing this with only tinkering in Nvidia Control Panel or the AMD equivalent and not using a thirds party program (which still doesn’t support the full 1440p resolution). But this monitor can do full 2560x1440 500Hz in its 24.5 inch mode and my goodness it is glorious. Being able to play at that resolution on a 500Hz 25” QD-OLED display is god-like. I definitely get the hoopla of playing competitive games at that size and being able to do it with the crazy specs of this display really makes for a fantastic experience.\n\nAt this moment in time this is easily the best looking competitive gaming monitor when it comes to fidelity, motion, refresh rate and colors. The Tandem variant is supposed to release later this year and if you prioritize oily black levels, a brighter image (540Hz on the higher tier model) and then also the 720p 720Hz dual mode that variant might be more ideal for you. But if you are fine with 500Hz (which is more then enough LOL) and a more vibrant monitor in color and realistic picture because of the QD-OLED Panel the XG27AQDPG might be the perfect monitor for you. I had ridiculously high expectations for this display and it still blew me away!\n\nOverall Score: 9.6/10",

(Would do it again). \n\nThe image quality 8.8/10. Yes it's not an OLED but this thing sure gives any matte OLED display a run for its money. I was actually going to buy the new Gigabyte MO27Q28G Tandem WOLED monitor however ultimately I was not prepared to buy disposable tech which burns in as I do a lot of productivity work. But compared to some matte OLED's I have seen this monitor is pretty damn close.\n\nLocal Dimming 8.5/10. Haloing is imperceptible to my eye. I can see some very minor blooming but to be totally honest I think most people are not gonna see it unless they look for it (Note I use this monitor with the Local Dimming set to Level 3). I don't mind loosing some details to get better blacks. \n\nGhosting would be a solid 9/10. There is some ghosting as per what I saw on the UFO test however to my eyes it's not a big deal and I don't notice it anyways and I would suspect that most people won't notice it anyways.\n\nThe panel is VERY responsive, I don't see slow reaction times. I run the display on the second fastest overdrive settings (out of box). \n\nI did notice something funny. HDR refused to work at 300Hz in Windows and the display wouldn't be detected as a HDR display unless I cracked it down to 240Hz. This is also on the latest FW update.\n\n\n\n",

It's a shame, they are more fragile than regular glass.\n\nI filed a complaint the day I received the package, within about two hours. I immediately wrote to the complaints department and the next day they called me with an apology and information that they would send a courier.\n\nThe courier arrived about a week later and took the package away. After four days, the complaint was acknowledged and the money was returned to my account.\n\nSo overall, I didn't lose anything, and I must say that the process was quick and without complications. Such things should be dealt with immediately, not waiting and then regretting it.\n\nThis was my first experience with a complaint and it turned out surprisingly well. I was quite shocked and anxious when I saw the cracked display.",

I'm quite sensitive to judder when the refresh rate does not match or is not a multiple of the framerate:\n\n* When watching 30p, 60i or 60p video I keep my monitor set to 60 Hz (good for North American and other formerly NTSC 60 Hz country's content, plus videos recorded on people's phones)\n* When watching 25p, 50i or 50p video I set my monitor to 50 Hz (typical as I live in Europe where everything is filmed and broadcasted for 50 Hz)\n* When watching 24p content I set my monitor to a custom 48 Hz and also experimented with a 72 Hz custom setting - lovely\n\nThe above settings make all video playback very enjoyable. I don't like looking at the judder of a 25p panning shot on a 60 Hz monitor and love having no judder when playing 24p at a refresh rate that is a multiple of 24.\n\n**Time to modernise**\n\nI have been upgrading my tech recently (no more Haswell-based system as I've build an AM5-based PC) and I am preparing to get into UHD gaming (likely with the help of FSR upscaling with the RX 9070 XT I have ordered). I have a few questions as I have never owned a high refresh monitor or one with a variable refresh rate (well, besides my new laptop with a range or 40 - 60 Hz VRR).\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. I'm looking at a 4K gaming monitor (LG 27GR93U) as the main monitor but I imagine these questions and answers apply to many models of monitors - it is a 144 Hz panel with VRR (48 - 144 Hz). I would like to default my Windows desktop to 120 Hz for ease of watching 24p, 30p and 60p content judder-free by default. Can I set the desktop resolution VRR range to be 48 - 120 Hz out of the box? \\*Judder-free video playback is more important to me than seeing more than 120 fps in video games. If this isn't commonly available, I might default to VRR off unless I'm gaming.\n2. When I want to watch 25p or 50p video content I'd like to manually set the screen to a 50 Hz (2\\*25, 1\\*50) or 100 Hz refresh rate (not 75 Hz as that's only good for 25p playback at 3\\*25, not 50p at 1.5\\*50). The manual to nearly every high refresh rate monitor I've looked at do not list 50 Hz and 100 Hz unless it is specifically a 100 Hz 1080p monitor. **May I kindly ask if some of you reading could check if your modern high refresh rate monitors have 50 Hz and 100 Hz options available within your Windows or GPU driver settings?** I would really appreciate it.\n3. I'm looking at getting a 1080p monitor as a second screen - one with HDCP 2.2 compliance like the LG 27GR93U has (looking at the Dell SE2425HG 1080p 200 Hz monitor). I have already seen that it supports 120 Hz so that is good for switching between 200 Hz when watching 25p (8\\*25) and 50p (4\\*50) content and 120 Hz for 24p (5\\*24), 30p (4\\*30) and 60p (2\\*60). **I've seen other 1080p monitors with weird refresh rates like 165 Hz** (bad for all video playback) **and 180 Hz** (only good for 30p and 60p playback). **If you have a monitor with these refresh rates, do you also have 120 Hz, 100 Hz and 50 Hz options? I'd love to know.**\n\n\\*Note: by judder-free I do not mean motion interpolation also known as TruMotion (LG), MotionFlow (Sony), Picture Clarity or Auto Motion Plus (Samsung) etc. I detest motion interpolation.\n\n**Final notes**\n\nI don't see too many people ask these questions online on other forums through Google searching and those who do rarely got good or knowledgeable answers. Many dismiss the OP's concerns, thinking that the higher the refresh rate, the better no matter what it is. Some have no idea about how mis-matching video content with framerate causes judder. 3:2 pulldown should be a term everyone knows but apparently not. If you have a look at your refresh rate options in your high refresh rate UHD monitor settings I'd be very grateful and more confident in what I buy. \n\nI encourage responses from as many people with as many different monitor models as available.\n\nWith Quick Media Switching limited to full screen video signals on UHD TVs (QMS), I hope that for PC monitors we'll see 2160p 600 Hz monitors one day (600 is the lowest common multiple for 24, 25, 30, 50 and 60). I don't care enough about 48p films to wish for a native 2160p 1200 Hz monitor.\n\nThank you.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m currently trying to decide on a new monitor and I’m really torn between a 34\" ultrawide OLED and a 32\" 4K OLED. This will be my daily driver, but my main focus is gaming. I mostly play single-player games, though I do jump into multiplayer occasionally, but nothing competitive.\n\nI’m upgrading from a dual 27\" setup, so either choice would be a pretty noticeable change. My PC has a 4080 Super paired with a 7800X3D, so running 4K isn’t a problem. What I’m trying to figure out is whether I’d get more immersive experiences from the extra width of a 34\" ultrawide or the extra height of a 32\" 4K.\n\nIf anyone has experience with both or has a similar setup, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

(Would do it again). \n\nThe image quality 8.8/10. Yes it's not an OLED but this thing sure gives any matte OLED display a run for its money. I was actually going to buy the new Gigabyte MO27Q28G Tandem WOLED monitor however ultimately I was not prepared to buy disposable tech which burns in as I do a lot of productivity work. But compared to some matte OLED's I have seen this monitor is pretty damn close.\n\nLocal Dimming 8.5/10. Haloing is imperceptible to my eye. I can see some very minor blooming but to be totally honest I think most people are not gonna see it unless they look for it (Note I use this monitor with the Local Dimming set to Level 3). I don't mind loosing some details to get better blacks. \n\nGhosting would be a solid 9/10. There is some ghosting as per what I saw on the UFO test however to my eyes it's not a big deal and I don't notice it anyways and I would suspect that most people won't notice it anyways.\n\nThe panel is VERY responsive, I don't see slow reaction times. I run the display on the second fastest overdrive settings (out of box). \n\nI did notice something funny. HDR refused to work at 300Hz in Windows and the display wouldn't be detected as a HDR display unless I cracked it down to 240Hz. This is also on the latest FW update.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "ASUS ROG XG27AQDPG (500Hz 1440p QD-OLED) Written Review",
    "selftext": "ASUS ROG SWIFT XG27AQDPG REVIEW\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/JAbpUPTGknQ\n\nPS: I was sent this sample unit by ASUS ROG and have been testing it extensively for about two and half weeks.\n\nTL; DR: XG27AQDPG Review\n\nAesthetics: 8.5/10\n\nSemi-Glossy QD-OLED Panel: 9/10\n\nText Clarity: 8/10\n\nMotion Clarity: 10/10 (Best I’ve ever seen)\n\nMy PC Specs:\n\nGPU: ASUS ROG Astral GeForce RTX™ 5090 OC Edition\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor\n\nRAM: CORSAIR Dominator Titanium RGB DDR5 RAM 96GB\n\nSTORAGE: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280\n\nMy Background: I work in IT and I am also a content creator; I not only use my computer for work utilizing excel and Word among other IT related programs. But I also edit my own videos on my PC with Adobe Premiere as well. I play a large variety of games, everything from JRPGS, MOBAs, Third Person Shooters, Immersive Sims, FPS, Platformers and more! And one of my favorite games that I have been playing for the past 10 years is Overwatch which I have 2K+ hours and have peaked at high masters in competitive. The monitor feels like it is targeted toward competitive gamers that want a ridiculously high refresh rate display, excellent motion clarity and a gorgeous looking display.\n\nTested monitors -\n\n1440p QD-OLED: XG27AQDPG\n\n4K QD-OLED: PG32UCDM\n\nAesthetics & Stand: I really love the aesthetic of the ASUS ROG monitors. I know the hyper gamer look isn’t for everyone but I personally adore it. I love that this monitor once again has the flat stand instead of the “spider legs”. As an owner of a very large gaming mat and someone that moves his peripherals around all the time this monitor stand is perfect for my case usage. Just like always if you decide to use the backlight aura sync on the display, you will be presented with some excellent colors on the back of your display, really ideal if the back of your monitor is facing a wall.\n\n500Hz 1440p 27” QD-OLED Experience: So, first thing I would like to state is I haven’t been the owner of a 16:9 1440p monitor in almost 2 years. I did own the G9 Neo & G9 OLED at one point, but the last 1440p 16:9 I owned was the Asus PG27AQN, a 1440p 360Hz IPS display. At the time I loved it but as higher end 4K monitors started releasing I haven’t been interested in any 1440p displays again until now. I am definitely not saying a 1440p display is in anyway as sharp as a 32” or even 27” 4K display, but I think it’s sharp “enough” to say the least, especially with its specific case usage.\n\nNow to finally get to the point of why someone would get this monitor, which is the beautiful QD-OLED panel and downright ridiculous refresh rate of 500Hz. To say competitive games like Overwatch 2, Valorant, League of Legends, Rocket League and much more look absolutely ludicrous at 500Hz would be a huge understatement. The very high refresh rate, OLED motion clarity, QD-OLED vibrant color and accuracy, perfect black levels/infinite contrast, excellent picture quality all on a 1440p 27” display. In addition, with all the Asus ROG bells and whistles which consist of features like the proximity sensor, aspect control and so many other little things create in my opinion the most beautiful competitive gaming display you can experience today. Even as someone that glazes 4K 240Hz OLED monitors I highly prefer playing competitive games on XG27AQDPG over ANY OTHER DISPLAY I have ever used in my life. The level of fluidity and the crisp image is something you have to see in person to believe.\n\nText Clarity:\n\nI for sure missed the picture-perfect text clarity of a 4K display but with the PPI being 109. I had no problem reading text in games or even during regular desktop use, but just again be aware it will not be as sharp as a 4K monitor, even a 32” one which has a PPI of 138. Someone that is already used to a 27” probably won’t suffer from this issue but I did not like editing videos on a monitor this small. Regardless of resolution as someone that has been editing on 32” monitors and ultrawide displays I’m just not a fan of editing on a display so small. This isn’t the point of getting a monitor like this though and everything is still more then legible but I just wanted you’ll to be aware of my opinion on this.\n\nMotion clarity: Something as simple as reloading a gun in Overwatch 2 is overwhelming seeing in motion at 500Hz. The culmination of specs on this monitor is legitimately insane, so much so that playing competitive games on this monitor is somehow even more “beautiful” then when playing on 4K 240Hz. Which doesn’t really make sense since it’s a lower resolution but smoothness of the image almost makes the game feel more lifelike if that makes sense. I don’t feel like we will get to the point of displays being indistinguishable from real life until we hit that 700Hz+ point. But then again what truly makes this monitor so special is that in addition to having the very high refresh rate is it also looks freaking outstanding because it’s a QD-OLED display.\n\nTesting Of Competitive Games: So, I found that quite a few games were able to hit 500Hz even at max settings. But most were still able to hit it after tinkering with some settings even if it wasn’t able to consistently stay at above 500Hz (there were outliers though sadly). Now remember to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nCompetitive Games Experience\n\nOverwatch 2 Max Settings: 300-400 FPS\n\nOverwatch 2 Tinkered Settings 400-550 FPS\n\nRocket League: Max Settings 700+ FPS\n\nCSGO 2 Max & Tinkered Settings 300-400 FPS (Nothing I did got the fps close to 500 ☹)\n\nValorant: Max Settings 500-700 FPS\n\nLeague Of Legends Max or Tinkered Settings: 500+ FPS consistently\n\nMarvel Rivals Disclaimer Now this is a special case because this game is ridiculously CPU heavy with so many CPU calculations going one with things like Dr Strange portal. I was able to get like 300+ fps with only DLSS enabled raytracing off or on, and with frame gen like 350+. But playing with frame gen is kind of counterproductive to a competitive game so I recommend not using more than 2X MFG if anything.\n\nMarvel Rivals Max Settings DLSS With Ray Tracing: 250+\n\nMarvel Rivals: DLSS Without Ray Tracing 325+ FPS\n\nMarvel Rivals: Frame Gen Without/Without Ray Tracing 350+ FPS\n\nTesting of Non-Competitive Games\n\nSo, these next few games are games that I not only love playing but also showcasing on my channel when I am testing and doing showcases. But do take into account that to reach the 500fps threshold or even get close a mix of DLSS and Multi Frame Gen had to be used on some titles. But with none of these games being competitive, ridiculously low input lag isn’t necessarily needed (Arc Raiders & Big Maybe BF6 might be exceptions). And in my honest opinion what makes this monitor so darn special is you can dial up all the settings to max and get at least 150+ fps in like ever title. Or if the game is not demanding at all or with the help of DLSS and or Frame Gen, games that you wouldn’t even think would be able to even touch close to 500Hz had very surprising results. I tested more games but this gives you a gist of the performance you can get with different non-competitive titles. Remember again to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nNon-Competitive Games\n\nDoom Eternal: Max Settings with Ray Tracing 275-325 FPS\n\nDoom Eternal: Medium Settings & No Raytracing: 400-500 FPS\n\nHollow Knight: 800 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Max Settings, DLAA & Raytracing: 75-95 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Medium Settings DLSS Balanced with MFG 3X 250-300…4X: 330-375 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Low Settings DLSS Ultra Performance with MFG 4X 400-455 FPS\n\nReturnal: Max Settings No DLSS 150-212 FPS (Even with enabling just DLSS Quality-Ultra Performance there was no FPS increase)\n\nReturnal: Max Settings DLSS Quality & Frame Gen 325-375 FPS (Switching to other DLSS methods didn’t change framerate for me most likely because of the 5090 lol)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing No Frame Gen Enabled & Path Tracing 59-62 FPS (This might seem super low but being able to run this game natively at any resolution and get above 60 fps is really impressive. This is one of the most demanding games of all time!)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 90-100 FPS.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 100+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 150+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 190+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 200-350 FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 200+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 360+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 230+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 425+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Performance, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 450+ FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing, DLAA No Frame Gen: 140-150 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 2X: 240-270 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 3X: 325-340 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Medium Settings/Low Raytracing DLSS Ultra Performance Frame Gen 4X: 480-500 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & No Frame Gen 70-95 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 130-150 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 190-215 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4X 240-277 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 350-375 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 375-440 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4x 475-525 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA No Frame Gen 150-175 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 2X 250+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 3X 380+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 2X 344-380 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 3X 430-450 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 4X 500-540 FPS\n\nAsus Monitor Features: Firstly, the response time is 0.03ms if frame gen was not enabled every single movement of the mouse felt instantaneous unlike any other monitor I’ve used. In addition, you also have OLED Anti Flicker 2.0 which to my knowledge is an exclusive feature to ASUS monitors. In addition, the monitor comes equipped ELMB (BFI) which does a good job of removing motion blur on their displays I will be honest though you’re not really seeing much blur at 500Hz anyway. But when playing lower refresh rate titles, it is definitely an amazing feature. The Proximity Sensor is also amazing and is just one of the handful of tools that come in ASUS OLED CARE PRO. Which does a really job of slowing down the process of burn in on the display. The 3 Year warranty is great and ASUS DisplayWidget Center which also you to tinker with your monitor settings right on the desktop is Stellar. Lastly, I would like to state that with this monitor being HDR500 over HDR400 like found on previous OLED displays you can expect a overall brighter image and it is very pleasant.\n\nAspect Control Mode: Now this is probably one of the coolest features on ASUS monitors today but it works the best on here than I have ever seen on any display ever. To my knowledge this is the only 500Hz 1440p QD-OLED monitor that is capable of doing this with only tinkering in Nvidia Control Panel or the AMD equivalent and not using a thirds party program (which still doesn’t support the full 1440p resolution). But this monitor can do full 2560x1440 500Hz in its 24.5 inch mode and my goodness it is glorious. Being able to play at that resolution on a 500Hz 25” QD-OLED display is god-like. I definitely get the hoopla of playing competitive games at that size and being able to do it with the crazy specs of this display really makes for a fantastic experience.\n\nAt this moment in time this is easily the best looking competitive gaming monitor when it comes to fidelity, motion, refresh rate and colors. The Tandem variant is supposed to release later this year and if you prioritize oily black levels, a brighter image (540Hz on the higher tier model) and then also the 720p 720Hz dual mode that variant might be more ideal for you. But if you are fine with 500Hz (which is more then enough LOL) and a more vibrant monitor in color and realistic picture because of the QD-OLED Panel the XG27AQDPG might be the perfect monitor for you. I had ridiculously high expectations for this display and it still blew me away!\n\nOverall Score: 9.6/10",

I was wondering how much of a overkill is it to get a 2k MSI monitor (MAG 275QF). Now, my pc specs are pretty lame but I need a good monitor while I save little by little to get a replacement for my current gpu that is a 1060 3gb.  \nPD: the MAG 275QF is 220$. Those are the prices in this banana republic so I gotta stick to them.[](https://es.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-275QF)[](https://es.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-275QF)",

Interestingly on my android tablet (Samsung s9 ultra) over usb C it will use HDR no problem, blacks are truly black and all is well, so whats the issue on windows? is Windows 10 just that shit for HDR and upgrading to 11 might remedy the issues?

It's been >5 years since I last bought bought any new hardware for my (old) gaming PC and I'm totally overwhelmed by what is available and I don't even want to start. The is only one thing i'm certain about:\n\nI want to have a 2 monitor setup. I guess curved screens are out of the game because of that? My current screens have 28\" and that's a good size (happy with a little smaller or bigger though).\n\nI currently run two ASUS TUF Gaming VG289Q1A and i'm incredibly unhappy with them. The Display port has been broken 3 times on each monitor since i bought them 5 years ago. I installed each monitor once and never even wiggled the cable and the port randomly stopped working. So my trust in ASUS monitors is pretty much gone. If you think there is no alternative to ASUS I might bite the bullet though.\n\nHappy for any kind of assistance how to get closer to a decent choice. Thanks!\n\n  \nEdit answering open questions:\n\n\\- Budget: Nothing fixed, not convinced to spend 1000 a monitor. <500€ ideally  \n\\- use case: Gaming  \n\\- setup: 2 identical monitors, running game on one and netflix/discord/reddit on the other  \n\\- GPU: haven't bought the new system but will be around RTX5080",

    "selftext": "Doing some research on high refresh rate IPS with wide color gamut, a lot of good options are no longer available but the two Asus options are still available for purchase in the US. GPU is 5090.\n\nInformation are gathered from Asus website, DisplaySpec, and Panelook so may not be 100% accurate...but would appreciate the input if anyone know more about these two monitors\n\n**PG32UQXR:**\n\nUsing AUO M320QAN02.8, panel spec list 99% AdobeRGB, 5ms GTG. Fully aware that it has 50% of the LED zones compared to UQX but that's ok for my use.\n\nHDMI 2.1 and DP 2.1, which is a big plus compared to UGX, however I'm not sure if the DP2.1 on the PG32UQXR is DP40 or DP80. \n\nDisplaySpec states that it can only do 8bit color at 160hz and 8bit+FRC at 120hz, but could not find much information about this else where. I think even at DP40 bandwidth it should be able to do 10bit 120hz so not sure what is the deal with this.\n\n**PG32UQX:**\n\nAlso AUO panel, slightly older revision M320QAN02.6, panel spec shows 12ms GTG, and higher zones and HDR rating.\n\nDP1.4 DSC and HDMI 2.0, but somehow DisplaySpec shows it can do 10bit at 120hz or lower, which doesn't make sense to me from bandwidth perspective given the UQXR have much higher bandwidth with both DP and HDMI.\n\nGsync Ultimate, not sure if the hardware Gsync is worth it, heard it could get annoying since there is a small fan there just to cool the Gsync hardware chip.\n\n  \nGiven that I don't need the best HDR, and don't care much for Gsync Ultimate, I'm leaning toward the UQXR given that it's $300 lower than UQX right now, but the 8bit at 160hz thing is the most puzzling to me",

    "selftext": "So, I bought a new monitor for gaming but since my computer is broken I’m playing with a laptop and it will be like this for like 4-5 months. The model of the monitor is KTC (120hz) and it’s working pretty well but I’m starting to think that something is a bit off. So, since the monitor itself it’s connected with the laptop (60 hz) I was wondering if there will be any impact on the performance since the laptop is 60hz and the monitor is 120hz. Also I’m unable to access the OSD because the monitor doesn’t have arrows on the back and when I try to move into the OSD ( I can open it ) I just can’t, because using the arrows of the laptop just moves the cursor from application to application on my desktop. Is there any way to solve this? The only real issue is that I want to modify some settings in the OSD and I just can’t because of this. Also I wanted to ask: is there something I should check? Something regarding the Hz difference the refresh rate or something else?? Sorry if I’m this stupid but I never used a monitor paired with a laptop (trough HDMI) so I don’t really know what to do.",

OLED is out of the question because I don't want to deal with the inevitable burn in that gives a hard limit to the monitor's lifespan. That leaves IPS, and whether it comes with Mini-LED backlighting or not. \n\nAs of now, I'm not really bothered by \"black isn't really black\" but more the... dynamic range? In some games lots of details seem lost to crushed blacks and clipped highlights. When I turn on HDR the details come back but the colors look kind of wonky, especially in the Windows environment.\n\nWill appreciate feedback from anyone who has experience with the difference between regular IPS and Mini-LED/OLED in not-pitch-black room settings!",

(Would do it again). \n\nThe image quality 8.8/10. Yes it's not an OLED but this thing sure gives any matte OLED display a run for its money. I was actually going to buy the new Gigabyte MO27Q28G Tandem WOLED monitor however ultimately I was not prepared to buy disposable tech which burns in as I do a lot of productivity work. But compared to some matte OLED's I have seen this monitor is pretty damn close.\n\nLocal Dimming 8.5/10. Haloing is imperceptible to my eye. I can see some very minor blooming but to be totally honest I think most people are not gonna see it unless they look for it (Note I use this monitor with the Local Dimming set to Level 3). I don't mind loosing some details to get better blacks. \n\nGhosting would be a solid 9/10. There is some ghosting as per what I saw on the UFO test however to my eyes it's not a big deal and I don't notice it anyways and I would suspect that most people won't notice it anyways.\n\nThe panel is VERY responsive, I don't see slow reaction times. I run the display on the second fastest overdrive settings (out of box). \n\nI did notice something funny. HDR refused to work at 300Hz in Windows and the display wouldn't be detected as a HDR display unless I cracked it down to 240Hz. This is also on the latest FW update.\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "ASUS ROG SWIFT XG27AQDPG REVIEW\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/JAbpUPTGknQ\n\nPS: I was sent this sample unit by ASUS ROG and have been testing it extensively for about two and half weeks.\n\nTL; DR: XG27AQDPG Review\n\nAesthetics: 8.5/10\n\nSemi-Glossy QD-OLED Panel: 9/10\n\nText Clarity: 8/10\n\nMotion Clarity: 10/10 (Best I’ve ever seen)\n\nMy PC Specs:\n\nGPU: ASUS ROG Astral GeForce RTX™ 5090 OC Edition\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor\n\nRAM: CORSAIR Dominator Titanium RGB DDR5 RAM 96GB\n\nSTORAGE: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280\n\nMy Background: I work in IT and I am also a content creator; I not only use my computer for work utilizing excel and Word among other IT related programs. But I also edit my own videos on my PC with Adobe Premiere as well. I play a large variety of games, everything from JRPGS, MOBAs, Third Person Shooters, Immersive Sims, FPS, Platformers and more! And one of my favorite games that I have been playing for the past 10 years is Overwatch which I have 2K+ hours and have peaked at high masters in competitive. The monitor feels like it is targeted toward competitive gamers that want a ridiculously high refresh rate display, excellent motion clarity and a gorgeous looking display.\n\nTested monitors -\n\n1440p QD-OLED: XG27AQDPG\n\n4K QD-OLED: PG32UCDM\n\nAesthetics & Stand: I really love the aesthetic of the ASUS ROG monitors. I know the hyper gamer look isn’t for everyone but I personally adore it. I love that this monitor once again has the flat stand instead of the “spider legs”. As an owner of a very large gaming mat and someone that moves his peripherals around all the time this monitor stand is perfect for my case usage. Just like always if you decide to use the backlight aura sync on the display, you will be presented with some excellent colors on the back of your display, really ideal if the back of your monitor is facing a wall.\n\n500Hz 1440p 27” QD-OLED Experience: So, first thing I would like to state is I haven’t been the owner of a 16:9 1440p monitor in almost 2 years. I did own the G9 Neo & G9 OLED at one point, but the last 1440p 16:9 I owned was the Asus PG27AQN, a 1440p 360Hz IPS display. At the time I loved it but as higher end 4K monitors started releasing I haven’t been interested in any 1440p displays again until now. I am definitely not saying a 1440p display is in anyway as sharp as a 32” or even 27” 4K display, but I think it’s sharp “enough” to say the least, especially with its specific case usage.\n\nNow to finally get to the point of why someone would get this monitor, which is the beautiful QD-OLED panel and downright ridiculous refresh rate of 500Hz. To say competitive games like Overwatch 2, Valorant, League of Legends, Rocket League and much more look absolutely ludicrous at 500Hz would be a huge understatement. The very high refresh rate, OLED motion clarity, QD-OLED vibrant color and accuracy, perfect black levels/infinite contrast, excellent picture quality all on a 1440p 27” display. In addition, with all the Asus ROG bells and whistles which consist of features like the proximity sensor, aspect control and so many other little things create in my opinion the most beautiful competitive gaming display you can experience today. Even as someone that glazes 4K 240Hz OLED monitors I highly prefer playing competitive games on XG27AQDPG over ANY OTHER DISPLAY I have ever used in my life. The level of fluidity and the crisp image is something you have to see in person to believe.\n\nText Clarity:\n\nI for sure missed the picture-perfect text clarity of a 4K display but with the PPI being 109. I had no problem reading text in games or even during regular desktop use, but just again be aware it will not be as sharp as a 4K monitor, even a 32” one which has a PPI of 138. Someone that is already used to a 27” probably won’t suffer from this issue but I did not like editing videos on a monitor this small. Regardless of resolution as someone that has been editing on 32” monitors and ultrawide displays I’m just not a fan of editing on a display so small. This isn’t the point of getting a monitor like this though and everything is still more then legible but I just wanted you’ll to be aware of my opinion on this.\n\nMotion clarity: Something as simple as reloading a gun in Overwatch 2 is overwhelming seeing in motion at 500Hz. The culmination of specs on this monitor is legitimately insane, so much so that playing competitive games on this monitor is somehow even more “beautiful” then when playing on 4K 240Hz. Which doesn’t really make sense since it’s a lower resolution but smoothness of the image almost makes the game feel more lifelike if that makes sense. I don’t feel like we will get to the point of displays being indistinguishable from real life until we hit that 700Hz+ point. But then again what truly makes this monitor so special is that in addition to having the very high refresh rate is it also looks freaking outstanding because it’s a QD-OLED display.\n\nTesting Of Competitive Games: So, I found that quite a few games were able to hit 500Hz even at max settings. But most were still able to hit it after tinkering with some settings even if it wasn’t able to consistently stay at above 500Hz (there were outliers though sadly). Now remember to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nCompetitive Games Experience\n\nOverwatch 2 Max Settings: 300-400 FPS\n\nOverwatch 2 Tinkered Settings 400-550 FPS\n\nRocket League: Max Settings 700+ FPS\n\nCSGO 2 Max & Tinkered Settings 300-400 FPS (Nothing I did got the fps close to 500 ☹)\n\nValorant: Max Settings 500-700 FPS\n\nLeague Of Legends Max or Tinkered Settings: 500+ FPS consistently\n\nMarvel Rivals Disclaimer Now this is a special case because this game is ridiculously CPU heavy with so many CPU calculations going one with things like Dr Strange portal. I was able to get like 300+ fps with only DLSS enabled raytracing off or on, and with frame gen like 350+. But playing with frame gen is kind of counterproductive to a competitive game so I recommend not using more than 2X MFG if anything.\n\nMarvel Rivals Max Settings DLSS With Ray Tracing: 250+\n\nMarvel Rivals: DLSS Without Ray Tracing 325+ FPS\n\nMarvel Rivals: Frame Gen Without/Without Ray Tracing 350+ FPS\n\nTesting of Non-Competitive Games\n\nSo, these next few games are games that I not only love playing but also showcasing on my channel when I am testing and doing showcases. But do take into account that to reach the 500fps threshold or even get close a mix of DLSS and Multi Frame Gen had to be used on some titles. But with none of these games being competitive, ridiculously low input lag isn’t necessarily needed (Arc Raiders & Big Maybe BF6 might be exceptions). And in my honest opinion what makes this monitor so darn special is you can dial up all the settings to max and get at least 150+ fps in like ever title. Or if the game is not demanding at all or with the help of DLSS and or Frame Gen, games that you wouldn’t even think would be able to even touch close to 500Hz had very surprising results. I tested more games but this gives you a gist of the performance you can get with different non-competitive titles. Remember again to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nNon-Competitive Games\n\nDoom Eternal: Max Settings with Ray Tracing 275-325 FPS\n\nDoom Eternal: Medium Settings & No Raytracing: 400-500 FPS\n\nHollow Knight: 800 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Max Settings, DLAA & Raytracing: 75-95 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Medium Settings DLSS Balanced with MFG 3X 250-300…4X: 330-375 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Low Settings DLSS Ultra Performance with MFG 4X 400-455 FPS\n\nReturnal: Max Settings No DLSS 150-212 FPS (Even with enabling just DLSS Quality-Ultra Performance there was no FPS increase)\n\nReturnal: Max Settings DLSS Quality & Frame Gen 325-375 FPS (Switching to other DLSS methods didn’t change framerate for me most likely because of the 5090 lol)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing No Frame Gen Enabled & Path Tracing 59-62 FPS (This might seem super low but being able to run this game natively at any resolution and get above 60 fps is really impressive. This is one of the most demanding games of all time!)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 90-100 FPS.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 100+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 150+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 190+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 200-350 FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 200+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 360+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 230+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 425+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Performance, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 450+ FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing, DLAA No Frame Gen: 140-150 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 2X: 240-270 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 3X: 325-340 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Medium Settings/Low Raytracing DLSS Ultra Performance Frame Gen 4X: 480-500 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & No Frame Gen 70-95 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 130-150 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 190-215 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4X 240-277 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 350-375 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 375-440 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4x 475-525 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA No Frame Gen 150-175 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 2X 250+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 3X 380+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 2X 344-380 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 3X 430-450 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 4X 500-540 FPS\n\nAsus Monitor Features: Firstly, the response time is 0.03ms if frame gen was not enabled every single movement of the mouse felt instantaneous unlike any other monitor I’ve used. In addition, you also have OLED Anti Flicker 2.0 which to my knowledge is an exclusive feature to ASUS monitors. In addition, the monitor comes equipped ELMB (BFI) which does a good job of removing motion blur on their displays I will be honest though you’re not really seeing much blur at 500Hz anyway. But when playing lower refresh rate titles, it is definitely an amazing feature. The Proximity Sensor is also amazing and is just one of the handful of tools that come in ASUS OLED CARE PRO. Which does a really job of slowing down the process of burn in on the display. The 3 Year warranty is great and ASUS DisplayWidget Center which also you to tinker with your monitor settings right on the desktop is Stellar. Lastly, I would like to state that with this monitor being HDR500 over HDR400 like found on previous OLED displays you can expect a overall brighter image and it is very pleasant.\n\nAspect Control Mode: Now this is probably one of the coolest features on ASUS monitors today but it works the best on here than I have ever seen on any display ever. To my knowledge this is the only 500Hz 1440p QD-OLED monitor that is capable of doing this with only tinkering in Nvidia Control Panel or the AMD equivalent and not using a thirds party program (which still doesn’t support the full 1440p resolution). But this monitor can do full 2560x1440 500Hz in its 24.5 inch mode and my goodness it is glorious. Being able to play at that resolution on a 500Hz 25” QD-OLED display is god-like. I definitely get the hoopla of playing competitive games at that size and being able to do it with the crazy specs of this display really makes for a fantastic experience.\n\nAt this moment in time this is easily the best looking competitive gaming monitor when it comes to fidelity, motion, refresh rate and colors. The Tandem variant is supposed to release later this year and if you prioritize oily black levels, a brighter image (540Hz on the higher tier model) and then also the 720p 720Hz dual mode that variant might be more ideal for you. But if you are fine with 500Hz (which is more then enough LOL) and a more vibrant monitor in color and realistic picture because of the QD-OLED Panel the XG27AQDPG might be the perfect monitor for you. I had ridiculously high expectations for this display and it still blew me away!\n\nOverall Score: 9.6/10",

Here's what I found:\n\nhttps://uperfect.com/products/23-inch-stacked-dual-screen\n\nhttps://www.amazon.ca/InnoView-Monitor-315%C2%B0Adjustable-Extendrer-Windows/dp/B0DS8D55Y2\n\nhttps://store.acer.com/en-sg/pd243y-e\n\nThose 3 suspiciously all look the same but I don't trust no name brands such as \"Uperfect\" and \"Innoview\", something is off\n\nhttps://www.mobilepixels.us/products/geminos\n\nFrom what I've read I should stick to IPS as they last longer and preferably something with high sRGB for truer colors while I'm using a drawing tablet.\n\nAny other suggestions?\n",

I've tried my gf's monitor and it works fine. Likewise this same monitor works fine on her pc w/the 4060. Same cable and everything. So the cable and monitor work fine.

    "selftext": "**source:** tidal or personal flac files through bluetooth aptx\n\n**FIT:**\n\nHDB 630 - very comfortable but loosest of the bunch. felt a bit insecure. if l looked up or shook my head I had that feeling they may fall off. smaller ear cups too if you're concern about that and I could feel contact with my ears but nothing uncomfortable for me.\n\nPX7 S3 - slightly more clamping force which got a little uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. best seal out of the bunch so pick your poison.\n\nPx8 S2 - most comfortable. not too tight, not too loose. just right on my head. doesn't feel insecure.\n\n**BUILD QUALITY:**\n\nHDB 630 - decent. I would expect more at this price. honestly feels a bit plasticky and cheap. style also is very bland. doesn't look premium. Also, I personally don't like the swipe touch controls and I found them finicky.\n\nPX7 S3 - excellent. no leather. great styling and premium look. I enjoy the button controls better than the Sennheiser.\n\nPx8 S2 - excellent. has leather if you're concern about that. great styling and premium look even more than the px7. same button controls as the px7.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nHDB 630 - good but not great. with airplane noise it's about the same as the Px7. 630's were better with distinct noises like voices or background noise in a cafe or on a bus.\n\nPX7 S3 - good. not great. pretty good with airplane noise but distinct noises leak through quite a bit.\n\nPx8 S2 - just okay. worst of the bunch surprisingly. let in more airplane noise than the other two and distinct sounds leaked through quite a bit like the Px7\n\n**SQ:**\n\n**HDB 630:**\n\ntuning: pretty neutral\n\nspace and technicalities: space and staging is good. not great but all three are closed back so that's a natural limitation. Sennheiser is more relaxed and less \"fun\" but some audiophiles prefer that. both the Px7 and Px8 everything sounds closer and more \"fun\". good technicalities though. everything feels snappy and controlled. instrument separation is great.\n\nbass: well extended into sub bass and well controlled but is definitely not the star of the show. a bit thin sounding if you're not used to audiophile tuning. they can rumble though if you boost the bass with the EQ\n\nmids: maybe it's the audiophile tuning but it sounds a bit shouty to me. definitely not warm. lower mids seems thin while upper mids sound too forward. vocals sound a bit thin and snares sound a little sharp. actually a bit annoying to my ears but I tend to be treble sensitive.\n\ntreble: great as you would suspect from audiophile tuning. well extended and controlled but do weirdly get harsh for me. again, I'm a bit sensitive to treble so YMMV with that.\n\n**PX7 S3:**\n\ntuning: very bloated bass. maybe you'll like it if you're a basshead. good extension into sub bass but a bit less controlled than the px8 and 630 but still pretty good.\n\nspace and technicalities: worst of the bunch but still pretty good and pleasant to the ears. I only really notice they're worse after listening to the other headphones. both the px8 and 630 extract more detail and sound more spacious and 3D.\n\nbass: way bloated. strong and good extension into sub bass\n\nmids: my favorite here actually. sounds intimate and full. smooth and fun tuning. not shouty.\n\ntreble: my favorite also. sounds well extended and airy but not overly so. doesn't get sharp or shouty. maybe a tad rolled off and recessed compared to true audiophile tuning but to my ear they are close to just right. very pleasant sounding. the treble adds a bit of nice air and sparkle without getting annoying.\n\n**Px8 S2:**\n\ntuning: I would still consider these bass bloated but less so than the px7. mids feel a tiny bit more recessed than the px7 but more present and forward than the 630. more treble presence than the px7. maybe about the same as the 630 but sounds less shouty.\n\nspace and technicalities: very good here. better 3D space and detail than the px7. bass is tighter and transients feels slightly snappier than the px7. similar to the 630 in terms of space and detail but again, the B&Ws feel closer and more \"fun\".\n\nbass: my favorite bass of the three. still sounds bloated to me but less so than the px7. more balanced and controlled than the px7. definitely way more power here than the 630 without EQing.\n\nmids: very good. tiny bit recessed compared to the px7. sounds smooth and balanced.\n\ntreble: very good here. well controlled and extended but still sounds smooth. about the same presence as the 630 but sounds more balanced to me.\n\n**what I'm keeping?**\n\nto my surprise, I think I'm keeping the Px7 S3. I'm hoping the band loosens a bit. the ANC is pretty good especially with airplane noise. the B&W styling is very attractive. mids and highs are great and tuned to my liking. sense of space and technicalities are still very good and pleasant to listen to. and for now, I have the low bass down 3.5 and mid bass down 2.0 and they sound less bloated.",

    "title": "3 year Review of the Audeze LCD-X (Post 2021 Version)",
    "selftext": "To start off, these are such incredible cans. It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

While I think the ATs beat them in imaging, it isn’t that big of a difference. They are less comfortable, don’t have any bass, build quality feels cheap. \n\nI tried them with BF6 and while it was immersive, the moment I put on the 490s after these the difference was apparent. The velour pads work well with my glasses and are way more comfortable than the audio technicas. \n\nI also tried listening to some music, namely BRAT because I love the production on that album and these lacked any sort of punch. I have SONY MDR MV1s coming in tomorrow, will see how they hold up against what I already have. Looking for something more V shaped and lush compared to the 560s sound signature and I’ve heard that the mv1s fit that description well. If they don’t I might return the 490s, R70xas and MV1s and skipping mid fi completely and move to some Hi Fi offerings like Clears/Meze 109 pro/FT7 (because I want to try planars). Any other suggestions are welcome, looking for open backs with a big soundstage as well as a bass boost. Not too concerned with neutrality. ",

I found the DT880s and DT990s too sibilant, more so with the former.\n\nInsanely comfortable. Awesome bass + sub bass (FT1 pro is better), droolworthy soundstage/imaging.\n\nI cannot believe the things I am hearing in music and while playing BF6, I can pinpoint instruments and gunshots in any direction like I'm right there. All of this and no Beyer sibilance? absolutely brilliant.\n\nThese headphones are damn near perfect for my use case while being sensitive to higher frequencies. If you dont take lightly to bright headphones give these a try!\n\n",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 - Maybe Buy 2 Headphones Instead",
    "selftext": "**TLDR:** Good sound, good customization, bad comfort, finnicky connectivity, high price. Audeze Maxwell + Momentum 4 for $50 more (can be less if you're cool with open box) do more things better.\n\n**The positives:**\n\n* **One of the best ever sounding closed backs**, definitely the best I've heard with ANC (vs Bathys, XM5/XM6, Momentum 4, QC Ultra, Airpods Max), competes with or beats many wired closed backs. I think they fall just short of Audeze Maxwell with some EQ adjustments, but those headphones are very close to my tastes out of the box so YMMV.\n* Pairs great tuning with anatomy measurements to normalize low end performance between different users and re-seating.\n* **PEQ** to dial in to your tastes\n* **Low latency** (matched my monitor's input lag near identically in gaming mode by my perception))and high res Bluetooth connections with the dongle. I think Sennheiser are getting close to or even beating that 30ms latency in the low latency dongle mode\n* **The sound with the dongle is excellent**, even in the low latency mode\n* Solid all around functionality as a portable ANC headphone\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n* **Comfort is not great**. Fairly shallow pads that compress easily cause heat and pressure on the pinna, and I don't have big ears. They (and Momentum 4) also have an odd cup angle that requires you to rotate the headband forward which is sub-optimal. For comparison, I find the Bathys comfier in the pads but slightly less comfy in the headband. I hate the XM5/XM6 comfort-wise, 630 are an improvement. APM are comfier and QC Ultra are much much comfier.\n* The WC Freeze pads for Momentum 4 fit and are way comfier but hurt the seal a lot (which makes ANC and sound both much worse) making those pads a complete no-go IMO.\n* No 2.4GHz on the dongle\n* Finicky pairing and touch controls. Same issues as Momentum 4.\n* **No ability to use the mic + get full sound quality at the same time**\n* No options for a boom mic\n* **Boring looking and no color options,** and they are a bit too thick in the cups to look normal vs other ANC.\n* **Expensive**: **You can get a pair of Momentum 4 + an Audeze Maxwell for $50 more**, and less than the price of the HDB 630 if you are willing to do refurbs/open box. Maxwell is comfier to me (weight doesn't bother me, capra strap improves even more) and sounds better + has the boom mic and low latency via 2.4ghz. Momentum 4 sounds pretty good with the built in graphic EQ and not that much worse than HDB 630 if you use another app for PEQ.\n\n**Deeper Sound Breakdown**: These headphones were very quickly determined to be not worth the money for me, so these impressions are not my most thorough. As with all sound impressions, YMMV.\n\n* **Tuning**\n   * They are **a bit mid-bass focused** for me, sounding a bit bloated in the low end. Luckily the blending into the mids is very clean and not boomy. The extension is good, but the midbass focus also reduces how apparent this is\n   * **The mids are very nice.** Perhaps a bit lacking in energy, but this can be fixed with a peak filter most likely somewhere between 1-3k. I often find 2-2.5k helps with this a lot.\n   * **They are very natural sounding in timbre**. This is the one thing that they solidly beat the Momentum 4 at even with the M4 dialed in with the in-app EQ.\n   * **The treble very even and pleasant albeit** maybe a tad too relaxed for me.\n* **Technicalities**\n   * **Bass texture is lacking.** Even with a filter reigning in the midbass, they lacked the grit and texture in the low-end that I really look for in a headphone\n   * **Treble is a bit oversmoothed, leading to a perceived lack of resolution**. This may actually be affecting the bass texture situation.\n   * **They aren't that punchy or energetic**. The midbass focus and a bit of relaxed 1-3k lead to a bit of dullness. Kick drums don't impact as nicely as I'd like, and higher voices don't come through as strongly as I think they should.\n   * **They are a well-controlled but not super 'fast'.** Especially with the bass reduced, they do give the impression of not being sloppy or slow, but they aren't super quick in terms of attack or decay.\n   * **A note about imaging/soundstage**: I am a speaker guy first and foremost. I don't get any impression of verticality or layering from any headphones unless the music is mastered specifically with headphones and spaciousness in mind. I find that production to be very rare. The things I do notice are imaging and distance. **The imaging is good; t**his is mostly just down to consistent channel matching across the FR. **Spaciousness is exactly what you'd expect.** They aren't completely inside my head, but they give no impression the sound is coming from a distance outside of the headphone. This is typical for me for closed backs.\n* **EQ Suggestions:**\n   * Peak filter around 120hz, q\\~1, -1-3db to get rid of the bass bloat\n   * If you are more of a bass roll-off fan, do a bass shelf with 2-5db reduction.\n   * Find the area between 1-3k that increasing with a q filter of \\~1 by 1-3db gives you more energy and punch.\n   * Find any over-emphasis in the low treble, 3-7k and reduce that if needed.\n   * See if you have any aggressive peaks above 5k, and reduce them with smaller q value filters\n   * Add a treble shelf to boost detail if needed.\n\n**Summary:** excellent sound especially with PEQ, mediocre comfort, boring design that looks a bit bulky on head, good latency and sound via dongle, no boom mic, sound is bad when using mic, and pricey vs a dedicated ANC + dedicated gaming headphone. I like the Maxwell + Momentum 4 enough to make it a no-go for me. **But if the mic situation and comfort are good for you, they're very hard to beat as an all-around single solution.**",

    "selftext": "i got really curious on ali express, and saw a listing for an mmcx mod for an outdated clip on headphone, the Phillips SHS4700, listed for 35cad (25usd) plus shipping. it came today, and as the title said i am surprised. i thought it would be a cheap sounding headphone, yknow like a replica of the phillips shs4700 but with mmcx like with those porta pro listings on ali express. but these aren’t half bad. just a note though, i am no audiophile but i will try to explain some thoughts of mine\n\nthe wires included are usable, but are not in any way durable. although, this isn’t bad since it’s already mmcx modded, so swapping chords is ok. mic is usable too, but not really good. it’s also usb c instead of 3.5mm\n\nclips are very uncomfortable without some adjustment, and the headphones are very small. if you have big ears, this headphone might not be for you. it’s pitifully small, and even makes my small ears look giant by comparison.\n\nin terms of sound, it’s actually usable. i’ll be using the ksc75s, as that is within the price range i paid for.\n\nin terms of sound leakage, because these are not open back, there is significantly less leakage, although it’s still there. i can probably wear these outside and not be a bother. \n\nin terms of sound quality, the headphones actually have slightly higher bass compared to the ksc75s. the treble is slightly recessed, and lacks some detail in that regard, but the mids are around the same. however, the ksc75s still offer better imaging and has a wider soundstage, probably due to the perks of having an open back design.\n\nstill, in terms of sound stage and detail, these aren’t half bad for the price. i was expecting little to no imaging whatsoever, especially from a product from ali-express.\n\nit even has detachable wires and a usable mic, which is already a plus compared to the ksc75s. with these, i don’t feel like i have to be as careful as i do with those pairs. \n\nto clarify, in terms of detail, soundstage and imaging, the ksc75s are better. however, this does have a slightly louder midbass, and i feel like i can swing this thing around my pocket without killing this thing forever. for my casual use case, i am satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Listening to them as I write this. Technically a fist impression but like I know what I'm listening for and done all my test songs so I feel confident on how I feel. They sound great, shocker right. The big thing is music just sounds correct in these. Good bass extension so still fun. Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Quick Impressions",
    "selftext": "Just got these in and wow — out of the box they sound superb. The tuning is really neutral and everything comes together seamlessly. The bass has great extension and presence — it adds solid weight and heft to the music without bleeding into the mids or muddying up vocals. Speaking of vocals, they’re insanely clear, super natural, and have that spot-on timbre Sennheiser does so well. Instruments sound very lifelike with great clarity and separation too.\n\nTreble is crisp and airy but never harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is actually excellent for a closed-back set, and imaging is really precise. Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other — everything has its space.\n\nHaven’t played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it’s nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony’s level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it’s impressive how well the ANC works — definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn’t.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn’t quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it’s not far behind — way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts — 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I’d still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I’m really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic — clean, balanced, natural — and they’re super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic — super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality’s surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

    "selftext": "That cord always ends up tangled in my pocket, a tiny knot of chaos I have to spend minutes undoing. My clumsy fingers wrestle with the plastic wire, while people with wireless earbuds would’ve already finished two songs by now. It’s been too long—its rubber coating has started to get sticky, the volume button on the controller feels jammed, and sometimes there’s a faint electric buzz in the right ear. Maybe it’s time to replace it.\n\nBut I just can’t quit that little click when I plug it into my phone.\nSo soft, yet so solid.\nLike the sound of an old door lock turning, shutting the whole world out.\n\nWalking is the worst. The wire swings across my chest, rustling against my jacket’s zipper. On the stairs I have to hold it tight, or it’ll catch on the railing. Windy days are even worse—the wire tangles in my hair and pulls hard enough to hurt. I still remember that rainy day when my best friend and I huddled under the convenience store awning. She naturally took off her right earbud and handed it to me:\n“Listen—this intro is amazing.”\nA raindrop slid down the wire into my collar, cold and sharp. We stood together in that shared ninety centimeters of space, and the warmth of her body seemed to flow through the copper line. For a moment, the rain really did feel like decoration.\n\nNow my friend wears thousand-yuan noise-cancelling headphones, walking with confidence, never worrying about tangled cords. She says technology is great—it’s freed us from the wire.\nBut I’m still using this glitchy old pair, the left side fine, the right side buzzing now and then—only working if I hold it at just the right angle. Like me, struggling in that night without an ending—broken, stuttering, unclear.\n\nYesterday on my way to class, the wire snagged on my backpack strap again. I crouched to untie the knot while the person behind me clicked their tongue in annoyance. But honestly, I kind of enjoy this clumsiness. Wireless feels too perfect—perfect like a lie. The spotless charging case, the precise touch controls, never tangled, never messy. But my life is a tangle—why should my music be perfectly ordered?\n\nThis wired earphone has been with me for nearly three years. The braided cable is pilling, the gold plating on the plug worn thin. These flaws are like folded corners in an old diary, recording every ordinary day. Of course a new pair would be better—sleek and shiny—but it doesn’t know my ears. It hasn’t heard the song I played on repeat after you left during that fight. It doesn’t know the white noise that lulled me to sleep on sleepless nights.\n\nLast month I almost replaced it. I even placed the order for the newest model—then canceled it at 3 a.m. The customer service agent asked if there was a problem with the product.\n“No,” I said. “The problem’s with me.”\n—Nostalgia is a sickness with no cure.\n\nToday, as the taxi climbed the overpass, the right ear suddenly went silent. I instinctively twisted the yellowed plug, feeling the rough edge of the tape under my fingers. The river below flowed calmly, and in my left ear Eason Chan was singing:\n‘The water knows well—it’s my duty to cherish the flowers.’\nThe music sounded thin, like a bird that had lost one wing.\nAnd still, I never replaced these earphones.\n\nThe right one is dead now. So be it. One side is enough.\nThis worn-out cord I clung to—\nin the end, it couldn’t keep the two worlds playing in sync.",

I've been contemplating buying the VE Devastator (110mw) but the amount of money I've spent already has disillusioned me from the audiophile dream and I've been considering selling them and getting the Ugreen Max Hitune 5c just for the convenience of a bluetooth headphone ( I also considered buying the Fiio Btr11 (30mw) since they have their own battery incase the problem was my phone power output).\n\n(My phone's not broken, my brother also has the same phone and it also sounded quiet, seems to me like either a software issue on the newer Hyper Os because I swear my old dacs sounded better a few years ago when it was still on MIUI or it can also be just a model specific problem)",

At first, I was slightly afraid they were fakes, but after listening, I am fairly sure they are the real deal.\n\nTheir value is STRONG. The cable is braided below the Y-split. Makes them appear a bit more refined, I guess. These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

    "selftext": "Hey there,\n\njust want to share some of my feelings and likings about my current Hifi-Desktop-Setup which is build of\n\n1. Eversolo DAP-A6 Gen 2 Streamer  \n2. Burson Conductor Voyager Max DAC/AMP  \n3. ModHouse Tungsten DS V1\n\n \n\nI had a lot of headphones before like Mezes Empy II or Elite, DCAs Expanse, ZMFs Atrium and Verite open, Finals D8000 Pro and Hifimans HE1000 Stealth. After all of them I can say after one moth I own the Tungsten, the Tungsten is the clear winner for me.\n\nBase is such punchy and crisp at the same time and goes so crazy deep. Holy smokes. Its also wonderful layered.\n\nMids are present but not so much in your face as Finals D8000 Pro. Its more like the HE1000 Stealth.\n\nTreble is smooth and not fatiguing overall. It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide.\n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs.\n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much.\n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Vocals sound muffled.\n* The soundstage is small.\n* I hate it.\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, Just want to clarify that this is not an \"objective review\", these are my subjective impressions, and I stand by what I wrote. As I said at the very beginning, I have my own priorities when it comes to headphones. I know some people really enjoy Sony MDR-MV1 and I am happy you enjoyed them.

The FT1 coming from some really good planar iems is an amazing leap forward for paying basically the same price. I ordered better ear pads, a capra strap. These will be the ultimate cans. Unfortunately the description on the graph site isn't detailed enough for me personally to truly understand so now we are here.\n\nI feel like the ft1's sound is very relaxing. The bass is phenomenal and very deep and visceral. The vocals are smooth. Treble is good for long term listening I'll say. But I feel like I can get a bit more excitement from these headphones. I listen to a lot of rap, a lot of female vocalist from all genres, house, dance, alternative. So bass is a common thing amongst all these genres. Boom, I added a bit more sub bass to give me some extra feelings. I've heard the sennheiser having amazing mids and since the ft1's are mildly v shaped, I raised the mids a tad bit. So I kinda eq'ed my graph to reflect the HDB 630 lower and upper mids and kept the rest the same. It's for sure, much more engaging vocally. I never realized how laid back vocals were. I will try the 6XX mids and see if I like it more. I know drivers play a big part in how sound truly is portrayed. But It made a good enough difference.\n\nNow I'm curious on some things I've noticed. What is the peak in the ft1's line around 1.8K. What is this specific frequency range responsible for. I also noticed the ft1's has a lot less treble in the 6-7K range than most cans. I felt like treble is the feeling I felt on my bones in the front of my face. I did notice raising this area was responsible for this feeling, that's maybe why these aren't as fatiguing to listen to long term. I'm a bit sensitive to treble but even the s12 planars I eq'ed like -2db from 6-7.5K and it was perfect. So I can for sure bump this area up a bit. It's interesting because my friend can use the dt 770's at high volume no issues. I could never lol. Those are some bright cans. I used to have em a long time ago that's why I have em on the graph for comparison.\n\nMy last question is eq'ing 8K or higher worth it and what immediate effects would I notice bumping this region?\n\nThanks for feedback, genuinely I'm such an immersive listener. I like to feel my music truly. If anyone here is a fan on the album Kiss Land by the weeknd. Arguably the most immersive album I ever heard. I'm very big on concept and immersion! even for video games.",

I understand this is a subjective thing, but what EQs have you guys tried?",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nI’m starting up a YouTube channel where I talk about Hi-Fi gear, but from the perspective of someone who mostly listens to bass-heavy music: hip-hop, R&B, reggaeton, metal, all the stuff that doesn’t usually get talked about much in the Hi-Fi space.\n\nI’m not asking for buying advice or comparisons, just looking to get some thoughts from people here about what kind of topics or angles would be cool to cover.\n\nI’ve got a few video ideas lined up already:\n\n1: Intro to the hobby : kind of an overview of what “Hi-Fi”actually is, why it’s fun even if your playlists are full of bass-heavy stuff, some common misconceptions, and how EQ can really help shape your sound. Also sort of some intro recs on how you can get a great setup for the same price you could wait a pair of ANC headphones or even less. \n\n2: Wireless ANC headphones: these are where most people start with higher-end gear, so I wanted to do something that talks about that whole category and how it fits into the hobby, especially for people who like tweaking sound profiles and are into bass heavy genres. \n\n3: Talking about my own gear: I’ve got a few headphones I love (HE1K Unveiled, Meze Empyrean 1) and thought it’d be fun to share what I like about them, how they respond to EQ, and how to get the sound you want out of your own setup.\n\nI think there’s room for more content that connects the “audiophile” side of things with the kind of music a lot of us listen to every day, but isn’t really represented in reviews or general talk of the hobby. Sort of give my thoughts on finding the perfect balance of a good thump in the bass, and a super clear rest of the song which just makes the music feel incredibly natural. If you’ve got ideas for what you’d want to see in that kind of channel, I’d love to hear them!\n\nAppreciate anyone who takes the time to read, I’ll share the channel later once the first video’s up. Thanks guys!\n\nEDIT: one last thing, I speak Spanish fluently so I’m thinking of making a Spanish channel as well, if you’re here and speak Spanish and would like that lmk! Thanks! ",

    "selftext": "I was first drugged into using IEMs by a friend — that’s how it all started. I began with budget models like the Tangzu Wan’er, then moved up to the Truthear Hexa and Kefine Delci. I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025. Huge shout-out to SLaudio and all the amazing people in their discord community\n\nHappy listening, guys",

    "title": "An Up-To-Date Review of the Bose Open Ultra’s",
    "selftext": "For the TLDR: They’re fantastic buds that I do recommend if you have the extra cash, but if they’re on sale, they’re absolutely worth getting. \n\n**Sound**: I’m not an audiophile, musician, or any sort of person that knows what they’re talking about when it comes to sound quality. So take my opinion here for the normie opinion that it is when I say I think they sound fantastic. I’ve always been impressed with Bose’s acoustics, their products just seem to fill the room or your world in a way I haven’t seen with other products, and these earbuds are no different - particularly with their immersive audio mode. Which makes them feel (I’m choosing the word feel on purpose) like in-ears.   \nRegarding the immersive audio, I think it’s incredibly cool. What it does is employ some acoustics tricks to make the sound like it’s coming from a source in your room. It’s *very* convincing and actually confused me at first when I turned them on thinking there was sound coming from somewhere else when it was in fact the earbuds. The “source” location is placed front and slightly above you so that it sounds like the sound is all around you but will stay stationary if you move your head (which really makes the effect pop). If you move your head and stay in the new position for a bit, the buds will move the source after a few seconds to recreate the “all around” sound again. The “motion” mode just makes the reorientation happen constantly so it’s always slightly following behind your movement. I’ve found myself mostly just always leaving it in motion mode even when sitting and only really putting it in still mode when I want to play with the effect. Switching to the mode does impact the sound, but its just as if the equalizer got changed and you can adjust it out with the equalizer. \n\n**The open ear design:** I’m a huge fan. If I want to block out the world, I have a pair of QC35’s. I use these for anytime I want to be able to hear what’s going on around me or just won’t want to wear a bulky pair of cans and the open ear design is fantastic for it. that said, It does have a noticeable drawback in that it’s easy for outside noise to drown them out. Higher pitched sounds like clanking and crashes are what are going to do it the most, and car noises on busy streets will make you have to turn them up a decent amount to still hear what’s you’re listening to clearly - particularly if you’re listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Personally, I think the trade off is worth it because it’s not a *huge* problem, but it is a noticeable one. \n\n**Comfort:** I have extremely sensitive ears, basically anything that is touching my ears will make them ache after a while. Even beanies will make my ears hurt. So I was absolutely thrilled to find that these earbuds provided a pretty significant reduction in discomfort compared to any other pair of earbuds I’ve worn in my entire life. They’re not painless, and the discomfort is moved to a different location on the ear because of their unique placement, but it’s still a pretty significant improvement and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve also never had them fall out or been even remotely concerned about it. \n\nThey are meant to be placed as close to the ear canal as you can get them, for most people, this will be at a slight angle downwards with the hook placed just above the earlobe, but you can place them pretty much anywhere in the “hook zone” which is anywhere between the lobule and start antihelix of the outer ear, so long as the speakers are inside the general concha (I hope I got the terms right I had to google ear anatomy). You can calibrate the immersion mode to however you’ve placed them on your ear so you don’t need to worry about sound quality reduction, but volume does get noticeably reduced and it gets easier for outside noise to overpower them as the speakers get farther from your ear canal. \n\n**Connectivity:** This is a field where early reviews of the product were rather negative, however Bose seems to have addressed the concerns in their firmware updates since release because I’ve had no issues. They paired easily, immediately reconnect/disconnect when taking them in and out of the case, and easily switch between my paired devices without problem. They do lack a lot of the apple ecosystem bells and whistles you get from a pair of AirPods or Beats, but that’s not Bose’s fault so I’m overlooking it. \n\n**Battery Life:** They have served me great and I’ve yet to have them die on me before I was ready. I’m not using them for all day shifts or anything, but their advertised battery life seems pretty accurate to me, maybe even conservative. The immersion mode does reduce the battery life, but not so much it’s caused me issues, and I usually have them in immersion mode. \n\n**Calls:** This is another field where a lot of early reviews said they were awful, but after having had a few calls, and asking how I sounded, nobody said I sound particularly bad. One or two did note I didn’t sound the clearest, but said it wasn’t enough to be an issue. I know Bose put out a couple firmware updates to address those early complaints and it seems like they succeeded. \n\n**Price:** This is the kicker, at $300, the cost is a big ask. And whether or not it’s worth it will really just entirely depend on your personal finances. I got mine on sale and only paid $240 (I also cashed in reward money and got a limited edition pair which were $375 full price. In the end I only ended up paying \\~$40 out of pocket) so I’m super happy with them and absolutely think they were worth it. If I had paid the full $375 - or even $300 for a normal pair however, I’m not so sure. They’re fantastic, but with them being priced so far above their competition, I definitely wouldn’t have bought them if they weren’t on sale. For the general consumer though, I think they’re a “buy on sale” set of earbuds just because of the price despite how good they are. However, if you happen to be rather wealthy and aren’t so concerned about price, they’re 100% worth grabbing. \n\n**Overall: I love them.** I strongly recommend grabbing them if you’re looking for a pair of open ears (or even in ears). It also doesn’t hurt that they’re rather stylish and kinda look like an ear ring. They sound great, feel great, work great, and stay in your ears great. The price is high, so I’d say wait for a sale if you’re more financially constrained, but if you‘re not, definitely grab them. ",

No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

    "selftext": "There seem to be infinite claims about these headphones. From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

After 4–5 years of use, the battery isn’t as strong, and I’ve had to replace the pads twice. The back of the headphones is plastic and has picked up a few scratches over time.\n\nThese days I use headphones every day for commuting, work, and workouts, so I’ve been trying different models recently. After testing ones from Bose, Sony, Skullcandy, and Baseus, I’ve been using the XH1 a lot. The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ. It also folds easily, and the ear pads are soft and comfy. I’m not an expert, but it’s been a solid experience overall. ",

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "title": "Audiophile Verdict of Bose QC Ultra 2 Headphones: DO NOT BUY 1ST GEN!",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

    "selftext": "DO NOT RECOMMEND OR PURCHASE!!\n\nThe Heavys H1H headphones, marketed for metal fans with an eight-driver design, promised durability and premium sound for $485. Instead, they delivered a flimsy build, muddy audio, and abysmal customer service, making this purchase a complete letdown.\nDurability: Shockingly Fragile\nThe website claims the H1H survived 1.8m drops onto hard floors, but this is a blatant lie. My headphones’ headband snapped in two after a mere 0.4m drop onto a soft carpeted floor. For a premium product, this fragility is outrageous. The 308g weight also made them uncomfortable for extended wear, and the satin finish attracted fingerprints, further cheapening the experience.\n\nCustomer Service: Insulting Response,\n\nWhen I contacted Heavys about the broken headband, their response was slow and unhelpful. After days of generic emails, they offered a 25% discount on another purchase. Why would I buy a faulty product again? This dismissive attitude left me feeling cheated and ignored.\n\nSound and Features: Substandard,\n\nThe sound was bass-heavy and muddy, burying vocals and guitars in tracks like Iron Maiden’s Run to the Hills. The app’s EQ barely helped, and the soundstage felt cramped. The “Hell Blocker” noise cancellation was ineffective against basic background noise, and clunky buttons made adjustments a hassle.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Heavys H1H are a massive disappointment. A fragile build, false durability claims, poor sound, and insulting customer service make these headphones a waste of money. Metal fans, steer clear and invest in something reliable.",

    "title": "3 year Review of the Audeze LCD-X (Post 2021 Version)",
    "selftext": "To start off, these are such incredible cans. It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

I would expect more at this price. honestly feels a bit plasticky and cheap. style also is very bland. doesn't look premium. Also, I personally don't like the swipe touch controls and I found them finicky.\n\nPX7 S3 - excellent. no leather. great styling and premium look. I enjoy the button controls better than the Sennheiser.\n\nPx8 S2 - excellent. has leather if you're concern about that. great styling and premium look even more than the px7. same button controls as the px7.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nHDB 630 - good but not great. with airplane noise it's about the same as the Px7. 630's were better with distinct noises like voices or background noise in a cafe or on a bus.\n\nPX7 S3 - good. not great. pretty good with airplane noise but distinct noises leak through quite a bit.\n\nPx8 S2 - just okay. worst of the bunch surprisingly. let in more airplane noise than the other two and distinct sounds leaked through quite a bit like the Px7\n\n**SQ:**\n\n**HDB 630:**\n\ntuning: pretty neutral\n\nspace and technicalities: space and staging is good. not great but all three are closed back so that's a natural limitation. Sennheiser is more relaxed and less \"fun\" but some audiophiles prefer that. both the Px7 and Px8 everything sounds closer and more \"fun\". good technicalities though. everything feels snappy and controlled. instrument separation is great.\n\nbass: well extended into sub bass and well controlled but is definitely not the star of the show. a bit thin sounding if you're not used to audiophile tuning. they can rumble though if you boost the bass with the EQ\n\nmids: maybe it's the audiophile tuning but it sounds a bit shouty to me. definitely not warm. lower mids seems thin while upper mids sound too forward. vocals sound a bit thin and snares sound a little sharp. actually a bit annoying to my ears but I tend to be treble sensitive.\n\ntreble: great as you would suspect from audiophile tuning. well extended and controlled but do weirdly get harsh for me. again, I'm a bit sensitive to treble so YMMV with that.\n\n**PX7 S3:**\n\ntuning: very bloated bass. maybe you'll like it if you're a basshead. good extension into sub bass but a bit less controlled than the px8 and 630 but still pretty good.\n\nspace and technicalities: worst of the bunch but still pretty good and pleasant to the ears. I only really notice they're worse after listening to the other headphones. both the px8 and 630 extract more detail and sound more spacious and 3D.\n\nbass: way bloated. strong and good extension into sub bass\n\nmids: my favorite here actually. sounds intimate and full. smooth and fun tuning. not shouty.\n\ntreble: my favorite also. sounds well extended and airy but not overly so. doesn't get sharp or shouty. maybe a tad rolled off and recessed compared to true audiophile tuning but to my ear they are close to just right. very pleasant sounding. the treble adds a bit of nice air and sparkle without getting annoying.\n\n**Px8 S2:**\n\ntuning: I would still consider these bass bloated but less so than the px7. mids feel a tiny bit more recessed than the px7 but more present and forward than the 630. more treble presence than the px7. maybe about the same as the 630 but sounds less shouty.\n\nspace and technicalities: very good here. better 3D space and detail than the px7. bass is tighter and transients feels slightly snappier than the px7. similar to the 630 in terms of space and detail but again, the B&Ws feel closer and more \"fun\".\n\nbass: my favorite bass of the three. still sounds bloated to me but less so than the px7. more balanced and controlled than the px7. definitely way more power here than the 630 without EQing.\n\nmids: very good. tiny bit recessed compared to the px7. sounds smooth and balanced.\n\ntreble: very good here. well controlled and extended but still sounds smooth. about the same presence as the 630 but sounds more balanced to me.\n\n**what I'm keeping?**\n\nto my surprise, I think I'm keeping the Px7 S3. I'm hoping the band loosens a bit. the ANC is pretty good especially with airplane noise. the B&W styling is very attractive. mids and highs are great and tuned to my liking. sense of space and technicalities are still very good and pleasant to listen to. and for now, I have the low bass down 3.5 and mid bass down 2.0 and they sound less bloated.",

After doing some research I cannot believe how many sets of headphones have come out over the past few years as before it was strictly a few set of headphones to choose from. \n\nAnyways, to make a long story short my X2HR's are starting to fall apart on the left earcup and the pads needed to be replaced. \n\nI Purchased 3 headphones to test:\n\n1.) **Fiio FT1 Pro**:\n\nWow Fiio makes headphones now?! and a planar?! yes please!\n\nComfortable. Droolworthy bass + sub bass. OK soundstage/imaging. Sibilant.\n\n2.) **Sennheiser HD560S**:\n\nI've never been huge on the Sennheiser sound, even with HD598s/HD600s/HD650s but these got a lot of hype.\n\nVery uncomfortable, too tight for my large head. Meh bass. OK soundstage/imaging. Boring.\n\n3.) **Beyerdynamic TYGR 300R**:\n\nI've had a couple Beyers in the past and used to daily a modded set of DT770/250ohm. I found the DT880s and DT990s too sibilant, more so with the former.\n\nInsanely comfortable. Awesome bass + sub bass (FT1 pro is better), droolworthy soundstage/imaging.\n\nI cannot believe the things I am hearing in music and while playing BF6, I can pinpoint instruments and gunshots in any direction like I'm right there. All of this and no Beyer sibilance? absolutely brilliant.\n\nThese headphones are damn near perfect for my use case while being sensitive to higher frequencies. If you dont take lightly to bright headphones give these a try!\n\n",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 - Maybe Buy 2 Headphones Instead",
    "selftext": "**TLDR:** Good sound, good customization, bad comfort, finnicky connectivity, high price. Audeze Maxwell + Momentum 4 for $50 more (can be less if you're cool with open box) do more things better.\n\n**The positives:**\n\n* **One of the best ever sounding closed backs**, definitely the best I've heard with ANC (vs Bathys, XM5/XM6, Momentum 4, QC Ultra, Airpods Max), competes with or beats many wired closed backs. I think they fall just short of Audeze Maxwell with some EQ adjustments, but those headphones are very close to my tastes out of the box so YMMV.\n* Pairs great tuning with anatomy measurements to normalize low end performance between different users and re-seating.\n* **PEQ** to dial in to your tastes\n* **Low latency** (matched my monitor's input lag near identically in gaming mode by my perception))and high res Bluetooth connections with the dongle. I think Sennheiser are getting close to or even beating that 30ms latency in the low latency dongle mode\n* **The sound with the dongle is excellent**, even in the low latency mode\n* Solid all around functionality as a portable ANC headphone\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n* **Comfort is not great**. Fairly shallow pads that compress easily cause heat and pressure on the pinna, and I don't have big ears. They (and Momentum 4) also have an odd cup angle that requires you to rotate the headband forward which is sub-optimal. For comparison, I find the Bathys comfier in the pads but slightly less comfy in the headband. I hate the XM5/XM6 comfort-wise, 630 are an improvement. APM are comfier and QC Ultra are much much comfier.\n* The WC Freeze pads for Momentum 4 fit and are way comfier but hurt the seal a lot (which makes ANC and sound both much worse) making those pads a complete no-go IMO.\n* No 2.4GHz on the dongle\n* Finicky pairing and touch controls. Same issues as Momentum 4.\n* **No ability to use the mic + get full sound quality at the same time**\n* No options for a boom mic\n* **Boring looking and no color options,** and they are a bit too thick in the cups to look normal vs other ANC.\n* **Expensive**: **You can get a pair of Momentum 4 + an Audeze Maxwell for $50 more**, and less than the price of the HDB 630 if you are willing to do refurbs/open box. Maxwell is comfier to me (weight doesn't bother me, capra strap improves even more) and sounds better + has the boom mic and low latency via 2.4ghz. Momentum 4 sounds pretty good with the built in graphic EQ and not that much worse than HDB 630 if you use another app for PEQ.\n\n**Deeper Sound Breakdown**: These headphones were very quickly determined to be not worth the money for me, so these impressions are not my most thorough. As with all sound impressions, YMMV.\n\n* **Tuning**\n   * They are **a bit mid-bass focused** for me, sounding a bit bloated in the low end. Luckily the blending into the mids is very clean and not boomy. The extension is good, but the midbass focus also reduces how apparent this is\n   * **The mids are very nice.** Perhaps a bit lacking in energy, but this can be fixed with a peak filter most likely somewhere between 1-3k. I often find 2-2.5k helps with this a lot.\n   * **They are very natural sounding in timbre**. This is the one thing that they solidly beat the Momentum 4 at even with the M4 dialed in with the in-app EQ.\n   * **The treble very even and pleasant albeit** maybe a tad too relaxed for me.\n* **Technicalities**\n   * **Bass texture is lacking.** Even with a filter reigning in the midbass, they lacked the grit and texture in the low-end that I really look for in a headphone\n   * **Treble is a bit oversmoothed, leading to a perceived lack of resolution**. This may actually be affecting the bass texture situation.\n   * **They aren't that punchy or energetic**. The midbass focus and a bit of relaxed 1-3k lead to a bit of dullness. Kick drums don't impact as nicely as I'd like, and higher voices don't come through as strongly as I think they should.\n   * **They are a well-controlled but not super 'fast'.** Especially with the bass reduced, they do give the impression of not being sloppy or slow, but they aren't super quick in terms of attack or decay.\n   * **A note about imaging/soundstage**: I am a speaker guy first and foremost. I don't get any impression of verticality or layering from any headphones unless the music is mastered specifically with headphones and spaciousness in mind. I find that production to be very rare. The things I do notice are imaging and distance. **The imaging is good; t**his is mostly just down to consistent channel matching across the FR. **Spaciousness is exactly what you'd expect.** They aren't completely inside my head, but they give no impression the sound is coming from a distance outside of the headphone. This is typical for me for closed backs.\n* **EQ Suggestions:**\n   * Peak filter around 120hz, q\\~1, -1-3db to get rid of the bass bloat\n   * If you are more of a bass roll-off fan, do a bass shelf with 2-5db reduction.\n   * Find the area between 1-3k that increasing with a q filter of \\~1 by 1-3db gives you more energy and punch.\n   * Find any over-emphasis in the low treble, 3-7k and reduce that if needed.\n   * See if you have any aggressive peaks above 5k, and reduce them with smaller q value filters\n   * Add a treble shelf to boost detail if needed.\n\n**Summary:** excellent sound especially with PEQ, mediocre comfort, boring design that looks a bit bulky on head, good latency and sound via dongle, no boom mic, sound is bad when using mic, and pricey vs a dedicated ANC + dedicated gaming headphone. I like the Maxwell + Momentum 4 enough to make it a no-go for me. **But if the mic situation and comfort are good for you, they're very hard to beat as an all-around single solution.**",

While I think the ATs beat them in imaging, it isn’t that big of a difference. They are less comfortable, don’t have any bass, build quality feels cheap. \n\nI tried them with BF6 and while it was immersive, the moment I put on the 490s after these the difference was apparent. The velour pads work well with my glasses and are way more comfortable than the audio technicas. \n\nI also tried listening to some music, namely BRAT because I love the production on that album and these lacked any sort of punch. I have SONY MDR MV1s coming in tomorrow, will see how they hold up against what I already have. Looking for something more V shaped and lush compared to the 560s sound signature and I’ve heard that the mv1s fit that description well. If they don’t I might return the 490s, R70xas and MV1s and skipping mid fi completely and move to some Hi Fi offerings like Clears/Meze 109 pro/FT7 (because I want to try planars). Any other suggestions are welcome, looking for open backs with a big soundstage as well as a bass boost. Not too concerned with neutrality. ",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Quick Impressions",
    "selftext": "Just got these in and wow — out of the box they sound superb. The tuning is really neutral and everything comes together seamlessly. The bass has great extension and presence — it adds solid weight and heft to the music without bleeding into the mids or muddying up vocals. Speaking of vocals, they’re insanely clear, super natural, and have that spot-on timbre Sennheiser does so well. Instruments sound very lifelike with great clarity and separation too.\n\nTreble is crisp and airy but never harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is actually excellent for a closed-back set, and imaging is really precise. Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other — everything has its space.\n\nHaven’t played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it’s nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony’s level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it’s impressive how well the ANC works — definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn’t.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn’t quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it’s not far behind — way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts — 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I’d still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I’m really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic — clean, balanced, natural — and they’re super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic — super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality’s surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

    "selftext": "Listening to them as I write this. Technically a fist impression but like I know what I'm listening for and done all my test songs so I feel confident on how I feel. They sound great, shocker right. The big thing is music just sounds correct in these. Good bass extension so still fun. Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

Burson Conductor Voyager Max DAC/AMP  \n3. ModHouse Tungsten DS V1\n\n \n\nI had a lot of headphones before like Mezes Empy II or Elite, DCAs Expanse, ZMFs Atrium and Verite open, Finals D8000 Pro and Hifimans HE1000 Stealth. After all of them I can say after one moth I own the Tungsten, the Tungsten is the clear winner for me.\n\nBase is such punchy and crisp at the same time and goes so crazy deep. Holy smokes. Its also wonderful layered.\n\nMids are present but not so much in your face as Finals D8000 Pro. Its more like the HE1000 Stealth.\n\nTreble is smooth and not fatiguing overall. It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

    "title": "A good dongle DAC to work with Windows 11 without problems?",
    "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nI'm here today to ask you about the dongle DAC's that is usable with Windows-based PC.\n\nI know there are a lot of them for different price points, and I guess I didn't need them too much, because I only got easy to drive SGH 9500 and Beyers 770 Pro X LE (that are stupidly broken by themselves in the can connection points with very light gentle use and now I'm awaiting for them to return from the service), but now I want to try IEM's and I guess I need a better source then my motherboard audio.\n\nFor the start I don't want to get anything crazy, simply because I'm in Ukraine and I try to keep my purchases relatively cheap, so that's why I want to go under 100 USD with dongle or something portable.\n\nBut as far as I know the things that work well with the phones may have some issues on the PC side of things.\n\nSo I need a dongle, that have a clear sound and also didn't fall asleep, disconnect rapidly or have driver problems on the PC.\n\nI will get something better if there will be safe again, but for now I need something reliable and fun.\n\nI was thinking about Apple Dongle and TRN Black Pearl, but I heard that TRN one have some issues with entering a standby mode so it can fade out notifications etc. And the driver is not too good for the PC use.\n\nI'll happily read all your recommendations, thank you so much in advance.\n\n  \nUPD: Thank you everyone, I've got Apple dongle for now and I guess I'll go with something more meaty bit later.",

    "selftext": "Frequency curve taken from [hangout.audio](http://hangout.audio) , I hope St. Crin forgives me.\n\nGot them new for 5€ (shipping included) from a private seller on the electronic bay who got them bundled with their phone but didn't need them. At first, I was slightly afraid they were fakes, but after listening, I am fairly sure they are the real deal.\n\nTheir value is STRONG. The cable is braided below the Y-split. Makes them appear a bit more refined, I guess. These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

    "title": "Comparison between HE600, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, FT1 Pro, FT7,  AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1.",
    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide.\n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs.\n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much.\n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Vocals sound muffled.\n* The soundstage is small.\n* I hate it.\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, Just want to clarify that this is not an \"objective review\", these are my subjective impressions, and I stand by what I wrote. As I said at the very beginning, I have my own priorities when it comes to headphones. I know some people really enjoy Sony MDR-MV1 and I am happy you enjoyed them. Cheers! \n\nIf you have any questions leave a comment I will answer them",

    "selftext": "I am a regular music listener and always use my headphones to do so, however using them for a long time builds up a lot of earwax which often completely shuts off my ear after waking up. The mesh around it too get earwax on them, needing to clean them every few days.  \nIt's just become a regular routine for me to clean off my earwax atleast once a day to avoid getting my ears shut off due to the wax. Was not too confident with hydrogen peroxide, so got an ear camera cleaning tool by bebird, and honestly it is quite good to use.  \nThe scoop is silicone based so i dont feel much sceptical about it to not put in my ear... However for my headphones i dont have any solution to the wax which gets stuck on the mesh, even after trying to get it off by toothpick and small objects it just stays there. Removing it would obviously damage the pre glued seal which would have to be reapplied then. Any suggestions for removing the earwax from the mesh of the headphone..?",

    "title": "3 year Review of the Audeze LCD-X (Post 2021 Version)",
    "selftext": "To start off, these are such incredible cans. It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

It should reappear in a week, along with my post, hehe.\nSennheiser said there are only 80 units of this color and are not for sale, and they will not produce any more in the future so maybe is not a HD800S or a HE-1 but is still a very rare gear with the legendary sound that the HD25 already has.\n(btw it sounds like any other HD25, and i tested their sound but this will NOT be my dairy pair, because is so rare that i dont want it to get dirty or damaged)\nDue to personal financial problems, the idea of selling them crossed my mind, but I honestly believe they are invaluable and even if I put a price on them, I doubt anyone would want to pay that price.\nThen I will keep them with the love and respect they deserve.",

    "selftext": "**source:** tidal or personal flac files through bluetooth aptx\n\n**FIT:**\n\nHDB 630 - very comfortable but loosest of the bunch. felt a bit insecure. if l looked up or shook my head I had that feeling they may fall off. smaller ear cups too if you're concern about that and I could feel contact with my ears but nothing uncomfortable for me.\n\nPX7 S3 - slightly more clamping force which got a little uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. best seal out of the bunch so pick your poison.\n\nPx8 S2 - most comfortable. not too tight, not too loose. just right on my head. doesn't feel insecure.\n\n**BUILD QUALITY:**\n\nHDB 630 - decent. I would expect more at this price. honestly feels a bit plasticky and cheap. style also is very bland. doesn't look premium. Also, I personally don't like the swipe touch controls and I found them finicky.\n\nPX7 S3 - excellent. no leather. great styling and premium look. I enjoy the button controls better than the Sennheiser.\n\nPx8 S2 - excellent. has leather if you're concern about that. great styling and premium look even more than the px7. same button controls as the px7.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nHDB 630 - good but not great. with airplane noise it's about the same as the Px7. 630's were better with distinct noises like voices or background noise in a cafe or on a bus.\n\nPX7 S3 - good. not great. pretty good with airplane noise but distinct noises leak through quite a bit.\n\nPx8 S2 - just okay. worst of the bunch surprisingly. let in more airplane noise than the other two and distinct sounds leaked through quite a bit like the Px7\n\n**SQ:**\n\n**HDB 630:**\n\ntuning: pretty neutral\n\nspace and technicalities: space and staging is good. not great but all three are closed back so that's a natural limitation. Sennheiser is more relaxed and less \"fun\" but some audiophiles prefer that. both the Px7 and Px8 everything sounds closer and more \"fun\". good technicalities though. everything feels snappy and controlled. instrument separation is great.\n\nbass: well extended into sub bass and well controlled but is definitely not the star of the show. a bit thin sounding if you're not used to audiophile tuning. they can rumble though if you boost the bass with the EQ\n\nmids: maybe it's the audiophile tuning but it sounds a bit shouty to me. definitely not warm. lower mids seems thin while upper mids sound too forward. vocals sound a bit thin and snares sound a little sharp. actually a bit annoying to my ears but I tend to be treble sensitive.\n\ntreble: great as you would suspect from audiophile tuning. well extended and controlled but do weirdly get harsh for me. again, I'm a bit sensitive to treble so YMMV with that.\n\n**PX7 S3:**\n\ntuning: very bloated bass. maybe you'll like it if you're a basshead. good extension into sub bass but a bit less controlled than the px8 and 630 but still pretty good.\n\nspace and technicalities: worst of the bunch but still pretty good and pleasant to the ears. I only really notice they're worse after listening to the other headphones. both the px8 and 630 extract more detail and sound more spacious and 3D.\n\nbass: way bloated. strong and good extension into sub bass\n\nmids: my favorite here actually. sounds intimate and full. smooth and fun tuning. not shouty.\n\ntreble: my favorite also. sounds well extended and airy but not overly so. doesn't get sharp or shouty. maybe a tad rolled off and recessed compared to true audiophile tuning but to my ear they are close to just right. very pleasant sounding. the treble adds a bit of nice air and sparkle without getting annoying.\n\n**Px8 S2:**\n\ntuning: I would still consider these bass bloated but less so than the px7. mids feel a tiny bit more recessed than the px7 but more present and forward than the 630. more treble presence than the px7. maybe about the same as the 630 but sounds less shouty.\n\nspace and technicalities: very good here. better 3D space and detail than the px7. bass is tighter and transients feels slightly snappier than the px7. similar to the 630 in terms of space and detail but again, the B&Ws feel closer and more \"fun\".\n\nbass: my favorite bass of the three. still sounds bloated to me but less so than the px7. more balanced and controlled than the px7. definitely way more power here than the 630 without EQing.\n\nmids: very good. tiny bit recessed compared to the px7. sounds smooth and balanced.\n\ntreble: very good here. well controlled and extended but still sounds smooth. about the same presence as the 630 but sounds more balanced to me.\n\n**what I'm keeping?**\n\nto my surprise, I think I'm keeping the Px7 S3. I'm hoping the band loosens a bit. the ANC is pretty good especially with airplane noise. the B&W styling is very attractive. mids and highs are great and tuned to my liking. sense of space and technicalities are still very good and pleasant to listen to. and for now, I have the low bass down 3.5 and mid bass down 2.0 and they sound less bloated.",

After doing some research I cannot believe how many sets of headphones have come out over the past few years as before it was strictly a few set of headphones to choose from. \n\nAnyways, to make a long story short my X2HR's are starting to fall apart on the left earcup and the pads needed to be replaced. \n\nI Purchased 3 headphones to test:\n\n1.) **Fiio FT1 Pro**:\n\nWow Fiio makes headphones now?! and a planar?! yes please!\n\nComfortable. Droolworthy bass + sub bass. OK soundstage/imaging. Sibilant.\n\n2.) **Sennheiser HD560S**:\n\nI've never been huge on the Sennheiser sound, even with HD598s/HD600s/HD650s but these got a lot of hype.\n\nVery uncomfortable, too tight for my large head. Meh bass. OK soundstage/imaging. Boring.\n\n3.) **Beyerdynamic TYGR 300R**:\n\nI've had a couple Beyers in the past and used to daily a modded set of DT770/250ohm. I found the DT880s and DT990s too sibilant, more so with the former.\n\nInsanely comfortable. Awesome bass + sub bass (FT1 pro is better), droolworthy soundstage/imaging.\n\nI cannot believe the things I am hearing in music and while playing BF6, I can pinpoint instruments and gunshots in any direction like I'm right there. All of this and no Beyer sibilance? absolutely brilliant.\n\nThese headphones are damn near perfect for my use case while being sensitive to higher frequencies. If you dont take lightly to bright headphones give these a try!\n\n",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 - Maybe Buy 2 Headphones Instead",
    "selftext": "**TLDR:** Good sound, good customization, bad comfort, finnicky connectivity, high price. Audeze Maxwell + Momentum 4 for $50 more (can be less if you're cool with open box) do more things better.\n\n**The positives:**\n\n* **One of the best ever sounding closed backs**, definitely the best I've heard with ANC (vs Bathys, XM5/XM6, Momentum 4, QC Ultra, Airpods Max), competes with or beats many wired closed backs. I think they fall just short of Audeze Maxwell with some EQ adjustments, but those headphones are very close to my tastes out of the box so YMMV.\n* Pairs great tuning with anatomy measurements to normalize low end performance between different users and re-seating.\n* **PEQ** to dial in to your tastes\n* **Low latency** (matched my monitor's input lag near identically in gaming mode by my perception))and high res Bluetooth connections with the dongle. I think Sennheiser are getting close to or even beating that 30ms latency in the low latency dongle mode\n* **The sound with the dongle is excellent**, even in the low latency mode\n* Solid all around functionality as a portable ANC headphone\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n* **Comfort is not great**. Fairly shallow pads that compress easily cause heat and pressure on the pinna, and I don't have big ears. They (and Momentum 4) also have an odd cup angle that requires you to rotate the headband forward which is sub-optimal. For comparison, I find the Bathys comfier in the pads but slightly less comfy in the headband. I hate the XM5/XM6 comfort-wise, 630 are an improvement. APM are comfier and QC Ultra are much much comfier.\n* The WC Freeze pads for Momentum 4 fit and are way comfier but hurt the seal a lot (which makes ANC and sound both much worse) making those pads a complete no-go IMO.\n* No 2.4GHz on the dongle\n* Finicky pairing and touch controls. Same issues as Momentum 4.\n* **No ability to use the mic + get full sound quality at the same time**\n* No options for a boom mic\n* **Boring looking and no color options,** and they are a bit too thick in the cups to look normal vs other ANC.\n* **Expensive**: **You can get a pair of Momentum 4 + an Audeze Maxwell for $50 more**, and less than the price of the HDB 630 if you are willing to do refurbs/open box. Maxwell is comfier to me (weight doesn't bother me, capra strap improves even more) and sounds better + has the boom mic and low latency via 2.4ghz. Momentum 4 sounds pretty good with the built in graphic EQ and not that much worse than HDB 630 if you use another app for PEQ.\n\n**Deeper Sound Breakdown**: These headphones were very quickly determined to be not worth the money for me, so these impressions are not my most thorough. As with all sound impressions, YMMV.\n\n* **Tuning**\n   * They are **a bit mid-bass focused** for me, sounding a bit bloated in the low end. Luckily the blending into the mids is very clean and not boomy. The extension is good, but the midbass focus also reduces how apparent this is\n   * **The mids are very nice.** Perhaps a bit lacking in energy, but this can be fixed with a peak filter most likely somewhere between 1-3k. I often find 2-2.5k helps with this a lot.\n   * **They are very natural sounding in timbre**. This is the one thing that they solidly beat the Momentum 4 at even with the M4 dialed in with the in-app EQ.\n   * **The treble very even and pleasant albeit** maybe a tad too relaxed for me.\n* **Technicalities**\n   * **Bass texture is lacking.** Even with a filter reigning in the midbass, they lacked the grit and texture in the low-end that I really look for in a headphone\n   * **Treble is a bit oversmoothed, leading to a perceived lack of resolution**. This may actually be affecting the bass texture situation.\n   * **They aren't that punchy or energetic**. The midbass focus and a bit of relaxed 1-3k lead to a bit of dullness. Kick drums don't impact as nicely as I'd like, and higher voices don't come through as strongly as I think they should.\n   * **They are a well-controlled but not super 'fast'.** Especially with the bass reduced, they do give the impression of not being sloppy or slow, but they aren't super quick in terms of attack or decay.\n   * **A note about imaging/soundstage**: I am a speaker guy first and foremost. I don't get any impression of verticality or layering from any headphones unless the music is mastered specifically with headphones and spaciousness in mind. I find that production to be very rare. The things I do notice are imaging and distance. **The imaging is good; t**his is mostly just down to consistent channel matching across the FR. **Spaciousness is exactly what you'd expect.** They aren't completely inside my head, but they give no impression the sound is coming from a distance outside of the headphone. This is typical for me for closed backs.\n* **EQ Suggestions:**\n   * Peak filter around 120hz, q\\~1, -1-3db to get rid of the bass bloat\n   * If you are more of a bass roll-off fan, do a bass shelf with 2-5db reduction.\n   * Find the area between 1-3k that increasing with a q filter of \\~1 by 1-3db gives you more energy and punch.\n   * Find any over-emphasis in the low treble, 3-7k and reduce that if needed.\n   * See if you have any aggressive peaks above 5k, and reduce them with smaller q value filters\n   * Add a treble shelf to boost detail if needed.\n\n**Summary:** excellent sound especially with PEQ, mediocre comfort, boring design that looks a bit bulky on head, good latency and sound via dongle, no boom mic, sound is bad when using mic, and pricey vs a dedicated ANC + dedicated gaming headphone. I like the Maxwell + Momentum 4 enough to make it a no-go for me. **But if the mic situation and comfort are good for you, they're very hard to beat as an all-around single solution.**",

    "selftext": "Fiio k11 is my DAC/AMP\n\nGot a pair of R70xas from Audio technica in today and these are probably one of the worst headphones I’ve ever tried. \nRight now on my desk I have the HD 490 pros and 560s. While I think the ATs beat them in imaging, it isn’t that big of a difference. They are less comfortable, don’t have any bass, build quality feels cheap. \n\nI tried them with BF6 and while it was immersive, the moment I put on the 490s after these the difference was apparent. The velour pads work well with my glasses and are way more comfortable than the audio technicas. \n\nI also tried listening to some music, namely BRAT because I love the production on that album and these lacked any sort of punch. I have SONY MDR MV1s coming in tomorrow, will see how they hold up against what I already have. Looking for something more V shaped and lush compared to the 560s sound signature and I’ve heard that the mv1s fit that description well. If they don’t I might return the 490s, R70xas and MV1s and skipping mid fi completely and move to some Hi Fi offerings like Clears/Meze 109 pro/FT7 (because I want to try planars). Any other suggestions are welcome, looking for open backs with a big soundstage as well as a bass boost. Not too concerned with neutrality. ",

They all just say install Epic and play your gog games.  Anyone have experience with this..

Noticed the battery dropped to 71%. I decided to go charge it. Left it for 30 minutes and it remained at 71%. Got my power bank that outputs up to 65W. And the voltage reading was 15V(normal) and amps at 0.2-0.5A. Decided to use my UPS to use the stock charger and observed the same wattage around 3 to 8 wattage. As soon I put the steam deck to sleep mode, the ampage went to zero.  \n\nWent to the repair shop to hopefully get it fixed but as I was demonstrating my issue using my power bank the ampage read 2.2A at 15V. They humored me and took to investigate but they had no issue charging it. I retrieve the steam deck the following day. \n\nI attempted to charge it and it did charge like normal. I decided to play for about 2 hours and the battery dropped to 68%. I decided to charge one more time and again it does not charge. Same issue I had prior to going back to the repair shop.\n\nMade a ticket with Valve to see if they could come up with a solution \n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue?\n",

    "selftext": "I’ve been running into a few games recently that are listed as *Playable* on Steam Deck, but in practice they crash often or struggle to stay above 30 FPS. It feels misleading when something that clearly doesn’t run well still gets that label.\n\nI understand that *Verified* is meant for perfect compatibility, but *Playable* should still mean it’s a smooth, stable experience, not “it launches and sort of works.”\n\nIn my opinion, for a game to be marked *Playable* on Deck, it should:  \n• Run without crashes or freezes  \n• Hold a consistent 60 FPS or at least maintain stable performance  \n• Have controls and UI that work properly without major tweaks\n\nIf it can’t meet those basic standards, it should really just be marked as *Unsupported*. Right now, the label feels too generous and doesn’t match the actual experience.\n\nThis matters because people are making purchase decisions based on these labels. If a game is marked *Playable*, most users will assume it runs decently out of the box — not that it’ll crash or run at half the expected frame rate.\n\nWhat do you all think? Should Valve tighten the criteria for what counts as *Playable* on Deck?",

However, this was the outcome of everything I did and I was wondering if I did something wrong. \n\nHere's what I did:\n\nFirst Try:\n1. I followed everything in the GitHub step by step this means my Stardew Valley (SV) has to be intalled in Windows through Proton Experimental. So I uninstalled mine, set its compatibility to PE before installing it again.\n\n2. I went to the Manual Patching through Gaming Mode, selected SV as the game, and selected OpenGL.\n\n3. I installed Natural Color ReShade from Nexusmods (link: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1213) extracted it, copied its files and had put it into my SV game files. \n\n4. I then opened the folder and found its .fx files through steamapps/common/Stardew Valley/reshade-shaders--->(this was the contents of the Natural Color reshade I downloaded)/Shaders which I then copied it and pasted it to my .local/share/reshade/External_reshade folder.\n\nI'm not sure if I did something wrong from the steps above and if I did please let me know.\n\nI alao tried to tinker with it hoping it might actually work so what I did was I copied the contents of the Natural Color ReShade and pasted it to .local/share/reshade/ReShade_shaders folder but it still did not work.",

    "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nSo, I'm writing this post because I'm experiencing some wonkiness with my right trigger button being triggered when I haven't touched it... and I'm not sure if it's a system-wide issue or if it's a game-specific issue. Though, it has been persisting across two games in particular: Saints Row 3 and Saints Row 4. Specifically, when I get out of certain states (like, when I go to Friendly Fire or exit pause or boot the game up), my weapon fires in spite of the RT button not being pressed. Additionally, for some missions, when I actually do hit RT to try to fire the weapon - it doesn't fire... and the workaround I've found is to hit the Steam button to pause the game and then restart it so that the weapon will fire upon leaving pause.\n\nNow, I have made a couple of aftermarket alterations to what's inside the deck - most notably, changing out the joysticks and installing a kit to make the buttons more clicky. Also, I stuck an AirTag in my Steam Deck because after having left my Steam Deck on a plane in Vancouver (shoutout to Air North, whose staff were able to get my Steam Deck back to me same day). So, I'm wondering if I fucked up my right trigger button through my alterations, or if this is just a bug with these two Saints Row games. I saw nothing about the games on ProtonDB.",

The seem to be very lose compared to what I am used to. I am not sure if it is the tension they are distend with or if they are taller than other controllers I use (PS5 dual sense, joycon, switch 2 pro controller). Those have a consistent feel to them but these seem quite a bit different. I wanted to see what the community consensus is. \n\nAlso weird thing first game I played was Lumines arise demo (can’t wait for full game) then Hades 2 then Pac-Man championship edition. When I went to launch packman it asked if I wanted to close hades 2. I clicked yes and then it got hung loading Pac-Man. I then found that in addition to hades 2 being open lumines was still open. What I am missing? I am used to switch 2 only having one game open at a time. (Still impressive hades 2 ran so well with another game in the background). ",

The mic still works perfectly on my PS5 and laptop, so it’s definitely something with the Deck.\n\nI’ve already done everything Steam Support suggested, including full shutdowns, changing input devices, audio resets, checking PulseAudio and PipeWire, and testing in desktop mode, but nothing has fixed it.\n\nAny idea on how to fix this?",

    "selftext": "Hi, I’m on a Steam Deck LCD running SteamOS 3.7.15.\n\n\n\nEver since this update (or maybe the one right before it), my audio dies whenever I disconnect my Bluetooth earbuds (Jabra Elite 10). After ending a call or turning the buds off, everything goes silent and videos won’t play. In Chrome the player shows a “If this keeps happening, restart your device” type message.\n\n\n\nA full reboot fixes it, but that’s a pain.\n\n\n\nWhat fixes it without rebooting (Desktop Mode only):\n\n`systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber`\n\nRun that in a terminal and sound comes back right away.\n\n\n\nThe catch: I usually play in Game Mode, and there’s no terminal there, so when it breaks I’m stuck with no audio until I reboot or switch to Desktop Mode just to run that command.\n\n\n\nAnyone else have the same problem? I googled it and found zero Reddit posts about it.\n\n\n\nIs there a Game Mode friendly workaround (Decky plugin, quick toggle, something similar)? Anything I can try so it doesn’t break after a Bluetooth disconnect?\n\n\n\nI first noticed it after finishing a Discord call with my headset, then Chrome videos refused to play. If logs would help, tell me what to grab and I’ll post them.\n\n",

That was earlier this year, have any work-arounds been figured out?\n\nIf not, what else is recommended? I'm not looking to run any VR games on my deck I just want a decent app to stream my deck to my Pico 4 to be used as a big screen. steamlink is terrible, I've managed to get better streaming from my desktop at home to the deck at my partner's place than the streaming I get from the deck to my headset (in the same house on the same wifi network, all of which's points are about 15ft away from one another.)\n\nAll I have attempted this far is using GE to use the setup which went fine and put the actual exe for the application where you'd expect a windows-only installation to go, neither GE, proton 9.04 or proton 7 get it to launch through desktop mode or game mode, I really don't know what else to try.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, even if you're not certain it'll work yourself, just don't get me to brick my deck please :)",

Not explicitly horror games. It seems I cannot play anything else before the Resident Evil 9 release 😭 I really like the atmosphere of RE games, inventory management, weapons/upgrades, straightline quests and etc.\n\nI even tried days gone, but it was not a good experience.\n\n- Previously Enjoyed Games: RE remakes 2,3,4; RE 7,8; Tomb raider trilogy; Half Life Alyx; Borderlands 1,2,3; Mafia 1,2,3 and remakes;\n- Preferred Genres: Survival horror, rpg, 1st person, 3rd person. More like tomb riders and RE.\n- Budget: Any.\n- Other Notes: preferably games should run on a steam deck even only with 30fps with lowest graphics preset (I will use lossless scaling to boost a performance a little bit)\n\n",

It keeps doing the launch sign, goes into Steam logo loading, then goes back to Green Play button as if nothing happened\n\n  \nBelow are the solutions I tried:\n\n1) Changed proton versions (I tried all of Proton 8 until 10). When I tried proton 5, the anti cheat screen was able to pop up (but it goes back to the green play button)\n\n2) Disabled Decky\n\n3) Tried the launch option commands\n\n4) deleted compact data and shaders\n\n5) disabled wifi\n\n  \nI really would love if someone can help me. thanks a lot in advance!",

I tried every combination of buttons I could find online, every troubleshooting guide, and nothing worked. So I opened the Steam Deck to find... the picture attached! Comparing it to replacement batteries online, this is really quite swollen. I got the advice to discharge it, of course, since lithium batteries explode, but I cannot do that because the Steam Deck won't turn on. So I wanted to ask two things:\n1) How the Hell do I remove this battery? I can't apply heat to it because it's fully charged, so the glue that's under the battery won't come undone.\n2) Is the problem likely to be the battery? I would like to know if all I need is a replacement battery or if my console's life I'd well and truly over.\n\nThanks in advance!",

The mic still works perfectly on my PS5 and laptop, so it’s definitely something with the Deck.\n\nI’ve already done everything Steam Support suggested, including full shutdowns, changing input devices, audio resets, checking PulseAudio and PipeWire, and testing in desktop mode, but nothing has fixed it.\n\nAny idea on how to fix this?",

I just submitted a claim for a cracked screen and it was denied. Reason stated that the Steam Deck is not covered by Home Plus.\n\nI wanted to give people a heads up on their service and products.\n\n\nUPDATE: Hello everyone, I wanted to give an update. Shoutout to u/Asurion_Alex for helping me get in contact with Asurion. A supervisor got in contact with me and helped me re-file a claim and it got accepted.\nWhat had happened was, I first submitted a claim through the mobile app, but because something was missing or i didnt answer correctly it was rejected. I then called the same day to refile a claim over the phone. I answered all the questions and provided all need info but it was rejected a 2nd time. I posted here and at r/Asurion, and u/Asurion_Alex gave me a POC to reach out to. A supervisor reached out to me within a few hours. It was explained to me that when the first claim was rejected, and I resubmitted a 2nd claim, the first one did not clear quickly enough and thus the 2nd claim was rejected due to the first claim, or at least that was close to what was explained to me. \n\nI wanted to thank everyone for their responses and feedback. It great to see when a community comes together to support fellow Redditors.\n\nAdditional Info: I have had this plan for over a year, so I was past the initial 31 days. Some people may disagree with warranties/insurance programs, and it is true I have had some both good and bad experiences. But overall this is a success, there is no indication that my premium will go up. So at the end of the day this is a win.",

    "selftext": "So bought my steamdeck yesterday.. no issues with anything on Steam.. but I installed Heroic and installed a bunch of classics.. like Star Trek 25th Anniversary/DeusEX/Grimfandango/Blade runner/dungeon siege/might and magic 6.. etc.. just a bunch of oldies. Most of them don't run and some get into game and controllers/keyboard/mouse aren't configured and I can't get them to work.\n\nWatched a bunch of Youtube on how to install Heroic and get the games installed and available through the SteamOS which I did and they're all there ..  but nobody in those videos mentioned you'll be hard pressed to get any working. They all just say install Epic and play your gog games.  Anyone have experience with this.. I keep thinking there's a setting I missed.. like a proton or configuration setting I missed. \n\n   I plan on tinkering but thought I'd post here to see if anyone ran into this or know what or if I'm doing something wrong.",

I can send more details if interested.\n\nIf you want to install it on the deck go to linux desktop, download the game on moddb  https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/downloads/stalker-anomaly-153\n\n and follow this guide:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/s/Q07ZwMx0S3\nAfter that you can launch the game through steam and choose your compatibility layer and controls.\n\nI can share my control layout as well.\n\n It doesn't have native controller support but The steam controller input allows to double or triple bind controls/keys and the trackpad works great as mouse! \n\nPlayed the game about 20 hours now and it crashed 3 times, but that's it. \n\nHave fun!\n",

And I do still want to be safety minded for any risks there might be for things like that. But I'm also going through a lot of big life changes right now that having a little help from an at home assistant type device would be super helpful where I can just tell it a thing and it will remind me or add it to other devices and stuff like that. I'm also getting some home security stuff (free through my internet provider), but being able to connect all that stuff together or having all the devices stuff connected to my phone & the Alexa would be so helpful and maybe help me understand some of it a bit better. I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

Overall it works well, but it will go through phases where they are on all the time (and few times when they didn’t come on and sunset). \n\nI use the Kasa app for those but wanted to use Apple HomeKit for the coffee maker.

I can get them to all come back if I powercycle all of my Echos at the same time, but they start dropping off again within an hour.\n\nI'm at a dead-end as far as troubleshooting.  I have tried powercycling, reconfiguring, connecting things in a different order, etc.  I have factory reset everything in the entire system multiple times.  As I previously mentioned, all firmware is up to date.  If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'd be tearing my hair out if I had any left.  Thank you in advance.",

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

(and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

    "selftext": "My parents have a lovely little property with a garden and a few acres of land. It’s their pride and joy... they take care of it all themselves, from flower beds to chickens.\n\nBut lately I’ve noticed it’s becoming harder for them to keep track of everything.... Cars pull into the wrong driveway, random animals wander near the fence line, and sometimes packages get left at weird spots around the yard. Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar? Any recommendations for brands or setups that don’t need heavy installation or complicated apps?",

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "Good morning, I'm hoping to get some help.  I have been trying to get a stable home automation setup for over a year and I am at my wit's end.  \n  \n**My equipment:** (everything is updated to the latest firmware):  \n3 Amazon Echo 4th gens (which have a Thread border router)  \n20 Inovelli White series Matter/Thread dimmers  \n3 Nanoleaf smart bulbs  \n1 Eve Matter/Thread smart plug\n\n**My issue:** After setup, all my devices slowly start dropping from the network (showing as unavailable in the Alexa app), and after a day or two none of them work.  I can get them to all come back if I powercycle all of my Echos at the same time, but they start dropping off again within an hour.\n\nI'm at a dead-end as far as troubleshooting.  I have tried powercycling, reconfiguring, connecting things in a different order, etc.  I have factory reset everything in the entire system multiple times.  As I previously mentioned, all firmware is up to date.  If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'd be tearing my hair out if I had any left.  Thank you in advance.",

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Sure enough, I was prompted to login and it logged in successfully this time, and my device was listed. Hit the power button via the app and sure enough it went off.\n\nWent into SmartThings linked services and reconnected it successfully to the Sengled cloud. Device is now controllable again in Smartthings.\n\nI know most (if not all) people that have Sengled devices have moved on to non-cloud dependent devices, but figured anyone that still has a Sengled device and has been using the manual control button since their cloud service went offline, might want to know that it's back up again. Guess we'll see how long it lasts this time.\n\n  \nEdit: 10/20/2025 was when traffic started logging in my firewall again for the Sengled device.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI'm building a smart setup for my bedroom and here’s what I’ve picked so far:\n\n* Xiaomi Smart Ceiling Light D30\n* Aqara Smart Wall Switch H1 (No Neutral)\n* Aqara Hub E1\n\nEverything will be controlled through Mi Home, and/ or Apple Home as well.\n\nMy goal is to have full app control and some simple automations like:\n\n* after 8 PM, set a warmer light temperature;\n* in the morning, switch back to cool white;\n* maybe trigger different brightness levels via the wall switch.\n\nI’d really appreciate recommendations based on actual experience and quality:\n\n* is the Xiaomi D30 a good choice or should I look for a brighter/RGB model?\n* is there a better-performing or faster wall switch?\n* I’d also like a smart outlet that’s flat and matches the H1 design, ideally with a USB port. Any suggestions?\n\nI’ve read quite a few reviews saying Aqara can be hit-or-miss in smart setups (lag, stability, hub quirks). I’m open to solid alternatives available in Europe (EU versions). Please share your picks.  \n  \nLooking for a reliable setup with low latency and stable performance over time.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I have a large system that is a collection random smarthome products. I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

I dont really care what the time increment is. I just wanna be able to set it to dim on at x time and dim off at x time. I have cruised youtube and the google and have not found what I'm lookin for yet, i dont think. So i figured id come to the ole reddit and see if what I'm looking for even exists and if anyone has specific products they would suggest. ",

    "title": "Do motorized accordion blind retrofit kits exist?",
    "selftext": "We recently moved into a new place that has a number of large accordion blinds around the house. We would absolutely love to get these set up into our smart home system (Alexa currently, Home Assistant likely in the future) so that they can go up and down on a timer throughout the day. I've been trying to find a motorized retrofit system for them but haven't had any luck. I've found sets that will tilt horizontal blinds (these blinds don't have the twist rod), and others that will open curtains by running a motor across the top pole, but I can't seem to find any that are set up to pull the cords to open a standard set of blinds. If anybody happens to know if these exist and could let me know I would really appreciate it!",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

    "selftext": "Looking through my firewall logs this morning, I saw my singular Sengled device on the network and hitting some AWS destinations.\n\nI popped \"sengled\" into Google to see if there was any recent news. Browsed to their site (us.sengled.com) and they have an \"opening soon\" message that their store will be taking a break from 10/6 to 10/20 (already passed lol).\n\nI opened the Sengled app today for the first time in a month or 2, just to see if anything there had changed. Sure enough, I was prompted to login and it logged in successfully this time, and my device was listed. Hit the power button via the app and sure enough it went off.\n\nWent into SmartThings linked services and reconnected it successfully to the Sengled cloud. Device is now controllable again in Smartthings.\n\nI know most (if not all) people that have Sengled devices have moved on to non-cloud dependent devices, but figured anyone that still has a Sengled device and has been using the manual control button since their cloud service went offline, might want to know that it's back up again. Guess we'll see how long it lasts this time.\n\n  \nEdit: 10/20/2025 was when traffic started logging in my firewall again for the Sengled device.",

Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I’ve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I’m wondering if there’s a better alternative.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4–5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you’ve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn’t a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance — and if you’ve built something like this, I’d love to see your setup!",

(Some things are more comokicated but with enough time i can handle it) So i would love to have the visualisation over HA. \n\nBUT; What would be the best/easiest way to set up the rest/electricity? This should be more of an easy/straight forward thing. Should run when we move into the house. I can set the HA things later. \n\nI Thought KNX would be the way, but there are still a few disadvantages:\n\n- I cant program ETS by myself\n- I would like to have the main functions to work with KNX (heating, shading, lights, main door lock, garage door) to be controled over switches AND something like a Shelly walldisplay which should have all functions.\n\nSo my questions is:\n-Is it possible to control shading, main door lock etc. also over HA? (Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

I don’t need full remote control, just a simple solution that can handle this small motion—so I can avoid having to do it manually each time.\n\nHas anybody tried something similar or have any tips or suggestions for a device or hack I could use?

Sure enough, I was prompted to login and it logged in successfully this time, and my device was listed. Hit the power button via the app and sure enough it went off.\n\nWent into SmartThings linked services and reconnected it successfully to the Sengled cloud.

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

Also the mic on the headset stops working.\n\nThe only way to fix this is to delete the Realtek Audio Driver in Windows Device Managemant -> Search for Windows Updates -> it then says theres an update available because it spots the missing audio driver -> install update en restart PC.\n\nAfterwards audio works fine on both speakers and headset. This leads me to believe its a Realtek audio driver issue.\n\nAnyone has had similar issues or knows a fix that doesn't involve me reinstalling Realtek constantly?\n\nI'm on Windows 11 and using a Logitech Speaker set (connected through jack) and a Razer Barracuda X Chroma Wireless Headset (connected through Dongle).\n\nThings I tried that do not work:\n-replugging speakers and headset\n-updating realtek audio drivers\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi, I'm trying to use my HP Envy 360 from about 5 years ago on Windows 11to play lethal company with some friends, but every time I open the game, some Windows Driver Foundation thing starts taking up about 25% of my maximum CPU and slowing the laptop down drastically. I've tried disconnecting a second monitor as well as a microphone and USB mouse without much change. I also tried running sfc scannow and the dsim health cleaning commands which offered some help and fixed a couple things supposedly, but they haven't gotten rid of that driver issue. Chatgpt suggest I try to replace all of my graphics and audio drivers with some newer ones and also get a new BIOS update which all seems a bit drastic, especially considering that the HP website suggests that I don't need any driver updates right now after it scans my device. Does the AI really know what it's talking about or is there something just bad about how the game is designed or something. I go from about 20% CPU when looking at just task manager, to 90%+ when I open the game. It's not like it's GTA or something with a huge world, but maybe it's just not very optimized or something. Any suggestions?",

    "selftext": "So I have a hp laptop 15 fc0028AU (AMD Ryzen 5 7520U). So for context, my laptop only has 8 gb ram, and i really get chocked on ram when I try to run multiple apps, and last week, I heard someone mention linux as a great alternative (up until that point, I only knew linux existed, and didn't know much about it). So, i installed linux mint, along with windows. But due to some reason, the audio wasn't working on both OS, so, after researching on the internet, i did a lot of \"kernel\" level changes, but in the end, i somehow corrupted my windows. And after i deleted the linux, it got even more corrupted, and I got to a situation where I needed to reinstall windows via a clean install. \n\nThe problem is, as soon as I start the installation process via a usb drive, it shows the \"show hardware\" screen, which I cannot get past, even after a week. I searched everywhere. The official hp weboste lists every single driver except the storage driver for my model, and I even tried the AMD drivers for my processor, still no use. While researching, many people on reddit said that switching to another older version of win (5+5) and directly upgrading will solve this issue. So i tried that also, but no use. Nothing worked, the assistant failed, the media creation tool failed. Now, i am stuck on win (5+5).\n\nI have heard that the drivers for the same processer might work, even if they are from a different manufacturer, but I cannot find any that match mine (although I think this is due to my lack of knowledge on this topic, and not due to it being non-existent).\n\nSo, can somone please help me by telling me how to the driver",

    "title": "Crashing to either reboot or frozen screen in several games",
    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nSystem Specs:\n\nOS - Microsoft 10 ver. 10.0.19045 Build 19045\n\nMOBO - MSI B365M Pro-VH\n\nBIOS - ver. 1.60, 7/9/2024\n\nCPU - Intel i7-9700K\n\nGPU - RTX 5060 8Gb (GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 5060 WINDFORCE 8G Graphics Card)\n\nRAM - 32Gb DDR4 (CORSAIR Vengeance LPX DDR4 RAM 32GB (2x16GB))\n\nStorage: PNY CS900 500GB SSD for C drive and a Western Digital 1TB WD Blue M.2 for D drive\n\nPSU: MONTECH Century II - 850W 80 Plus Gold\n\nI have a UPS between the PC and the wall outlet as I live in an older house. \n\nThe issue:\n\nMy system was overheating real bad with my older set-up. I had an AIO for my CPU and a water-cooled 1080 for the GPU. The GPU started spiking into the 100s C and would throttle then power off my PC. I assumed it had reached its end so I went about updating to a new card. I also converted my case to air-cool only and added some more fans. I also replaced an old and poor reputation PSU for the one listed above. After this the temp issues seem to have been resolved but a new issue has started.\n\nThis problem is that (starting with Battlefield 6 and Helldivers 2) when gaming everything is going fine, loads and temps are fine (CPU loads are reaching the 90%s with temps in the 50s to 60s, GPU is reaching like 50%s and temps in the 50s), but then without a repeatable cause, the game will freeze, then either the PC will reboot or the game will remain frozen and I cannot access anything else and need to reboot anyways. The only easily repeatable error is from BF6 campaign, but there seems to be a lot of issues with that so I can't even guarantee that those crashes are related to these crashes. No BSODs no error messages. Event Viewer does not provide any conclusive error leading up to the crash. There are some warnings about file read errors but they are for other programs on my PC that seem to occur throughout the day. There are no .dmp files being generated for the crashes either. I've been watching my temps, utilization, etc. with different monitoring apps to see if there is a viewable issue, but there hasn't been a through line. Like the most recent crash occurred when the GPU hit 100% utilization, but this is the first time the crash coincided with that. Other times the GPU load could be at like 30% utilization and it will still crash.\n\nSteps taken already:\n\nI have tried running on the lowest settings, no change to crashing\n\nI have redownloaded the games and verified, no change\n\nI have updated and re-flashed the BIOS, the display drivers, peripheral drivers, no change\n\nI have checked drive health, both good\n\nI have run FurMark2, no issues arose and it handled it fine\n\nI have run some stress tests on the CPU, GPU, and RAM (for what I can do) using the tests provided by OCCT, and memtest with nothing being apparent\n\nThere's probably a couple other things I've forgotten as I have been trying to trouble shoot this for a good while now.\n\n  \nI can run other games fine like BG3 and F1, though I did have a crash in CK3 that I've never had before, but I can't guarantee that it was this issue as I am running mods on that. I have also experienced a similar crash in Cyber Punk so IDK.\n\n  \nAny help would be greatly appreciated, I am at my wits end and am trying to make things work before I have to go spend even more money to fix these problems as the only other thing I can think to do is just put in a new MB, CPU, and RAM but that's like another $500 I'm trying to avoid spending right now.\n\n  \nThanks in advance for the help.\n\n  \n",

I have been using it since 2011 and it worked fine until just a week ago it stopped booting windows and went straight to startup repair which then failed trying to do a startup repair like 7 times before eventually even startup repair didn't work anymore\n\nso I kept it inside bubble wrap and stored it in a low humidity area for around a week before my sata to USB dongle arrived. so I plugged in the dongle and tried to export stuff from file explorer, but windows didn't recognize it at all \n\nso I tried to boot Linux with the drive inserted but the whole sata bus crashed and Linux couldn't boot, just spammed errors line CommWake and UNC\n\nand so I decided to try using ddrescue to recover data. I booted kde first, then got the ddrescue command ready with the log file and everything, and was about to press enter the moment I plug the drive in, BUT...it took a turn. The drive wasn't recognized on Linux either. normally when I plug a drive in, sudo dmesg would show the drive name (sda, sdb, sdc, whatever) but this time, it didn't show at all so I couldnt find the drive letter to do any recovery \n\nso I decided to try and diagnose the issue and this is what I observed: when the drive is plugged in, i hear it spin up and unpark the head, then random hard drive noises(like the head seeking), then I hear a click, then after about 10-15 seconds the head parks and platter stops spinning. but the drive is still getting power, just that it stopped doing anything for some reason . all of this while not even being recognized in Linux or whatever. No scratching or grinding or rhythmic clicking or whatsoever, the only unusual click is that one click sound in between.\n\nis there ANY explanation to what's happening to my drive? could it be a PCB failure? Is there any way to fix this and recover the files on the drive? ",

    "selftext": "I have no idea what the hell is going on here, but for some reason one game on my PC just randomly decides to stop my PC from working. I've been through Microsoft support and other PC related subs, but I'm gonna try here as well since no fixes anywhere in those places have helped. First it was Hitman : WoA, now that game is fine (I have no idea why btw, it just stopped doing it one day) and its Powerwash Simulators turn.\n\nFor background, when I am playing the game everything is running fine, HWInfo shows no power issues, no temp issues and everything is cruisy. What then will suddenly happen, is my monitors will black screen but my PC will stay running. NOTHING I do in this state can get a response from my computer, its like my PC is in sleep mode, but everything barring my keyboard and monitors are still actively running. The only way to get my PC to reboot is to force a shutdown with the switch on the back.\n\nUpon now checking Event Viewer, there is no error to be seen besides a 6008 error, which denotes that the shutdown was unexpected, and a critical event 41 that states a Kernel-Power issue, but my power supply is plenty enough for what I'm running with it.\n\nFor my Specs i have:\n\nAMD 5950X CPU  \nNvidia 3060Ti GPU  \nB450M Mortar Max Motherboard   \nCorsair RM1000X PSU  \nCooler I'm not 100% on but its a Thermalright with 2 coils/fans. cools my CPU perfectly fine\n\nMy drivers are all up to date, no other game (barring Hitman before which magically fixed itself) has this issue. I have plenty of storage space and no malware or anything of the sort. The other issue is that sometimes I can play Powerwash for 8 hours a day for 3 days with no problems, then the next day I'll have 3 of these crashes in a day, its completely random.\n\n  \nHas ANYONE run into this same kind of issue before? I've been pulling my hair out between support pages and subs and it seems that this issue is exclusive to me, or no one has ever reported it before. If theres a way for me to get you more information, please let me know. I'll gladly dig through diagnostics tools/dump folders on my computer to find you the info you need\n\n",

    "selftext": "When working in Auto-Fan mode, I noticed that when switching to the operating mode of the RTX 3070ti video card coolers, one of the fans constantly starts spinning and stops. Works apart from others. This is very noticeable in the indicators in the program.\nOne of them either starts spinning later than everyone else, or faster than the other two. Moreover, the number of revolutions is always different, and because of this, there is a constant sound of a fading cooler. \n\nSurprisingly, if you do not work in Auto-Fan mode and set the settings so that the coolers work already at certain speeds, everything will work correctly. \n\nHowever, even in this case, I noticed a difference in speed between the coolers, albeit a minimal one:\nThe rpm of the two coolers is always constant - 1256/1256 or 825/825. \nBut one of them (the most extreme) always has, for some reason, always, albeit minimally, a different rpm. For example, when both coolers have 1256 rpm, he will have 1250, or when they have  1520 rpm, he will have 1518.\n\nIs there any suggestion what it might be? Can you give me some minimally simple tips that could fix this ailment? I will accept anything from simple methods to visiting a repair service.\n\nI use a translator, so I'm sorry if I can't always understand the answer.\n\n",

And then the sata; also connected the aforementioned disconnected sata to the corrupt drive.

Same cables do work for my laptop.\n\nI disconnected cables from both HDD, same no signal; Monitor does detect which input is connected and it auto switches to that say when I connect DP it switches to DP. My gpu fan starts when I press power key but goes off after that.\n\nI tried shorting CLR and RST using jumpers to reset motherboard no luck.\n\nIt booted once among all that, but when I connected the drive it crashed and now it's no booting up, not even motherboard screen.\n\n\nAny possible solutions?

I had to hard reset the whole pc in order for it to work again but after loading up a game again it crashed again. So a few times i hard resetted and each time it crashed especially under load (though a couple of times it happened on the desktop), and it happened faster and faster until i could barely get a signal out.\n\nOh well, i went all the troubleshooting and after testing it on another system with furmark, still same issue. No biggie, i sent the card back and the company sent a new one and it arrived yesterday.\n\nSince then i have changed my psu from a deepcool 750pf to a thermaltake toughpower gt2 snow just for ease of mind. \n\nIt's been working fine all day (furmark test passed, battlefield 6, monster hunter wilds...) but i can't help but feel worried this might also break again. So i was wondering, what are the chances my motherboard could have killed and will kill the gpu? I know my old psu was trash and could have been part of the problem but, i can't help but feel worried everytime i run a game. Pcie slot looks fine, Voltage seems good too for now, temperarure is great.\n\nCan i rest easy? Or is it possible my motherboard could ruin the gpu?\n\nI also want to add that either my old psu or gpu had a pretty noticeable coil whine (couldn't tell from where it came) which would click and stop as soon as i lost signal. Fans and leds keep going normally afterwards",

I got it because 1) needed an upgrade 2) I have a laptop and a PC and having a wireless mouse that can work on both devices is a huge win.\n\nIssue I am experiencing is that when on my PC, the mouse is connected via USB Receiver that is plugged directly into the back of my PC. It happened as well with my old Wireless Mouse Logitech Lift.\n\nWhen it happened previously I just disconnected it all together and plugged in my spare wired mouse. But having a wired mouse and a Bluetooth mouse is ridiculous.\n\nAny ideas and troubleshooting would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI have Uninstalled and Reinstalled. My laptop is a MacBook and it works seamlessly.\n\nWhen playing Sims the latency is insane, as well as when booting up programs it will lag like crazy. I know its a PC issue but I don't know where to start so any and all advice is deeply appreciated!\n\nThank youuuu!!\n\n  \nEDIT because I forgot to mention:\n\nI have Logi Options+. Program is up-to-date and Firmware is up-to-date.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I am currently trying to free up some space on my laptop and ran into a bit of a problem that I am unsure how to solve. As I was dragging and dropping specific files (slow process, I know, I just like to be sure I don't accidentally delete the wrong one) I dragged and dropped my Desktop application(?) to my actual desktop. I now have a Desktop folder on my desktop. Is this okay to delete? Or will it massively mess up my laptop? For reference, and sorry for how poor my wording is, I'm not a techy person, when I open my File Explorer it shows the little blue desktop icon and under that a folder labeled \"Desktop\" which I don't want to have (made today, by accident) TL;DR, can I delete the desktop folder without deleting the actual application/shortcut/whatever.",

We were told that the new house’s system will be compatible and all I had to do was plug the modem in it and it would set itself up automatically since I preplanned the date to transfer the service. The problem I’ve run into is I don’t know a single thing about wifi/internet. The modem has to plug into an outlet and a coax cable but the only place I can find a coax cable in the house it connected to absolutely nothing and I don’t know how to set it up. My fiancée works from home and we need wifi asap but can’t get a technician for over 2 weeks from now. If you have any help I’m all ears. \n\nImportant notes:\n- only findable coax cable is by the junction box, and neither end leads anywhere. In other words nothing is connected and setup. \n\n- I have a rogers xfinity gateway modem gen 3. \n\n- yes bringing the modem with me is okay, I’ve done it before and the house was setup correct and it worked fine. \n\n- I don’t know what I’m doing lol. I have pictures if it helps just let me know. ",

    "selftext": "I currently have optimum fiber, 2 gb plan. For the life of me i couldn't understand why streaming was so choppy, then i realized i have crazy buffer bloat(upload and download latencies reaching 1000's). I have a modem/router combo(XSR 250 GK) which if i'm not mistaken acts as a sort of ONT as well. Gives ridiculous buffer bloat. It was provided to me by Optimum.\n\nI then placed the modem/router combo provided by optimum in bridge mode- then attached an EERO 7 router to it to use as a stand alone router. I thought it would fix it- didn't help at all. Wired or wireless, buffer bloat persists, close or far from router, buffer bloat persists. \n\nI have tried everything and am so done with this terrible service. Im getting around 2 gb download and upload speed when wired, and 1.2-1.5 gb wireless- which is fantastic for what I need. But the upload and download latency is TERRIBLE- mostly upload but sometimes download. I do online gaming after work for context- but I can't even enjoy that anymore\n\n I can't change the bandwith limit on either my modem/router combo or my EERO. Im trying to decide what to do. I can't get rid of the modem/router combo i dont think, because it acts as an ONT router and modem. I also dont think the problem is the EERO. I even connected directly to the gateway wired, and internet speeds still showed buffer bloat. \n\nI wonder if there is a hardware issue, maybe something is comprimised? My eero is receiving 2.3 gb to the gateway- so doesnt seem to be an issue there. Does the modem/router combo quality affect the performance of my EERO? I simply can't identify the bottleneck. Wired Gives me 1.9 gb. Just latency.\n\nIm planning on call a technican to come out, but i don't even know what to ask him for.I have truly have no idea how to get rid of Buffer Bloat. I would be unbelievably grateful for any help.",

As I am not too savvy with my hardware. But! Onto what I actually needed help with, it appears one of my gaming services (Ubisoft) isn’t working at the moment. It keeps saying ‘Connection lost’ when it is VERY MUCH NOT A CONNECTION ISSUE. My connection is completely fine and strong as I am directly next to my WiFi router.  \n\n(Very long, optional reading)\n\nWhat I am experiencing in the best detail possible, is the screen of navy blue stating precisely this ‘Connection lost, we are currently unable to connect, but you can continue playing offline or try again’ Shorter answer, I have tried again, and I have tried ‘playing offline’ which DOES NOT WORK. Despite its words I have been deceived, offline mode doesn’t allow me to even get into the game or Ubisoft, and retrying just wastes 2 minutes of my life for it to do absolutely nothing. As for ‘Back’ and ‘Settings’ all settings does is asks me my language preference and do a big fat NOTHING. Then back just takes me to login which also does ✨nothing✨ other than make my temper flare up. And then clicking ‘Can’t log in?’ Just takes me to a support page that eternally loads, then doesn’t have information regarding my issue. My WiFi is at full speed, and I can go to any other website and game. Just not Ubisoft or frontiers of Pandora. (The game I’m intending to play, btw please play the blue people game it’s sosososos awesome if you like the movies.) \n\nBUT ANYWAY. Back to the topic at hand if my needless hyperfixations wouldn’t get in the way of things for 20 minutes. \n\nMy computer is an ASUS ROG GM700, and is BRAND NEW. Not even a year old. Maybe 3-4 months old.\n\nIn short, h e l p. I’m a very, very stupid person who needs assistance about their computer being a whiny little piece of work.",

    "title": "BSOD problems have been occurring for a year now",
    "selftext": "I will try to add as much information as possible without dragging it on for too long.  \nI started getting fairly frequent BSODs last year around december(every 24-48hrs), the BSODs didn't have much consistency and were always different but repeating the same 5-7 error codes. I saw my C drive SSD health was pretty low and finally got a new one around this yr's April. The BSOD stopped for a bit but started again.\n\nHere are the list of errors I have gotten over the past few months:  \n\\-kernel security check failure  \n\\-apex index mismatch  \n\\-system service exception, it also said \"what failed: Ntfs.Sys\"  \n\\-memory managements  \n\\-kernel auto boost lock aquisition with raised IRQL  \n\\-Quota Underflow  \n\\-dpc watchdog violation\n\nHere are a few things to know about the pc and some behaviour I have noticed:  \n\\-I use ghostspectre OS, which is a lightweight windows without all the bloatware. I was getting bsods before i installed this new OS but that was also when I had the low health ssd  \n\\-I use 2 monitors; 75hz and 60hz. My gpu only has 1 hdmi port and rest are display. I have 2 cables; hdmi-hdmi and a display-hdmi one. When I have my 75hz monitor plugged via hdmi-hdmi, i used to get frequent black screen. The monitor wouldn't turn off, just the pixels would go black and then come back after a second or 2. This would happen once or twice consecutively every few hours.  \n\\-I tried switching the cables for the 2 monitors, so now my 75hz monitor was using the hdmi-display cable, i no longer have the black screen problem but rarely the monitor turns off now, and this time actually turns off for a second. Sidenote, using this cable maximizes my 75hz monitor refresh rate to 60hz not sure why.  \n\\-I reset my BIOS, which surprisingly stopped the bsod for a week or more. But it slowly got more gradual. I tried resetting it again but this time it made no difference.  \n\\-I had a faulty SSD for a while(not C drive), it would not be able to write or read properly but that is now sorted. Not sure if that damaged something else somehow  \n\\-There are fairly frequent power outages where I live, and I dont have a UPS. So maybe that caused some internal issue  \n\\-I have noticed my new ssd(c drive) health gone down to 96% over the past few months, i can only imagine its just a side effect of all the crashing and power outage?  \n\\-I had 4 sticks of 2 different kinds of ram(2x8 and 2x16), the 16 gb ones was faster but the people at the store told me he matched the speeds to my old ram sticks so there shouldn't be any issues. Regardless, since i started getting bsods, i have tried only keeping one type of stick in there, but the issue still persists, unless a single stick is damaged from each type then i dont know.  \n\\-After installing new nvidia drivers 2 months back my screen was full black after starting up my pc. I had to open task manager with keybinds and try to fix it but it didn't work. I eventually rolled back drivers through the \"blue screen\", the screen that u kinda see when you are first starting up your pc and it gives u a bunch of options sorry idk what its called exactly, regardless that fixed it.  \n\\-I then installed older nvidia drivers back upto february cuz i couldn't find older, and have geforce installed instead of their nvidia app in case that was causing it  \n\\-me and a friend tried reading the dmp files but we couldn't get much out of that, i can send them but i feel like that might have some serious privacy concerns? idk  \n\\- I also play a lot of games and work extensively with 3d softwares. Theres no pattern to the bsod like when the scene gets too heavy it crashes; nothing like that.  \n\\-currently there's not much of a proper timeframe either for when it happens. Usually its around every 24 hrs or so, but i have also gotten 2 bsods in an hour back to back and so on so there's really no telling.  \n\\-also ran some hardware and memory tests in BurnInTest and also windows memory diagnostic tool and nothing popped up\n\nMy current pc specs are:  \nryzen5 3500x  \nRTX 3060  \n32gb RAM  \n256gb ssd(c drive)  \n4tb hdd  \n1tb ssd\n\nWould really appreciate some help, have been stuck with this for a while.",

A while ago my ex-partner used his phone and email as a method to recover my Google account (he controlled me a lot). Now she has passed away and her number has been deactivated; Furthermore, I do not have access to the recovery email and I have no way to contact his family.\n\nI have the correct password, but when I start the recovery process and enter the number or data I remember, Google considers it insufficient and does not ask me the following questions or give me access. At another time I found a link that took me to a form where one can explain the situation to Google and leave a current email for the response, but I can't find it anymore.\n\nI need access because important documents and personal data are there.

    "title": "5 year old unopened iPads won't charge. Is there any reasonable hope?",
    "selftext": "Back in 2020, we purchased about 100 iPads for one reason or another. I think something to do with Telehealth. Most of them were used and rolled out to the world, with no problems. \n\nNow it's late 2025, and we have about 20 iPads that we haven't taken out of the box yet. Of these, I believe so far we've found 6 iPads that refuse to turn on and stay on. \n\nWhen plugged into the stock charger (these are older gen 2 pro iPads, so they came with Apple Chargers), they will show the Apple logo for about 3-5 seconds, before it goes away, seemingly turning off, pausing for another 3-5 seconds, and showing the Apple logo again. Not my video, but it looks like this [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U\\_wjIpfyXE8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U_wjIpfyXE8) but with a white logo on black background and a different model iPad\n\nSince I have so many brokenish iPads, my coworkers and I have been able to try a few things.   \nFirst, I tried overnight charging with the stock charger.   \nI tried overnight with a faster charger, which was a laptop charger.   \nI tried overnight with a slower charger, which is the USB port on my computer. \n\nThen I tried booting into recovery mode (I believe called DFU mode). I do this a lot, I'm familiar with how the process works.   \nWhen trying to use my desktop to do this, it isn't even getting enough power to show the little computer and plug symbols.   \nWhen trying to boot into recovery while plugged into the wall with the stock charger, it will show the symbol and it will stay on (more on that next), but obviously I can't restore the iPad if I'm plugged up to the wall.   \nNext I tried recovery mode from a laptop that has a thunderbolt port, which seems to have more power in the USB port than my desktop. This would briefly flip to showing the computer and plug symbol, before turning itself off and back on to the Apple symbol. \n\nThe laptop also had one of those ports with a battery+ symbol, but it seemed to power the iPad less than the Thunderbolt port.   \nI also had a powered dock, with the same battery+ symbol that behaved the same. \n\nSince the iPad will seemingly stay on for a few minutes when in recovery mode, I also tried leaving it there for a few minutes. Normal iPad behavior turns that off after a few minutes, and this does the same, putting it back in the bootloop. \n\n  \nWe believe the problem is that the iPad is so dead that it can't start the firmware needed to properly initiate charging. A potential solution to this would be a jumpstart, but not only would we not know how to do this, but it could be dangerous. The other solution would be to take the battery out, charge it externally, and put it back together. We have a lot of iPads that are broken, however, and no experience doing this. Assuming it's even possible. ",

    "selftext": "Hi, I'm trying to use my HP Envy 360 from about 5 years ago on Windows 11to play lethal company with some friends, but every time I open the game, some Windows Driver Foundation thing starts taking up about 25% of my maximum CPU and slowing the laptop down drastically. I've tried disconnecting a second monitor as well as a microphone and USB mouse without much change. I also tried running sfc scannow and the dsim health cleaning commands which offered some help and fixed a couple things supposedly, but they haven't gotten rid of that driver issue. Chatgpt suggest I try to replace all of my graphics and audio drivers with some newer ones and also get a new BIOS update which all seems a bit drastic, especially considering that the HP website suggests that I don't need any driver updates right now after it scans my device. Does the AI really know what it's talking about or is there something just bad about how the game is designed or something. I go from about 20% CPU when looking at just task manager, to 90%+ when I open the game. It's not like it's GTA or something with a huge world, but maybe it's just not very optimized or something.

So, i installed linux mint, along with windows. But due to some reason, the audio wasn't working on both OS, so, after researching on the internet, i did a lot of \"kernel\" level changes, but in the end, i somehow corrupted my windows. And after i deleted the linux, it got even more corrupted, and I got to a situation where I needed to reinstall windows via a clean install. \n\nThe problem is, as soon as I start the installation process via a usb drive, it shows the \"show hardware\" screen, which I cannot get past, even after a week. I searched everywhere. The official hp weboste lists every single driver except the storage driver for my model, and I even tried the AMD drivers for my processor, still no use. While researching, many people on reddit said that switching to another older version of win (5+5) and directly upgrading will solve this issue. So i tried that also, but no use. Nothing worked, the assistant failed, the media creation tool failed. Now, i am stuck on win (5+5).\n\nI have heard that the drivers for the same processer might work, even if they are from a different manufacturer, but I cannot find any that match mine (although I think this is due to my lack of knowledge on this topic, and not due to it being non-existent).\n\nSo, can somone please help me by telling me how to the driver",

I pick up the phone from the charger in the morning, I charge overnight because I'm busy most of the time. But now when I pick it up from the charger its usually between 40 and 60.

    "title": "Crashing to either reboot or frozen screen in several games",
    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nSystem Specs:\n\nOS - Microsoft 10 ver. 10.0.19045 Build 19045\n\nMOBO - MSI B365M Pro-VH\n\nBIOS - ver. 1.60, 7/9/2024\n\nCPU - Intel i7-9700K\n\nGPU - RTX 5060 8Gb (GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 5060 WINDFORCE 8G Graphics Card)\n\nRAM - 32Gb DDR4 (CORSAIR Vengeance LPX DDR4 RAM 32GB (2x16GB))\n\nStorage: PNY CS900 500GB SSD for C drive and a Western Digital 1TB WD Blue M.2 for D drive\n\nPSU: MONTECH Century II - 850W 80 Plus Gold\n\nI have a UPS between the PC and the wall outlet as I live in an older house. \n\nThe issue:\n\nMy system was overheating real bad with my older set-up. I had an AIO for my CPU and a water-cooled 1080 for the GPU. The GPU started spiking into the 100s C and would throttle then power off my PC. I assumed it had reached its end so I went about updating to a new card. I also converted my case to air-cool only and added some more fans. I also replaced an old and poor reputation PSU for the one listed above. After this the temp issues seem to have been resolved but a new issue has started.\n\nThis problem is that (starting with Battlefield 6 and Helldivers 2) when gaming everything is going fine, loads and temps are fine (CPU loads are reaching the 90%s with temps in the 50s to 60s, GPU is reaching like 50%s and temps in the 50s), but then without a repeatable cause, the game will freeze, then either the PC will reboot or the game will remain frozen and I cannot access anything else and need to reboot anyways. The only easily repeatable error is from BF6 campaign, but there seems to be a lot of issues with that so I can't even guarantee that those crashes are related to these crashes. No BSODs no error messages. Event Viewer does not provide any conclusive error leading up to the crash. There are some warnings about file read errors but they are for other programs on my PC that seem to occur throughout the day. There are no .dmp files being generated for the crashes either. I've been watching my temps, utilization, etc. with different monitoring apps to see if there is a viewable issue, but there hasn't been a through line. Like the most recent crash occurred when the GPU hit 100% utilization, but this is the first time the crash coincided with that. Other times the GPU load could be at like 30% utilization and it will still crash.\n\nSteps taken already:\n\nI have tried running on the lowest settings, no change to crashing\n\nI have redownloaded the games and verified, no change\n\nI have updated and re-flashed the BIOS, the display drivers, peripheral drivers, no change\n\nI have checked drive health, both good\n\nI have run FurMark2, no issues arose and it handled it fine\n\nI have run some stress tests on the CPU, GPU, and RAM (for what I can do) using the tests provided by OCCT, and memtest with nothing being apparent\n\nThere's probably a couple other things I've forgotten as I have been trying to trouble shoot this for a good while now.\n\n  \nI can run other games fine like BG3 and F1, though I did have a crash in CK3 that I've never had before, but I can't guarantee that it was this issue as I am running mods on that. I have also experienced a similar crash in Cyber Punk so IDK.\n\n  \nAny help would be greatly appreciated, I am at my wits end and am trying to make things work before I have to go spend even more money to fix these problems as the only other thing I can think to do is just put in a new MB, CPU, and RAM but that's like another $500 I'm trying to avoid spending right now.\n\n  \nThanks in advance for the help.\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Do you guys know what is happening to my WD Scorpio Blue 750gb? I have been using it since 2011 and it worked fine until just a week ago it stopped booting windows and went straight to startup repair which then failed trying to do a startup repair like 7 times before eventually even startup repair didn't work anymore\n\nso I kept it inside bubble wrap and stored it in a low humidity area for around a week before my sata to USB dongle arrived. so I plugged in the dongle and tried to export stuff from file explorer, but windows didn't recognize it at all \n\nso I tried to boot Linux with the drive inserted but the whole sata bus crashed and Linux couldn't boot, just spammed errors line CommWake and UNC\n\nand so I decided to try using ddrescue to recover data. I booted kde first, then got the ddrescue command ready with the log file and everything, and was about to press enter the moment I plug the drive in, BUT...it took a turn. The drive wasn't recognized on Linux either. normally when I plug a drive in, sudo dmesg would show the drive name (sda, sdb, sdc, whatever) but this time, it didn't show at all so I couldnt find the drive letter to do any recovery \n\nso I decided to try and diagnose the issue and this is what I observed: when the drive is plugged in, i hear it spin up and unpark the head, then random hard drive noises(like the head seeking), then I hear a click, then after about 10-15 seconds the head parks and platter stops spinning. but the drive is still getting power, just that it stopped doing anything for some reason . all of this while not even being recognized in Linux or whatever. No scratching or grinding or rhythmic clicking or whatsoever, the only unusual click is that one click sound in between.\n\nis there ANY explanation to what's happening to my drive? could it be a PCB failure? Is there any way to fix this and recover the files on the drive? ",

    "selftext": "I have no idea what the hell is going on here, but for some reason one game on my PC just randomly decides to stop my PC from working. I've been through Microsoft support and other PC related subs, but I'm gonna try here as well since no fixes anywhere in those places have helped. First it was Hitman : WoA, now that game is fine (I have no idea why btw, it just stopped doing it one day) and its Powerwash Simulators turn.\n\nFor background, when I am playing the game everything is running fine, HWInfo shows no power issues, no temp issues and everything is cruisy. What then will suddenly happen, is my monitors will black screen but my PC will stay running. NOTHING I do in this state can get a response from my computer, its like my PC is in sleep mode, but everything barring my keyboard and monitors are still actively running. The only way to get my PC to reboot is to force a shutdown with the switch on the back.\n\nUpon now checking Event Viewer, there is no error to be seen besides a 6008 error, which denotes that the shutdown was unexpected, and a critical event 41 that states a Kernel-Power issue, but my power supply is plenty enough for what I'm running with it.\n\nFor my Specs i have:\n\nAMD 5950X CPU  \nNvidia 3060Ti GPU  \nB450M Mortar Max Motherboard   \nCorsair RM1000X PSU  \nCooler I'm not 100% on but its a Thermalright with 2 coils/fans. cools my CPU perfectly fine\n\nMy drivers are all up to date, no other game (barring Hitman before which magically fixed itself) has this issue. I have plenty of storage space and no malware or anything of the sort. The other issue is that sometimes I can play Powerwash for 8 hours a day for 3 days with no problems, then the next day I'll have 3 of these crashes in a day, its completely random.\n\n  \nHas ANYONE run into this same kind of issue before? I've been pulling my hair out between support pages and subs and it seems that this issue is exclusive to me, or no one has ever reported it before. If theres a way for me to get you more information, please let me know. I'll gladly dig through diagnostics tools/dump folders on my computer to find you the info you need\n\n",

    "selftext": "When working in Auto-Fan mode, I noticed that when switching to the operating mode of the RTX 3070ti video card coolers, one of the fans constantly starts spinning and stops. Works apart from others. This is very noticeable in the indicators in the program.\nOne of them either starts spinning later than everyone else, or faster than the other two. Moreover, the number of revolutions is always different, and because of this, there is a constant sound of a fading cooler. \n\nSurprisingly, if you do not work in Auto-Fan mode and set the settings so that the coolers work already at certain speeds, everything will work correctly. \n\nHowever, even in this case, I noticed a difference in speed between the coolers, albeit a minimal one:\nThe rpm of the two coolers is always constant - 1256/1256 or 825/825. \nBut one of them (the most extreme) always has, for some reason, always, albeit minimally, a different rpm. For example, when both coolers have 1256 rpm, he will have 1250, or when they have  1520 rpm, he will have 1518.\n\nIs there any suggestion what it might be? Can you give me some minimally simple tips that could fix this ailment? I will accept anything from simple methods to visiting a repair service.\n\nI use a translator, so I'm sorry if I can't always understand the answer.\n\n",

As of October 2025, every time I log into Windows, I receive a critical error message titled \"We can't sign in to your account.\" The full message warns that \"This problem can often be fixed by signing out of your account and then signing back in. If you don't sign out now, any files you create or changes you make will be lost.\" . This red-box error has been popping up consistently, indicating that I'm being logged into a temporary profile instead of my actual user account, which means none of my personal files or settings are available. My setup is a dual-boot configuration, with Linux installed alongside Windows 11. I have already attempted the most common and basic troubleshooting steps, including multiple PC restarts and performing the suggested sign out and sign in cycles, but the system continues to load into this temporary profile. I need assistance figuring out the next steps, as simple fixes aren't working. This is happening on my HP laptop.",

    "title": "5 year old unopened iPads won't charge. Is there any reasonable hope?",
    "selftext": "Back in 2020, we purchased about 100 iPads for one reason or another. I think something to do with Telehealth. Most of them were used and rolled out to the world, with no problems. \n\nNow it's late 2025, and we have about 20 iPads that we haven't taken out of the box yet. Of these, I believe so far we've found 6 iPads that refuse to turn on and stay on. \n\nWhen plugged into the stock charger (these are older gen 2 pro iPads, so they came with Apple Chargers), they will show the Apple logo for about 3-5 seconds, before it goes away, seemingly turning off, pausing for another 3-5 seconds, and showing the Apple logo again. Not my video, but it looks like this [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U\\_wjIpfyXE8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U_wjIpfyXE8) but with a white logo on black background and a different model iPad\n\nSince I have so many brokenish iPads, my coworkers and I have been able to try a few things.   \nFirst, I tried overnight charging with the stock charger.   \nI tried overnight with a faster charger, which was a laptop charger.   \nI tried overnight with a slower charger, which is the USB port on my computer. \n\nThen I tried booting into recovery mode (I believe called DFU mode). I do this a lot, I'm familiar with how the process works.   \nWhen trying to use my desktop to do this, it isn't even getting enough power to show the little computer and plug symbols.   \nWhen trying to boot into recovery while plugged into the wall with the stock charger, it will show the symbol and it will stay on (more on that next), but obviously I can't restore the iPad if I'm plugged up to the wall.   \nNext I tried recovery mode from a laptop that has a thunderbolt port, which seems to have more power in the USB port than my desktop. This would briefly flip to showing the computer and plug symbol, before turning itself off and back on to the Apple symbol. \n\nThe laptop also had one of those ports with a battery+ symbol, but it seemed to power the iPad less than the Thunderbolt port.   \nI also had a powered dock, with the same battery+ symbol that behaved the same. \n\nSince the iPad will seemingly stay on for a few minutes when in recovery mode, I also tried leaving it there for a few minutes. Normal iPad behavior turns that off after a few minutes, and this does the same, putting it back in the bootloop. \n\n  \nWe believe the problem is that the iPad is so dead that it can't start the firmware needed to properly initiate charging. A potential solution to this would be a jumpstart, but not only would we not know how to do this, but it could be dangerous. The other solution would be to take the battery out, charge it externally, and put it back together. We have a lot of iPads that are broken, however, and no experience doing this. Assuming it's even possible. ",

    "selftext": "Hi, I'm trying to use my HP Envy 360 from about 5 years ago on Windows 11to play lethal company with some friends, but every time I open the game, some Windows Driver Foundation thing starts taking up about 25% of my maximum CPU and slowing the laptop down drastically. I've tried disconnecting a second monitor as well as a microphone and USB mouse without much change. I also tried running sfc scannow and the dsim health cleaning commands which offered some help and fixed a couple things supposedly, but they haven't gotten rid of that driver issue. Chatgpt suggest I try to replace all of my graphics and audio drivers with some newer ones and also get a new BIOS update which all seems a bit drastic, especially considering that the HP website suggests that I don't need any driver updates right now after it scans my device. Does the AI really know what it's talking about or is there something just bad about how the game is designed or something. I go from about 20% CPU when looking at just task manager, to 90%+ when I open the game. It's not like it's GTA or something with a huge world, but maybe it's just not very optimized or something. Any suggestions?",

So, i installed linux mint, along with windows. But due to some reason, the audio wasn't working on both OS, so, after researching on the internet, i did a lot of \"kernel\" level changes, but in the end, i somehow corrupted my windows. And after i deleted the linux, it got even more corrupted, and I got to a situation where I needed to reinstall windows via a clean install. \n\nThe problem is, as soon as I start the installation process via a usb drive, it shows the \"show hardware\" screen, which I cannot get past, even after a week. I searched everywhere. The official hp weboste lists every single driver except the storage driver for my model, and I even tried the AMD drivers for my processor, still no use. While researching, many people on reddit said that switching to another older version of win (5+5) and directly upgrading will solve this issue. So i tried that also, but no use. Nothing worked, the assistant failed, the media creation tool failed. Now, i am stuck on win (5+5).\n\nI have heard that the drivers for the same processer might work, even if they are from a different manufacturer, but I cannot find any that match mine (although I think this is due to my lack of knowledge on this topic, and not due to it being non-existent).\n\nSo, can somone please help me by telling me how to the driver",

    "title": "Crashing to either reboot or frozen screen in several games",
    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nSystem Specs:\n\nOS - Microsoft 10 ver. 10.0.19045 Build 19045\n\nMOBO - MSI B365M Pro-VH\n\nBIOS - ver. 1.60, 7/9/2024\n\nCPU - Intel i7-9700K\n\nGPU - RTX 5060 8Gb (GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 5060 WINDFORCE 8G Graphics Card)\n\nRAM - 32Gb DDR4 (CORSAIR Vengeance LPX DDR4 RAM 32GB (2x16GB))\n\nStorage: PNY CS900 500GB SSD for C drive and a Western Digital 1TB WD Blue M.2 for D drive\n\nPSU: MONTECH Century II - 850W 80 Plus Gold\n\nI have a UPS between the PC and the wall outlet as I live in an older house. \n\nThe issue:\n\nMy system was overheating real bad with my older set-up. I had an AIO for my CPU and a water-cooled 1080 for the GPU. The GPU started spiking into the 100s C and would throttle then power off my PC. I assumed it had reached its end so I went about updating to a new card. I also converted my case to air-cool only and added some more fans. I also replaced an old and poor reputation PSU for the one listed above. After this the temp issues seem to have been resolved but a new issue has started.\n\nThis problem is that (starting with Battlefield 6 and Helldivers 2) when gaming everything is going fine, loads and temps are fine (CPU loads are reaching the 90%s with temps in the 50s to 60s, GPU is reaching like 50%s and temps in the 50s), but then without a repeatable cause, the game will freeze, then either the PC will reboot or the game will remain frozen and I cannot access anything else and need to reboot anyways. The only easily repeatable error is from BF6 campaign, but there seems to be a lot of issues with that so I can't even guarantee that those crashes are related to these crashes. No BSODs no error messages. Event Viewer does not provide any conclusive error leading up to the crash. There are some warnings about file read errors but they are for other programs on my PC that seem to occur throughout the day. There are no .dmp files being generated for the crashes either. I've been watching my temps, utilization, etc. with different monitoring apps to see if there is a viewable issue, but there hasn't been a through line. Like the most recent crash occurred when the GPU hit 100% utilization, but this is the first time the crash coincided with that. Other times the GPU load could be at like 30% utilization and it will still crash.\n\nSteps taken already:\n\nI have tried running on the lowest settings, no change to crashing\n\nI have redownloaded the games and verified, no change\n\nI have updated and re-flashed the BIOS, the display drivers, peripheral drivers, no change\n\nI have checked drive health, both good\n\nI have run FurMark2, no issues arose and it handled it fine\n\nI have run some stress tests on the CPU, GPU, and RAM (for what I can do) using the tests provided by OCCT, and memtest with nothing being apparent\n\nThere's probably a couple other things I've forgotten as I have been trying to trouble shoot this for a good while now.\n\n  \nI can run other games fine like BG3 and F1, though I did have a crash in CK3 that I've never had before, but I can't guarantee that it was this issue as I am running mods on that. I have also experienced a similar crash in Cyber Punk so IDK.\n\n  \nAny help would be greatly appreciated, I am at my wits end and am trying to make things work before I have to go spend even more money to fix these problems as the only other thing I can think to do is just put in a new MB, CPU, and RAM but that's like another $500 I'm trying to avoid spending right now.\n\n  \nThanks in advance for the help.\n\n  \n",

A restart usually fixed that\n\nWhen it didn't I put the DP cable into my motherboard and it works 100% of the times, so I updated the drivers, reconnected to my GPU and it didn't cause trouble since. So for about 2 months now.\n\nThis morning I tried to launch the PC as always but I cannot get any GPU display no matter what, can't even reach the BIOS, the motherboard connection always gives display, so I updated the nvidia drivers again using the motherboard connection, switching to the GPU gives no display. \n\nAnything I should check before sending it to the warranty? I still have it to the end of the year. Sadly opening the PC physically voids the warranty, there's like a tape there.\n\nEdit:\n\nImportant to mention that the GPU has 3 DP connections and all of them act the same",
