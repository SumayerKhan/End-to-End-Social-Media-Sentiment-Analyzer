    "selftext": "For the past 3 months I have been working on this IOS calculator app to make it look and feel like no other calculator and offer features that no other calculator does.\n\nEvery buttons shadow and animation is was handcrafted and no external assets were used. The button press haptics are tuned to make it feel like a you are pressing a real button.\n\nThe features that make **Calki** stand out are the following:  \n\\- Add context to your calculation by labelling the calculation and sharing the labeled calculation.  \n\\- You can even label each number in a calculation for later reference and even share the calculation with the explanation.  \n\\- A favourite function which is the memory function of the standard calculator but more intuitive, this allows you to save number for later use, and you can name the numbers as well.  \n\\- There are themes for you to choose as well, the Retro theme is near completion and other themes are works in progress.\n\nI would like for you to try it out. It is available for free on Appstore at:  \n[https://apps.apple.com/in/app/calki/id6747059181](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/calki/id6747059181)\n\nIf you could please provide feedback and also what features you would like the app to have, it would be great.\n\nThank you",

    "selftext": "> macOS 26.0 is continuing to appear more often with 28.61% as of end of September 2025. In our dataset, it had a spike to almost 40% in the middle of September, but came back a bit after that.\n\nCompare to macOS 15 which exactly one year ago had 50% of the market share. \n\nObviously, it is just a subset. But the drop from 40 to 30% is pretty significant even for that subset. (Based on https://telemetrydeck.com/platforms/swift/ - 6,280 apps use it, but that includes macOS and iOS apps)\n\nPS. I am a macOS indie app developer, but I personally do not use TelemetryDeck and I am not in any way related to them. Just found this data being really interesting, so decided to share.  ",

    "title": "iPhone & Wi-Fi 7",
    "selftext": "> For those unaware, Apple claims that the iPhone 16 and 17 series support 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), but in practice this is **highly limited** compared with the full standard.  \n>  \n> **Wi-Fi 7’s most important technical features include:**  \n>  \n> • **Up to 240 MHz channel width on the 5 GHz band**  \n> • **Up to 320 MHz channel width on the 6 GHz band**  \n> • **4096-QAM modulation**  \n> • **MLMR MLO (Multi-Link Multi-Radio)** capable of aggregating multiple Wi-Fi bands into one high-throughput pipeline  \n>  \n> While Apple meets the *minimum certification requirement* (MLSR MLO), it disables nearly all optional features that make Wi-Fi 7 truly high-performance. As a result, **iPhone 16 and 17 models perform at speeds comparable to Wi-Fi 6/6E**, while other flagship phones achieve **3–4× higher throughput** using the optional features Apple ignored for two generations.  \n>  \n> For context, Wi-Fi 6/6E tops out at **160 MHz-wide channels**, **1024-QAM modulation**, and only one Wi-Fi band at a time — yielding peak theoretical speeds around **2402 Mbps**.  \n>  \n> Wi-Fi 7, when fully implemented, doubles channel width to 320 MHz, quadruples QAM density to 4096, and enables **true multi-band operation via MLO**, dramatically increasing real-world throughput.  \n>  \n> Apple’s iPhones, however, still restrict channels to 160 MHz, leave QAM at 1024, and only use MLO as a basic failover mechanism — effectively **Wi-Fi 6/6E with rudimentary band steering**.  \n>  \n> Some argue that wider channels, higher QAM, or MLMR MLO would drain battery. While Apple may have designed these limits intentionally, other flagship phones fully enable these features **without widespread battery complaints**, showing it’s a feasible design choice.  \n>  \n> Others claim that 5 GHz doesn’t support 240 MHz channels — but in regions like the **United States**, access points can operate at 240 MHz on 5 GHz, and Apple’s iPhones simply don’t take advantage of it.  \n>  \n> Apple’s documentation confirms that the Broadcom chip in the iPhone 16 series and the N1 chip in the iPhone 17 series are **capped to a single 160 MHz band**. Meanwhile, users have observed the performance discrepancy across multiple forums and reviews:  \n>  \n> • [Jason Deegan review](https://jasondeegan.com/iphone-16-review-disappointment-with-wifi-7-performance/)  \n> • [Apple forum complaints](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255812908?sortBy=rank)  \n> • [MacRumors forum complaints](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-buy-wifi7-router.2438418/)  \n> • [Apple's official tech specs of 16 & 17 series](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/wi-fi-ethernet-specifications-apple-devices-dep268652e6c/web)  \n> • [TP-Link Community complaints](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/705570)  \n> • [YouTube comparison of the 16 series](https://youtu.be/07FRuS67iD8)  \n> • [YouTube comparison of the 17 series](https://youtu.be/VtimPHdiv7U)  \n> • [YouTube warning not to buy Wi-Fi 7 routers](https://youtube.com/shorts/Pc3dAEoPPFo)  \n> • [MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/apple-n1-chip-has-wi-fi-7-limitation/)  \n> • [5GStore analysis](https://5gstore.com/blog/2025/09/16/apple-n1-chip-wifi-7-iphone-17/#what-wccftech-found-apples-n-1-chip-its-limitation)  \n> • [PhoneArena article](https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-16-pro-models-prevented-from-reaching-full-wi-fi-7-potential_id163151)  \n> • [iThinkDiff article](https://www.ithinkdiff.com/apple-n1-chip-iphone-17-wifi-7-limit/)  \n> • [iPhoneWired article](https://iphonewired.com/news/857921/)  \n>  \n> In conclusion, many users invest in premium iPhones and Wi-Fi 7 equipment expecting the full benefits of the standard.

    "title": "The iPhone Upgrade Program is absolutely NOT compatible with AppleCare One",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR: DO NOT try and add your iPhone Upgrade Program iPhone to AppleCare One, unless you want significant problems down the road.**\n\nI added my 16 Pro to AppleCare One in July, a few days after the program started. The support specialist read me boilerplate along the lines of \"In order to remain enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program, you must immediately add your phone to AppleCare One to ensure no gap in coverage\". I did that, got a gift card back for \\~$120, and felt happy with myself.\n\nI successfully used the program to get a 17 Pro a few weeks ago, which I picked up in store. However, when I came to return the 16 Pro, the phone was marked as \"Enrolled in iPhone Upgrade Program\", but the option to close the loan was greyed out with \"loan details not found\". The store associates, up to and including supervisors were very confused by this and hadn't seen it before.\n\nAfter approximately **11 hours** on the phone with Citizens, and Apple Support, speaking with about 15 different people, all of whom were very friendly, but none of whom had any idea what had happened, and **3 visits** to the store, I was eventually advised to return the phone as a standalone trade-in, and receive a store gift card. I then had to call a special escalated support number and have them cancel the gift card and close the loan. (It still ended with a 4¢ balance, which I then had to pay Citizens by credit card 😅)\n\nI eventually had final confirmation from that escalated support line that, despite what AppleCare specialists tell you, and despite the boilerplate coverage language, cancelling the Theft and Loss protection to put your phone into AppleCare One **immediately** cancels the Upgrade Program eligibility. Obviously some systems are aware of this (allowing me to upgrade to 17 Pro), and some are not (preventing me from returning 16 Pro).\n\nI asked about the 17 Pro and confirmed that it too had been removed from the program. They advised me to do a Closed Box return in store and then immediately re-buy the same phone through the program to get it back into eligibility. I tried this, and while I passed the credit check and managed to keep my same phone, Verizon refused to activate the line (presumably because it was already connected - to me). As a result, I couldn't complete the transaction, and ended up having to re-buy my phone outright.\n\nTo Apple's credit, they recognized what a clusterfuck this was, and gave me a credit of $250, which I used for some AirPods Pro 3, and the guy in-store also gave me an Ultra Watch band for free. I also ended up with a negative loan balance of $260, which I got back as a check, and when you add back the $120 gift card back from July, I ended up doing ok. \n\nBut, it was an incredible time and energy suck and I did have to drop $1400 all in one go. I am lucky that I could just do that otherwise I would have left the store without my phone and then who knows what would have happened. I do not recommend this adventure to anyone. \n\nHopefully by the time the next phones are released there will be a proper integrated upgrade path, but for now, if you want to preserve your sanity, just stick with Theft and Loss coverage.\n\n ",

    "title": "Hazel is overkill for 90% of users. Mine works in 3 clicks.",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple! 👋\n\nI'm excited to share Neatify, a macOS productivity app I've been working on for automatic file organization.\n\n# \"Wait, isn't this just Hazel?\"\n\nFair question. I know Hazel exists, and it's an incredibly powerful tool. But here's the thing: Hazel is built for people who love to customize every detail. **Neatify is built for people who want their files organized instantly, without setup or scripting.**\n\n**I made Neatify for people who:**\n\n* Value automation that works right away\n* Want images in one folder, PDFs in another, done\n* Prefer project-based file routing without extra configuration\n* Want clarity instead of complexity\n\nThink of it this way: Hazel is a custom-built PC. Neatify is a MacBook that just works.\n\nBoth are powerful, but one lets you skip the setup and get things done faster.\n\nIf you enjoy building complex automation workflows, Hazel is fantastic. If you just want your files to go where they belong while you focus on your work, Neatify is built for you.\n\n# The Problem I'm Solving\n\nYou're working on multiple projects simultaneously. Literature essay, art history presentation, geopolitics research paper. Files are everywhere. Downloads folder is chaos. Every time you save or download something, you face decision fatigue: \"Where should this go?\"\n\nYou could use Hazel, but after 30 minutes of documentation and rule setup, you're more overwhelmed than when you started.\n\n# How Neatify Works\n\n**🎯 Project-Based Organization**\n\nCreate a project structure in 3 clicks:\n\n1. Name your project (e.g., \"Literature Essay\")\n2. Select file types to manage (Images, PDFs, Presentations)\n3. Choose location (Desktop, Documents, wherever)\n\nDone. Now every image you download automatically goes to Literature Essay/Images. Every PDF to Literature Essay/PDFs. No manual sorting.\n\n**⚡️ Smart File Sorting with Saved Rules**\n\nCreate reusable sorting configurations. One for work, one for personal files, one for creative projects. Switch between them from the menu bar in one click.\n\n**🔄 Quick Sorter**\n\nNeed to organize something right now? Quick Sorter lets you point at a folder, pick file types, and start sorting immediately. Perfect for one-off tasks.\n\n**🧹 Bulk File Organizer**\n\nGot a messy folder with 500 mixed files? Select it, and Neatify reorganizes everything into a clean structure (Visual/Images, Visual/Videos, Audio, Code/Frontend, Code/Backend, Documents, etc.) in seconds.\n\n**🚀 Set It and Forget It**\n\nEnable \"Launch at Login\" with a default project or rule. Neatify runs silently in your menu bar. Your files stay organized without you thinking about it.\n\n**📊 Menu Bar Control**\n\nClose the app, it lives in your menu bar. Switch sorting rules, pause/resume, or check status without opening the main window.\n\n# Why I Built This\n\nI was constantly switching between projects and drowning in file chaos. I tried Hazel, spent hours configuring it, felt more stressed, and thought: \"There has to be a simpler way.\"\n\nSo I built Neatify to do one thing really well: keep your files organized so you can focus on your work, not your folders.\n\nIt's 100% native macOS (Swift + SwiftUI), optimized for performance, and follows Apple's design language. No Electron bloat.\n\n# Try the Beta\n\nNeatify is currently in public beta on TestFlight. I'd genuinely love your feedback, especially from anyone who's tried Hazel and found it too heavy, or anyone juggling multiple projects who's tired of file chaos.\n\nBeta Access: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/Eyp3uwZS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Eyp3uwZS)  \nWebsite: [https://neatifyhq.com](https://neatifyhq.com)  \nDemo: [https://neatifyhq.com/#demo](https://neatifyhq.com/#demo)\n\nI'd Love Your Thoughts On\n\n* Does the \"simpler alternative to Hazel\" positioning make sense?\n* What file organization pain points do you face daily?\n* For Hazel users: what would make you consider a faster, easier tool?\n* Any concerns about automatic file management?\n\nI'll be here all day answering questions, discussing workflows, or debating the merits of different organization philosophies. Thanks for reading! 🙏",

The button press haptics are tuned to make it feel like a you are pressing a real button.\n\nThe features that make **Calki** stand out are the following:  \n\\- Add context to your calculation by labelling the calculation and sharing the labeled calculation.  \n\\- You can even label each number in a calculation for later reference and even share the calculation with the explanation.  \n\\- A favourite function which is the memory function of the standard calculator but more intuitive, this allows you to save number for later use, and you can name the numbers as well.  \n\\- There are themes for you to choose as well, the Retro theme is near completion and other themes are works in progress.\n\nI would like for you to try it out. It is available for free on Appstore at:  \n[https://apps.apple.com/in/app/calki/id6747059181](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/calki/id6747059181)\n\nIf you could please provide feedback and also what features you would like the app to have, it would be great.\n\nThank you",

Apple claims that this system is private and secure, but the code is proprietary, and such claims have to be taken on faith. It is well known that even with perfect cryptographic guarantees, logical flaws might creep into protocols, and allow undesirable attacks.\n\nThis paper presents a symbolic model of the Find My protocol, as well as a precise formal specification of desirable properties.",

The button press haptics are tuned to make it feel like a you are pressing a real button.\n\nThe features that make **Calki** stand out are the following:  \n\\- Add context to your calculation by labelling the calculation and sharing the labeled calculation.  \n\\- You can even label each number in a calculation for later reference and even share the calculation with the explanation.  \n\\- A favourite function which is the memory function of the standard calculator but more intuitive, this allows you to save number for later use, and you can name the numbers as well.  \n\\- There are themes for you to choose as well, the Retro theme is near completion and other themes are works in progress.\n\nI would like for you to try it out. It is available for free on Appstore at:  \n[https://apps.apple.com/in/app/calki/id6747059181](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/calki/id6747059181)\n\nIf you could please provide feedback and also what features you would like the app to have, it would be great.\n\nThank you",

Apple claims that this system is private and secure, but the code is proprietary, and such claims have to be taken on faith. It is well known that even with perfect cryptographic guarantees, logical flaws might creep into protocols, and allow undesirable attacks.\n\nThis paper presents a symbolic model of the Find My protocol, as well as a precise formal specification of desirable properties.",

    "selftext": "Changed to this 17 pro max recently and got the Belkin screen protector in the apple store. Few hours after leaving the store, this large air gap at the edge of the screen pops up. Unlike small bubbles in the middle of the screen, this kind of air gap does not disappear by applying pressure for a long time. \n\nI went to the apple store again the next day, and this employee kindly replaced mine. However, the problem continued to happen on that spot and he had to change it 4 times. Eventually, it is looking better than before but the air gap regularly returns on my screen where I need to press it hard to make it disappear for few hours.\n\nAm I the only one having this issue? Could this be manufacturing defects where the phone screen is bent? It is quite tiring to go back to that apple store again… I cannot even refund this phone since it is from the US and I live in europe…",

I am soft locked on it.\n\nMy phone number hasn’t changed and I know my password. I am also logged into gmail/youtube normally on my PC, but google doesn’t care as you HAVE TO verify it’s you via a smartphone. My old phone is wiped already and it’s literally impossible to log into my google account on my new phone, since it needs a phone (that is logged into the account) to verify \"it’s me“ who tries to log in. This is insane.\n\nThe most hilarious thing is, that it gives me the option to type in my phone number for verification (which again has not changed) and after doing so Google literally tells me they don’t have enough info to verify it’s me, don’t even send me an SMS code. Lmao.\n\nI have found older threads with the same issue but those solutions do not work anymore.\n\nI am about to lose my mind over this.",

About 2 weeks ago I upgraded again to 26.0.1…same issue. \n\nSo I open it to play today and guess what…it’s back to normal! Opening animation and gameplay are nice and smooth again. I’ve exited the game now several time and each time I’ve opened it back up it’s been fine. Needless to say I’m happy! I’m not sure what changed but I’m certainly glad it’s back to normal now.

    "selftext": "Recently my girlfriend gave me her old iPhone 4S. It's in excellent condition and I love the design and form factor.\n\nI decided to see if it's usable in 2025. Specifically I'm interested in installing 3 apps, Spotify, Messenger and Viber. I found some seemingly compatible .ipa files and installed them through Apptrans from my Mac. While it says the installation was successful, when I try to launch the apps I get a pop-up asking me to sign in the iTunes Store and after I enter my apple-id credentials the app just closes.\n\nAny ideas why this is happening and if it can be fixed? I should note that I live in Europe. Also  I don't have access to a newer iPhone model, so I can't use it to download the apps there and then use the purchase tab on the 4S to download an older version. ",

I promised it my mum when switching to 17 pro max. Got the 17 pro max which had a GH3 LG display which is the worst one. I noticed it had red tint on the right. Returned it.\nThen thought actually I want to try the air. Received it it’s been great such a nice e phone but then I noticed the speaker starting to rattle. Then noticed the display is warmer at the top. Checked the screen it was a G9P from Samsung which is 4th on the list. So I’m returning that now and as I promised my mother the 16 pro max off it goes. So until apple gets some stock I’m using her old 14 pro max. Noticed red tint in top right corner. Checked screen and again it’s a GH3 surprise surprise. Planning for a 17 pro now as I believe this is the phone most likely to get a g9n display or g9q display which is Samsungs best 2 panels. Has any one else had any issues with displays or just unhappy with the quality control lately? ",

    "title": "Weekly iOS Battery Support Megathread",
    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

Yet at the same time there’s something so familiar about both, that clean, minimalist Apple look.\n\nKinda wild to hold them side by side and realize how far tech has come while still feeling the familiar in some way.",

My last phone was an iPhone 16 pro max and i could fry an egg after a movie on the plane.\n\nThis phone dose not get hot for nothing, its crazy. I didn’t experiment where I had an NFL Redzone playing using Data for 7 hours straight and the phone was room temperature. I have no idea how they did this. That was my number one complaint since the first iphone. Anyways here i am writing this glaze. \n- a surprisingly happy user",

    "selftext": "Swapped a 14 Pro housing recently and wanted to share some quick notes and photos comparing a cheap aftermarket housing with the original Apple one.\n\nColor: The OEM housing (left on first picture, right on following) is more saturated and keeps its tone consistent under different lighting. The replacement tends to look darker or almost black in a lot of angles.\n\nTexture: The original has a slightly rougher matte feel (tried to capture that in picture two, right is original). You can also feel a small lip where the Apple logo is on the replacement, whereas it’s a smooth transition on the original.\n\nCamera bump: Most obvious difference. The replacement’s bump looks like two separate parts with a clear edge where the slope meets the back glass. The OEM one is a smooth, unibody transition.\n\nFrame: Shine and color are pretty close to the original (not comparable in the photos because the frame of the original used for comparison was tampered with), but tolerances are off. The SIM card slot and other cutouts don’t line up as cleanly (last picture)\n\nJust a few things to keep in mind if you’re buying used.",

I do not think it is something Apple cannot implement. It is more about the inconsistencies that would appear because of the wide variety of app icons.\n\nI am looking at this from Apple’s and the developers’ perspectives, not from a user’s point of view. I have not formally studied design, but I am deeply interested in it, and I can say that while the idea looks cool, it would appear inconsistent in practice.\n\nApp icons usually consist of around three to four layers of elements stacked on a background to create contrast. White elements, like in iOS 26, generally look good on most backgrounds except light ones such as yellow. But when you introduce elements in multiple color variations some icons will inevitably have stronger contrast than others, making the overall appearance feel messy and inconsistent. An example for you: The Settings app stands out less than the Maps app.\n\nI hope that makes sense. I am one hundred percent sure Apple’s design team has already considered OP’s idea and reached the same conclusion.\n\nIf you do not know what I am referring to, I would recommend checking out some of the Apple Developer Team’s videos about app icon design. They explain this topic in great detail.\n",

However, the problem continued to happen on that spot and he had to change it 4 times. Eventually, it is looking better than before but the air gap regularly returns on my screen where I need to press it hard to make it disappear for few hours.\n\nAm I the only one having this issue?

Yet at the same time there’s something so familiar about both, that clean, minimalist Apple look.\n\nKinda wild to hold them side by side and realize how far tech has come while still feeling the familiar in some way.",

When they set up & activated their iPhones, not only does it show that he indeed has AppleCare+ attached to the iPhone, but that the policy until 2034, nine years from now, which is insane as AppleCare+ is only for 2 years and then you can extend it afterwards up to a total of 5 years on a per month basis. We went back to the Genius Bar and had them check the serial number on Mobile Genius, and it is indeed genuine and an actual policy #. Totally covered.

The replacement tends to look darker or almost black in a lot of angles.\n\nTexture: The original has a slightly rougher matte feel (tried to capture that in picture two, right is original). You can also feel a small lip where the Apple logo is on the replacement, whereas it’s a smooth transition on the original.\n\nCamera bump: Most obvious difference. The replacement’s bump looks like two separate parts with a clear edge where the slope meets the back glass. The OEM one is a smooth, unibody transition.\n\nFrame: Shine and color are pretty close to the original (not comparable in the photos because the frame of the original used for comparison was tampered with), but tolerances are off. The SIM card slot and other cutouts don’t line up as cleanly (last picture)\n\nJust a few things to keep in mind if you’re buying used.",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

The phone suddenly stopped working overnight while charging normally.\n\nI sent it for repair through the official Google channel and received a diagnosis of “liquid damage”, with a repair quote of € 644.52 (out of warranty).\n\nHowever, the phone was never exposed to water. I asked Google Support for objective technical evidence (report, photos, LCI readings, methodology, technician ID, etc.), but they said they don’t have any documentation or photos, since the device was returned immediately after I declined the quote.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2019/771 (transposed in Portugal as Decree-Law 84/2021), sellers must provide technical proof when excluding warranty due to alleged misuse — otherwise, the fault is presumed to have existed at delivery.\n\nThe case was escalated to a “second-line” team three days ago, but I haven’t received any update.\n\nHas anyone in the EU experienced a similar situation with Google repairs? Were you able to get photos, a technical report, or have the decision overturned?\n\nI just want a transparent and evidence-based assessment — nothing more, nothing less.",

    "title": "[Dev] Introducing Media Bar - Control media playback from your status bar with swipe gestures!",
    "selftext": "Hi all! I've been working on something I think you'll find useful. **Media Bar** transforms your Android status bar into a functional media controller and progress indicator.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nInstead of pulling down notifications or switching apps to control your music/podcast/video, you can now:\n\n* **See media progress** as a thin colored bar along your status bar\n* **Swipe left/right** on the status bar to scrub through your media\n* **Tap, double-tap, or long-press** three invisible regions on the status bar for custom actions (play/pause, skip, jump forward/back, launch app, etc.)\n\n**How is this different from Android's Live Notifications or OneUI's Now Bar?**\n\nWhile Android's live notifications and Samsung's Now Bar are excellent features, Media Bar takes a different approach:\n\n* **Always visible, minimal footprint** \\- Just a thin line on your status bar (can be as small as 1 pixel), not a pill or expandable widget that takes screen real estate\n* **Blind muscle memory control** \\- Your entire status bar becomes an interactive surface. No need to look for or tap specific small buttons\n* **Works system-wide** \\- Doesn't matter which media app you're using or which Android skin you have\n* **Swipe to scrub** \\- Directly scrub through your media by swiping, rather than tapping skip buttons\n* **Deep customization** \\- Color coding for progress tracking, custom button zones, transparency options, etc.\n\nThink of it as complementary to those features - it's for when you want the most minimal, muscle-memory-based control possible.\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nI found myself constantly interrupting my workflow to control media playback - whether I was gaming, browsing, or working. I wanted something that was always visible and accessible without being intrusive.\n\n**The \"aha\" moment:**\n\nHere's the thing - **Media Bar might feel a bit unusual at first, but give it a day or two.** Once your muscle memory kicks in, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.\n\nImagine this: You're at the gym mid-rep and need to pause your music. Instead of fumbling to find the play button, your thumb just *knows* where to tap on the status bar. Or you're deep into a 3-hour podcast and want to skip ahead - a quick swipe does it without even looking.\n\n**That's the magic**: your fingers learn the zones, and suddenly media control becomes second nature. No more hunting for tiny buttons or pulling focus from what you're doing. It just... flows. I'm confident that once it becomes part of your routine, it'll feel indispensable.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n**Color coding options** \\- Solid colors, dynamic (based on album art/app), segments (changes color at different progress points), or gradients\n\n**Highly customizable** \\- Adjust the bar's thickness (down to 1 pixel!), position (top/bottom), transparency, button regions, and more\n\n**Smart behavior** \\- Auto-hides in fullscreen apps, works with any media player\n\nIf you want to give it a shot, [get it from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.mediabar)! I would love to hear what you guys think about it and happy to answer any questions you may have! I would specifically like to hear if you build a muscle memory for it! :)",

The issue got escalated to an incident this morning.\n\nWell, I just got news that Google thinks the Pixel hanging/crashing apps bug is now fixed. I've asked for clarification on whether the fix is server-side or requires a Play Services update. https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1977868145840050230\n\n**Update**: Alright, got confirmation that the Pixel crashing/hanging apps fix is server-side. There will be a post-mortem within Google, but I'm not sure if it will be made public. Incidents like this one cannot happen again.

    "title": "I Switched from iPhone to Android: My Story of Losses and Gains",
    "selftext": "# Hey Reddit! I want to share my story of switching from iPhone to Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It wasn't just choosing a new phone; it was a real journey full of expectations, doubts, and unexpected discoveries.\n\n# Introduction: Seeking a New Experience\n\nI used an iPhone 13 Pro and it was almost perfect. Even when the Pixel 10 came out, I had no desire to watch the presentation. But over time, I started to feel a \"technological itch.\" I was tired of Apple's predictability and the lack of true innovation. When the 17th iPhone came out again without significant AI improvements, it was the final disappointment. On the horizon appeared the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra — a symbol of freedom, customization, and powerful AI. This wasn't just a phone choice; it was a choice of a new philosophy. I dreamed of a world where I control my device, not the other way around.\n\n# Part I: Pros and Cons from My Experience\n\niPhone (iOS): The World I Left Behind\n\n•Pros (What I Miss):\n\n•\"Ecosystem magic\" is not a myth, but a reality. It's not just a set of features, but an invisible fabric that connects the family. I acutely felt this when I realized I could no longer see my wife's phone battery charge (a symbol of care) and disappeared from our shared fitness competition (a symbol of play and unity).\n\n•Flawless simplicity (\"It just works\"). AirPods connecting with animation, passwords autofilling without glitches, stable battery performance after updates. This reliability is not \"boring,\" but reassuring. It brings peace of mind, freeing my brain from having to \"fix\" basic things.\n\n•Predictability as an advantage. I always know what to expect. No unpleasant surprises, like a sudden battery drain or strange sleep metrics on the watch after an update. It's a world without rollercoasters.\n\n•Camera philosophy. The iPhone camera strives for a \"cinematic\" reality. It creates volumetric, pleasing-to-the-eye photos immediately, without the need to \"tinker\" with settings.\n\n•Well-designed password system. Passwords seemed like a simple app. But it's so well-designed that you don't need to remember many passwords; importantly, it generates passwords itself and works across other devices.\n\n•Integrated calls and messages. The ability to call other messengers from the built-in call app and a convenient built-in messaging app.\n\n•Health and fitness synchronization. Easy synchronization of a fitness tracker and app with the built-in health app.\n\n•Battery life. I'm impressed that such a small battery lasts an active day. No need to turn off Bluetooth and WiFi to save power.\n\n•User care. Features related to health, diary, and headphone usage monitoring.\n\n•Sound quality. Good sound from the speakers and the phone itself.\n\n•Size and dimensions. Exactly what I was looking for.\n\n•Face ID. A very convenient feature, especially at work where fingerprint unlock might be inconvenient.\n\n•Seamless Bluetooth connection. No problems connecting to Bluetooth devices.\n\n•Reminders. The \"Reminders\" app is very helpful for organizing thoughts and tasks.\n\n•Cons (Why I Left):\n\n•\"Golden cage.\" The feeling of being locked in. Dependence on AirDrop, iMessage, lack of flexibility. The desire to break free and try something new was incredibly strong.\n\n•Illusion of innovation. Annual updates brought minimal changes but cost maximum money. It felt like a waste.\n\n•Lack of control. I can't customize the system to my liking. I'm forced to live by Apple's rules. This is annoying when I know there could be something better and more convenient for me.\n\n•Notification limitations. Inability to change notification sounds in Instagram and Viber.\n\n•Browser limitations. On iPhone, you can't choose which browser to open news from the Google News app, which leads to a lot of ads.\n\nSamsung (Android/One UI): The World I Chose\n\n•Pros (What I'm Fighting For):\n\n•True freedom and customization. The ability to customize everything — from the desktop to system functions via Good Lock. It's the feeling that you are the master of your device. It's my own home where I choose the wall color.\n\n•Powerful, ahead-of-its-time innovations. Galaxy AI, enhanced camera capabilities (after configuration), DeX. I feel like I'm using the technologies of the future today.\n\n•Sense of uniqueness. I'm not \"one of the crowd.\" My choice is conscious and differs from the mainstream. This brings a certain intellectual satisfaction.\n\n•Small things that make life easier. A more convenient messenger, a better keyboard, no \"crutches\" for basic things (like listening to music from the browser).\n\n•System openness. The ability to install modded YouTube and YouTube Music apps, which works great.\n\n•Circle to Search. The on-screen search function works great.\n\n•Watch integration. Notifications from my device work on my watch, which was an important factor.\n\n•Step transfer. Steps from the phone are transferred to the watch, allowing me to see full activity statistics.\n\n•Browser control. The ability to uncheck \"open in built-in browser\" for news, which helps avoid ads.\n\n•Cons (The Harsh Truth):\n\n•Freedom requires work. Customization is not only joy but also a necessity. Sometimes this necessity turns into \"repair.\" When I have to fix basic functions (battery, sleep tracking) after an update, it's no longer \"customization\" but fixing manufacturer errors.\n\n•Fragility of innovations. The latest features can be \"raw\" and break. This undermines trust. I expect stability from a flagship but get beta testing for my own money.\n\n•Emotional isolation. The most significant drawback. I fall out of familiar family \"digital rituals.\" This creates a feeling of loneliness and makes me wonder if technological freedom is worth this emotional price.\n\n•Camera quality. Photos come out \"flat,\" without the depth or volume that iPhone has. Videos are also not top-notch. I want the phone to do this for me, not force me to \"play with photos.\" iPhone handles this, even the 13 Pro.\n\n•UI appearance. The iPhone's lock screen looks better.\n\n•Reminders and calendar. Reminder events don't appear in the calendar by default, and while there are workarounds, it feels like a \"crutch.\"\n\n•Weather app. The iPhone's weather app is more detailed; Samsung just redirects to a web page.\n\n•Passwords. The built-in password app doesn't always work on time or connect to save new passwords. I had to install Bitwarden.\n\n•Watch. Although notifications work, auto-tracking for cycling didn't start, and heart rate shows incorrectly during elliptical workouts.\n\n# Part II: The Main Conclusion I Reached\n\nI realized that my choice wasn't between two phones. It was a choice between two life priorities: personal technological freedom and seamless family integration.\n\nI left iPhone because I valued the first. I started to miss it because I underestimated the importance of the second.\n\nThe problem isn't that Samsung is bad and iPhone is good. The problem is that an ideal world where there is both absolute freedom and absolute integration with family on another platform does not exist. And each of us is forced to choose which of these two values is more important to us at a given moment in life.\n\nMy struggle is not an attempt to prove that Samsung is better. It's an attempt to find a way to \"build bridges\" between my new free world and the cozy \"digital home\" where my family remained. And I don't know yet if I will succeed.\n\nMy choice of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was wise, economically justified, and aligns with my desire for innovation and freedom. The only thing I need to do is give myself permission to fully transition to Samsung. Stop comparing and start enjoying my new device. True perfectionism is not demanding an ideal, but achieving maximum comfort with minimal expenditure of resources (time, money, nerves). That's exactly what I did.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI’ve been using an iPhone 17 Pro Max for a few weeks, mainly for content creation (Reels, short cinematic clips, fitness/gym stuff, and occasional fire performances) — and while the camera quality is amazing, the file transfer and workflow side is driving me insane.\n\nI edit both on my phone (CapCut) and PC (Windows). iCloud + iTunes + “Save to Photos” steps feel like a nightmare compared to simple drag-and-drop or Google Drive sync on Android. It honestly kills the efficiency of my whole process.\n\nSo now I’m looking to switch back to Android and want your advice on what’s currently the best phone for video creators in 2025.\nI care most about:\n\t•\t🎥 Video quality (1×/2×) and realistic color for quick IG posts\n\t•\t⚙️ Simple file transfer to PC (no cloud hoops)\n\t•\t📱 Stable performance for 4K clips and CapCut/LumaFusion editing\n\t•\t🔋 Battery / heat management for 10–20 min recordings\n\t•\t⚡ Optional: good telephoto for stage/fire show shots\n\nFrom what I’ve seen:\n\t•\tPixel 10 Pro looks closest to iPhone-style auto color/WB but maybe underpowered?\n\t•\tS25 Ultra seems unbeatable for tele and versatility.\n\t•\tXiaomi 15 Ultra has crazy creative potential, but I’m not sure about reliability or color accuracy straight out of camera.\n\nSo, if you’ve tested these (or any others) for content creation, what’s your pick?\nWhat are you using for video workflow → edit → upload right now?\nAny tips for making Android as “ready-to-post” as iPhone would be super appreciated 🙏",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed.

    "selftext": "Compared to traditional Linux distros, Android is very restricted, the newer versions even more so, it is very hard to root too. So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

    "title": "Google denied Pixel 8 warranty repair claiming “liquid damage” — but refused to provide any proof. Anyone else?",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have a Google Pixel 8, still under the EU 3-year legal warranty. The phone suddenly stopped working overnight while charging normally.\n\nI sent it for repair through the official Google channel and received a diagnosis of “liquid damage”, with a repair quote of € 644.52 (out of warranty).\n\nHowever, the phone was never exposed to water. I asked Google Support for objective technical evidence (report, photos, LCI readings, methodology, technician ID, etc.), but they said they don’t have any documentation or photos, since the device was returned immediately after I declined the quote.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2019/771 (transposed in Portugal as Decree-Law 84/2021), sellers must provide technical proof when excluding warranty due to alleged misuse — otherwise, the fault is presumed to have existed at delivery.\n\nThe case was escalated to a “second-line” team three days ago, but I haven’t received any update.\n\nHas anyone in the EU experienced a similar situation with Google repairs? Were you able to get photos, a technical report, or have the decision overturned?\n\nI just want a transparent and evidence-based assessment — nothing more, nothing less.",

Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Recently, I was searching for flip phone reviews and saw an article on the Vertu website. The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "selftext": "Purchased a Pixel 9 about a month ago while on vacation in another country because my previous phone gave out. I noticed that there is a noticeable gap between the screen and the frame (enough to slot a piece of paper in), mostly uniform but slightly more pronounced at the bottom. The screen is also ever so slightly raised up from frame level.\n\nI didn't request for the device to be replaced because I was due to leave for the country I live in in just a few days, also because there was conflicting information online on whether this was normal or not.\n\nI also recently noticed that sometimes there's this faint cluster of pixels flashing green just under the selfie camera cutout (happens only on lower brightness settings), although I'm not sure if it's a hardware issue because I haven't seen it before, and I would definitely have noticed it before if it happened. I don't think it's dead/stuck pixels either because I don't see this happening when I view solid colours on the screen. Also since this phone has a Samsung display and not a BOE one, so the chances are lower. It's usually intermittent but it has stopped happening for now.\n\nI also understand that the gap probably won't void the water resistance because it's not the size of the gap that protects the device, rather the glue under the screen that attaches the display to the frame.\n\nAnyway, I contacted Google support today, and the support agent was more than willing to start an RMA when I asked for it, and said they'd send a brand new replacement. They also said they'd reject the RMA if they found physical damage on my current device.\n\nNow I'm just confused if it's worth attempting an RMA because the phone seems to be working fine and the gap probably doesn't affect water resistance. Besides, there's a couple hairline scratches on the screen, hard to find, but they're there. \n\nI'm afraid the RMA might get rejected because of this and apparently the whole process may take 5-10 business days.

Or do you need to swap logic boards for that? ",

    "selftext": "It's been 3 weeks since my Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold started having multiple problems. It's been 3 weeks since I've been going back an forth with Google over this phone. I bought the phone brand new about 3 months ago and it has been great until these last 3 weeks. These are my problems. \n\n1.      The SIM reader stopped reading my SIM suddenly\n\n2.      The Front screen started glitching and sometimes won’t come on\n\n3.      The phone overheats every time I use it\n\n4.      The phone doesn’t receive charge when unfolded\n\n5.      The camera app causes the phone to hang/crash\n\n6.      If restarted, the phone may not come one until after 12 hours of repeated attempts at turning it on\n\n7.      The phone just goes off on its own.\n\nAt first, Google had me send my phone to a google affiliated repair center who stated that the only problem with the phone was a small scratch and so the warranty had been removed. To fix the phone, I was given a quote for EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!!   \nI requested to have my phone returned and reached out to Google support again. This time, I was asked to take pictures of the phone and send it to the Google support again. The agent looked at the phone and stated that there were scratches to the phone's body, camera and inner screen. What he saw were left over stickies from the phone living in a Spigen body armor. \n\nI spoke to another agent who just cut the phone on me and did not call back. After speaking to 5 different Google support agents, one agent finally agreed to have me send the phone to Google's very own technicians in Warsaw Poland. Within a day, I received a report that there was a dent on the inner screen and that the warranty had been removed and to fix it, I HAD TO PAY A THIRD OF WHAT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!! No report was given with regards the 7 problems the phone had. \n\nIt's been 3 weeks since this problem started, 3 weeks without a phone, 3 weeks of putting my sim in my wife's phone just to check my notifications. 3 weeks of going around in circles with Google support. \n\nStill I haven't gotten any report about the 7 problems with the phone. Before this phone, I've been with Samsung for the past 17 years and I had no problems with their service whatsoever. Honestly I'm starting to regret leaving Samsung. \n\nAt the moment, I still do not have a phone, I'm still going back and forth with Google agents and so far, only one agent has brought up the option of a replacement and for that to occur, they have to check the warranty. \n\nPlease if you have experienced this problem or anything similar, what happens next? Will Google replace the phone? And if the answer is Yes (I hope), how long will it take. \n\nMy productivity has received a massive dent as a result of all this. I have had countless sleepless nights because of this. \n\nGoogle, please, this is not how to treat humans. This is totally unfair. ",

    "selftext": "Title says it all. My iPhone 13 mini does a solid job for a daily user. Since the iOS 26 update, it heats up like crazy, and is still very fidgety. I like my 13 Mini. It has gotten the job done since 2021. I am not a gamer, not a hardcore photographer, but do use it for audio, YouTube, and the basics. Most, if not all my apps are Google Apps, so I think the transition will be easier, but you never know. I decided to switch because of the following:\n\n* My life does not revolve around the Apple ecosystem (even though I have a Mac)\n* I use Google Apps DAILY\n* Don't give a shit about iMessage or Facetime. I actually HATE any video calls lol.\n* My 13 mini is getting old in technology and super laggy.\n* I was able to get the Pixel 10PRO 256gb for only $2 more a month, AND keep my mini. My new bill is only $64 and I could not pass this deal.\n* If I don't like the Pixel, I can return it, get my money back, and switch back to my mini.\n\nI have a feeling I am going to love the Pixel 10PRO. I am NOT anti iPhone. I am NOT anti Android. I just wanted to try Android again after 13 years. The Pixel 10 Pro fit the bill for what I was looking for. With that being said, the phone arrived today. I will setup later today and report back in a couple weeks. If anyone has some tips, tricks, or suggestions on setting up, please let me know. I have read other threads as well with PRO/ANTI iPhone/Androind content. I thought to myself, guys, it's just a phone... Thank you!",

    "title": "What To Do When Your Pixel Phone is Stuck in Fastboot Mode [Guide]",
    "selftext": "My Pixel phone got accidentally stuck in fastboot mode, and it was one of the most annoying situations one could get into, where I was stuck with a single message on screen and nothing was working. Even the Google support team was of no great help, and all my data was certain to be lost. Somehow, after a lot of sweat and tears, I was able to crack the problem by collecting little tips from various parts of the internet. As there isn't much helpful advice available, I decided to write a guide post for anyone in the future who gets stuck in a similar situation as mine.\n\n**Note - Skip to the TLDR at the end of the post if you want a simple, direct instruction on how to follow up.**\n\n# Context:\n\nMy Pixel 6a was having issues with the **Volume Down(-)** button, which either seemed to never work or work on its own all of a sudden. Initially, I didn't consider it a big issue until today, when my phone's battery died, and after rebooting, it suddenly entered the infamous Fastboot Mode (I suspect it was because the Volume Down button started acting on its own while simultaneously being pressed with the Power button).\n\nAt first, this didn't seem like a big problem until I realised what the actual mess I was in. My phone didn't seem to do anything, and I was stuck with a single message on screen like[ (this)](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-forums-api/attachment/thread-282377112-7952556128442379489.jpg). With notable information being:\n\n\\- Start message next to the power button\n\n\\- Device status: locked\n\n\\- Enter reason: vol down pressed\n\nNow there was another message next to the volume buttons, which said 'Press the volume keys to select a different menu,' but my device would literally do nothing. It wouldn't change the options when I press the volume keys. Holding the power button would do nothing. The screen would only show this single thing, and nothing would work. It won't even turn on and off. My whole phone was frozen and felt useless. I even let the battery die in the hope that when I would boot it again, everything would go back to normal, but nope, it was still the same screen.\n\n# Google's response:\n\nEventually, I called into Google's helpline to ask for assistance. The Google agent assigned to me was nice but didn't prove to be very helpful as he told me that my phone's software had crashed, from what he could understand on the call, and that I would need to get it repaired from Google's official service centre. Now the problem was that I was in my hometown on vacation, and it would take me another week to go back to the city where their centre is located. That being said, time was still not the major issue because the agent said that there was a 90% chance that all my data would get erased, and that was the dealbreaker for me, cause I didn't want to lose any of the data and memories I had saved in my phone.\n\n# What Worked For Me:\n\nI was really hopeless. But like a drowning man clutching at straws, I was ready to try any advice that might work. On the internet, there was little to no helpful advice available, until I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/s/jijM57t5Af) lifesaver of a Reddit post by u/albogaster, and while I suggest reading the full post, I found these two videos ([ Vid 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTT0_mfCgDc) &[ Vid 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqhlzvzznXM)) by the YT channel **WorldOfTech** to be the most helpful.\n\nThe two videos basically explain to you:\n\n1.[ How to Boot into Android Recovery Menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTT0_mfCgDc)\n\n2.[ How to Exit 'Waiting on Rescue Command'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqhlzvzznXM)\n\nYou can check out both of these videos for your knowledge, but I will be including the tips gathered from these videos in the **'Step-by-Step Tutorial'** section of my **TLDR.**\n\nThere's another important video mentioned in the post ([Vid 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMaoXQkKy_w)) by YT channel **HardReset(dot)Info,** which explains to you how to enter[ Recovery Mode from Fastboot Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMaoXQkKy_w) that you should check out.\n\nNow, I knew what needed to be done, but still, my problem was that **my phone was literally frozen with no buttons working,** unlike the tutorials I had seen, where they at least had the option to navigate through volume buttons. That was until I came across[ this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/11e2jho/comment/ktc4tpt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) comment by u/Forsaken\\_Youth\\_924,1, which said:\n\n\\> hold power and volume up till it vibrates and resets, then hold volume down and power while it's off and click vol up once to get to that weird core command menu and use volume to go up or down, power to select\n\nSo that's what I did, I held the Power button with the Volume Up button for a good amount of 20 seconds, and **it turned off!**\n\nYay!! At least it did something! At least it did something other than being stuck on a single screen!\n\nNow that was progress.\n\nBut it was not long until I was disappointed again, because the next step wouldn't work. Nope. Nothing. It will come back to the same screen again. Tried pressing the Power button + Vol Down button for a good amount of time while it was still off. Didn't work. Tried pressing the Power button alone. Didn't work.\n\nI suspected that it must be because my Vol Down button is not working. But what do I do now? Do I get it repaired first? Is this gonna work at all?\n\nBut then I came across[ this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/11e2jho/comment/ksm7nlj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) other comment under the same thread, which advised to hit the volume down key as hard as you can, **and... it worked!** What in the world?! I didn't even expect the solution to my problem would be this simple. Just banged the Vol Down key across the table as hard as I could, then pressed the Power + Vol Down key while the screen was still off and voila, I was able to navigate the menu using the volume buttons.\n\nNow with that working, I selected the **Recovery Mode** option which bought me to a screen that said **'No Command'** and then using the information from the above videos, I went into the Recovery Mode Menu and selected the **Reboot System option** and finally there I reclaimed my phone from the devil's claw without losing any of my data and without paying the repairing charges.\n\nThanks to both u/albogaster and u/Forsaken\\_Youth\\_9241 without whom this wouldn't have been possible.\n\nFor those who want a step-by-step tutorial, please read the TLDR next.\n\n# TLDR\n\nGot locked into Fastboot mode and here's what helped me:\n\n**The Issue:**\n\n\\- Stuck in Fastboot mode\n\n\\- Not able to navigate in Fastboot mode\n\n\\- Volume Down Key not working\n\n\\- Device state: Locked\n\n\\- Enter reason: Vol down pressed\n\n**Step-by-Step Tutorial:**\n\n**- Step 1:** **Fix the Volume Down Button (if not working):** You gotta get it repaired, or maybe try banging it across the edge of a table really hard (worked for me). I know this sounds silly but it works and it's crucial for our process.\n\n**- Step 2: Reset the Fastboot Navigation setting** **(if not working):** Press and hold the **Power Button** and **Volume Up** button simultaneously for a long time (maybe 20 seconds or more). This will turn off the screen. Now press and hold the **Power button** and **Volume Down button** together. This will **reset** the Fastboot page, and you will now be able to navigate through the volume buttons.\n\n**- Step 3: Exit Fastboot Navigation:** With the volume buttons now working, press **Volume Down** button and navigate towards the **Recovery Mode** (not rescue mode) and press **Power Button** once. A Google logo will pop up, and you'll come across a screen that says **'No Command'**. Now, hold the **Power button** and while you're holding it press the **Volume Up botton 'once’,** and you will see a **menu** pop up.\n\n**- Step 4: Reboot System:** In the menu, navigate to the **'Reboot System Now'** option using the volume keys, and while it's selected, press the **Power button** ‘**once’,** and now it'll boot your screen normally. That's it!\n\nI know this was long, but I hope it was helpful.\n\nThanks.",

    "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI have a second hand Pixel 8 Pro that I bought a month ago and it was working great until I two days ago when I installed an urgent update by Pixel (I believe it was Android 16 (Build Number: BP3A.251005.004.B1). After a day and a half I woke to find my screen flickering and twitching and randomly turning off when I check certain colours or images (I suspect dark mode or anything remotely using dark colours)\n\nHere is a video of the issue: [Screen Flickering - Pixel Pro 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFg0WO_FcLI?si=bFy31aqzQIRG29NI)\n\nI googled the issue as it didn't make sense to me that a hardware issue would cause that in such a context, I suspect it is a software issue. Here is what I tried to no avail:\n\n-Rebooting the phone, even in Safe Mode\n-Taking off the screen protector\n-Disabling \"Smooth Display\" (120hz mode) and lowering the resolution to \"high resolution\"\n-Disabling \"Adaptive Brightness\" and keeping it at 30-40%\n-Accessing the developper options and disabling \"HW Overlays\"\n\nSo as you can see, I virtually tried everything except factory reset which I don't want to do for the time being. I opt-in in the Android Beta Program to see if a Beta OTA Update would help, still waiting for one at the moment.\n\nAt this point I'm worried it is hardware issue and since I live in Morocco I can't send it to Google nor benefit from an extended replacement program that Google provides in supported countries. In worst case scenario I can order a screen replacement from iFixit and see if I can find a repairman here in the local market to install it but before resorting to such a costly course of action, I'd like to see if someone managed to fix this issue before\n\nThank you in advance",

But the amount of issues I've had with the 9 fold is ridiculous.\n\nHere's a list in order that mine has:\n\n1. Volume down button stopped working - can't turn down the volume using this button, can't screenshot\n\n2. Quick tap has stopped working - started to get less reactive, at first if I turned it off and on, it would work for a bit then would stop. Now it doesn't react at all. Randomly it would take screenshots on its own. I just turned it off completely.\n\n3. Camera has gotten worst at detecting and adjusting for light - under certain lighting conditions, it doesn't auto adjust accurately and there will be things that look like slightly off colored stripes going horizontally.\n\n4. Phone charges only when it is closed - If I open it, plugged in or not, the battery icon turns into a grayed out empty symbol with a question mark. It doesn't charge and battery health drops from 97% to 25%, only when it's open.\n\n5. Related to 4 possibly - it's become laggy and charges slowly over the course of one day after #4 started.\n\nLuckily, Google support has put in a ticket for me to take it to a repair center and get it repaired or replaced under warranty. The issue is that I am stationed overseas so have to send it to my parent in the US to take it to the repair center (there's none authorized near me) and then send it back to me.  Looking at about 2 months without the phone. Parent isn't technically savvy so low chance they'll be able to test it out prior to sending back to me.\n\nFortunately I have my old pixel 6 in a drawer that I can use.\n\nYour turn, what problems have y'all experienced?",

When I would force restart it via bootloader, it would work fine for a short amount of time before locking up again. \n\nContacted support, they recommended factory reset. Since then, the screen is no longer breaking, but instead it won't allow me to create any password locks, can't connect/see any Bluetooth or WiFi networks, and most apps will force close after it gets stuck opening for a few minutes. \n\nSupport now says to take it to uBreakiFix, but it's unclear what they can do other than investigate more. Am I cooked? Should I be looking at an upgrade? Any suggestions or ideas would be appreciated! ",

Has anyone had a similar problem before and do you think there’s *any realistic chance* to recover my data?\n\n**The problem:**  \nMy Pixel 8 Pro suddenly became unusable about two days ago.  \nIt boots up normally to the PIN entry screen. Once I enter the PIN, it works for about 10 seconds, then freezes, goes black, shows the Google logo, briefly says “shutting down,” and reboots.\n\nAfter a few reboot loops, I end up in the following screen:\n\n    Android Recovery\n    google/husky/husky\n    16/BP3A.251005.004.B1/1402072\n    Use volume up/down and power.\n    Android system can’t be loaded. Your data may be corrupted. \n    If you continue to get this message, you may need to perform a factory reset and erase all user data.\n    [Try again]\n    [Factory data reset]\n    \n\n**Why this is especially painful:**  \nThe phone contains irreplaceable photos of my newborn son (yeah, I know — no backup, no sympathy...). There’s no cloud backup unfortunately.\n\n**Things I’ve already tried:**\n\n* Removed SIM card (to avoid the SIM PIN screen).\n* Booted into Safe Mode → no change.\n* OTA sideload:\n   * Reinstalled the current September OTA.\n   * Tried older OTAs, but downgrade isn’t possible (rollback protection?).\n   * Installed the latest official OTA (`husky-ota-bp3a.251005.004.b1-edb8ab36`) via sideload — update succeeded, but issue persists.\n\n**Current situation:**  \nI can reach the lockscreen, but the device crashes right after entering the PIN. So I can’t back up anything via USB or change settings.\n\n**My question:**  \nIs there *any* way a repair center or advanced tool could access `/data` without triggering a full wipe (factory reset or bootloader unlock)?  \nPIN and Google account credentials are of course available — I just desperately want to preserve the photos if possible.\n\nIf anyone has experience with Pixel 8/8 Pro data recovery, Rescue/Repair mode, or similar boot loop issues, I’d be extremely grateful for any guidance.\n\nThanks a lot in advance for any help or insights!",

Da ich im Ausland war und nicht unbegrenzt Datenvolumen hatte, musste schnell eine Lösung für mein Problem gefunden werden.\n\nAuf Reddit gab es einen Beitrag. Tatsächlich soll das ein Pixel 8 Pro-spezifisches Problem sein. Ich habe dann alles probiert: Netzwerkeinstellungen resetet, Handy mehrmals neu gestartet etc. Mein letzter Ausweg war dann, das Handy komplett zu reseten. Dadurch war das Problem für exakt zwei Tage weg. Ich hatte wieder wlan und war glücklich wie ein kleiner Junge! Naja, wie gesagt, es ging dann wieder nicht.\n\nZuhause angekommen und weiter recherchiert. Anscheinend kann es am nicht installierten Google Play Update liegen. Also das probiert. Jedes Mal, wenn das Update fertig installiert war, hat mein Handy sich einfach neu gestartet und auf einmal stand wieder: \"Letztes Update Juni - neues Update verfügbar\".\n\nDas war mir dann auch zu viel. Da ich noch Gewährleistung hatte, habe ich das Handy an Google mit dem Problem \"Softwarefehler - Netzwerkfehler\" zugeschickt (heile! Da ich mein Handy samt Hülle und Luftkissen zu ihnen geschickt habe, ging ich auch davon aus, dass mein Handy das überlebt).\n\nDiesen Montag kam die Nachricht: \"Ihr Handy ist da und wurde überprüft. Softwarefehler gibt es keine, aber Ihr Display ist zerbrochen und kann für $170\\\\text{ €}$ ausgetauscht werden.\" Ich habe den Reparaturauftrag abgebrochen und mein Handy bis jetzt nicht erhalten, obwohl es eigentlich spätestens gestern da sein soll...\n\nMuss sagen: Erstes und letztes Pixel für mich gewesen.

No confirmation, no tracking, and now, no return label & packing slip.\n\nIf I do not return the faulty device I will be charged for it so I'm becoming very concerned that's its not been provided. I can see on the details of the RMA there is a tracking number for the return so it should have been automatically sent out. I don't know if there was a bug when I ordered the replacement, or if I could've mistyped my email somewhere? \n\nOn the 15th I chatted to a rep to get it resolved asap, they said they'd get back to me within 24 hours. It's now been over 48 hours. I've called to speak to a rep on the 16th, who told me the same, that was over 24 hours ago. I'm hoping someone here may have some experience on the matter? I get quite bad anxiety about this sort of thing, the phone was a treat for myself and I can't afford to be out another £1000\n\nTIA",

    "selftext": "Just upgraded from my old iphone 11 and man this thing is crazy good. I've never had an android before. battery life is actually insane, i can use it all day and still got decent battery  left. Not only a year after changing the battery on iPhone 11 especially on the newer IOS versions I'd be charging 3 times a day. I paid £400 brand new and retail was £700 (not dollars, UK currency) \n\nthe screen tho… 120hz is so smooth i cant even go back now lol. colours look way better too and the blacks actually look black not that washed out grey iphone screen had. One of the biggest upgrades coming from a very old LCD panel.\n\neveryone always says pixels got bad chips but idk I am not gonna play games on my phone that's what PlayStation is for. It's very optimized and stock android so there are zero performance issues. Phone hasn't stuttered once. Not sure what they’re talking about cuz this thing actually flies. super snappy even with a bunch of apps open. charging is fast too, using an anker 30w cable and its topped up really quickly.\n\nI find myself using Gemini all the time, it's actually really useful, the other ai features are really cool too like the magic eraser and all the other photo and video enhancements.\n\ncamera’s just ridiculous. ultra wide is my fav, barely loses any detail and the pics just look much cleaner and more detailed compared to my old phone.\n\nhonestly didn’t expect it to be this good. coming from an older iphone this feels super refreshing. might actually stick with pixel for a long while. Using android is also very refreshing after looking at basically the same phones and OS for 13 years and it also seems to be much more user friendly in certain aspects, but I do miss some things from iOS but overall it's a great phone. Using the same IOS for years gave me \"apple fatigue\" so this will do for now. \n\n",

    "selftext": "It's been 3 weeks since my Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold started having multiple problems. It's been 3 weeks since I've been going back an forth with Google over this phone. I bought the phone brand new about 3 months ago and it has been great until these last 3 weeks. These are my problems. \n\n1.      The SIM reader stopped reading my SIM suddenly\n\n2.      The Front screen started glitching and sometimes won’t come on\n\n3.      The phone overheats every time I use it\n\n4.      The phone doesn’t receive charge when unfolded\n\n5.      The camera app causes the phone to hang/crash\n\n6.      If restarted, the phone may not come one until after 12 hours of repeated attempts at turning it on\n\n7.      The phone just goes off on its own.\n\nAt first, Google had me send my phone to a google affiliated repair center who stated that the only problem with the phone was a small scratch and so the warranty had been removed. To fix the phone, I was given a quote for EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!!   \nI requested to have my phone returned and reached out to Google support again. This time, I was asked to take pictures of the phone and send it to the Google support again. The agent looked at the phone and stated that there were scratches to the phone's body, camera and inner screen. What he saw were left over stickies from the phone living in a Spigen body armor. \n\nI spoke to another agent who just cut the phone on me and did not call back. After speaking to 5 different Google support agents, one agent finally agreed to have me send the phone to Google's very own technicians in Warsaw Poland. Within a day, I received a report that there was a dent on the inner screen and that the warranty had been removed and to fix it, I HAD TO PAY A THIRD OF WHAT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!! No report was given with regards the 7 problems the phone had. \n\nIt's been 3 weeks since this problem started, 3 weeks without a phone, 3 weeks of putting my sim in my wife's phone just to check my notifications. 3 weeks of going around in circles with Google support. \n\nStill I haven't gotten any report about the 7 problems with the phone. Before this phone, I've been with Samsung for the past 17 years and I had no problems with their service whatsoever. Honestly I'm starting to regret leaving Samsung. \n\nAt the moment, I still do not have a phone, I'm still going back and forth with Google agents and so far, only one agent has brought up the option of a replacement and for that to occur, they have to check the warranty. \n\nPlease if you have experienced this problem or anything similar, what happens next? Will Google replace the phone? And if the answer is Yes (I hope), how long will it take. \n\nMy productivity has received a massive dent as a result of all this. I have had countless sleepless nights because of this. \n\nGoogle, please, this is not how to treat humans. This is totally unfair. ",

    "selftext": "Title says it all. My iPhone 13 mini does a solid job for a daily user. Since the iOS 26 update, it heats up like crazy, and is still very fidgety. I like my 13 Mini. It has gotten the job done since 2021. I am not a gamer, not a hardcore photographer, but do use it for audio, YouTube, and the basics. Most, if not all my apps are Google Apps, so I think the transition will be easier, but you never know. I decided to switch because of the following:\n\n* My life does not revolve around the Apple ecosystem (even though I have a Mac)\n* I use Google Apps DAILY\n* Don't give a shit about iMessage or Facetime. I actually HATE any video calls lol.\n* My 13 mini is getting old in technology and super laggy.\n* I was able to get the Pixel 10PRO 256gb for only $2 more a month, AND keep my mini. My new bill is only $64 and I could not pass this deal.\n* If I don't like the Pixel, I can return it, get my money back, and switch back to my mini.\n\nI have a feeling I am going to love the Pixel 10PRO. I am NOT anti iPhone. I am NOT anti Android. I just wanted to try Android again after 13 years. The Pixel 10 Pro fit the bill for what I was looking for. With that being said, the phone arrived today. I will setup later today and report back in a couple weeks. If anyone has some tips, tricks, or suggestions on setting up, please let me know. I have read other threads as well with PRO/ANTI iPhone/Androind content. I thought to myself, guys, it's just a phone... Thank you!",

    "selftext": "Purchased a Pixel 9 about a month ago while on vacation in another country because my previous phone gave out. I noticed that there is a noticeable gap between the screen and the frame (enough to slot a piece of paper in), mostly uniform but slightly more pronounced at the bottom. The screen is also ever so slightly raised up from frame level.\n\nI didn't request for the device to be replaced because I was due to leave for the country I live in in just a few days, also because there was conflicting information online on whether this was normal or not.\n\nI also recently noticed that sometimes there's this faint cluster of pixels flashing green just under the selfie camera cutout (happens only on lower brightness settings), although I'm not sure if it's a hardware issue because I haven't seen it before, and I would definitely have noticed it before if it happened. I don't think it's dead/stuck pixels either because I don't see this happening when I view solid colours on the screen. Also since this phone has a Samsung display and not a BOE one, so the chances are lower. It's usually intermittent but it has stopped happening for now.\n\nI also understand that the gap probably won't void the water resistance because it's not the size of the gap that protects the device, rather the glue under the screen that attaches the display to the frame.\n\nAnyway, I contacted Google support today, and the support agent was more than willing to start an RMA when I asked for it, and said they'd send a brand new replacement. They also said they'd reject the RMA if they found physical damage on my current device.\n\nNow I'm just confused if it's worth attempting an RMA because the phone seems to be working fine and the gap probably doesn't affect water resistance. Besides, there's a couple hairline scratches on the screen, hard to find, but they're there. \n\nI'm afraid the RMA might get rejected because of this and apparently the whole process may take 5-10 business days. Don't want to have to factory reset my phone and wait so long only for it to get rejected.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Does anyone here have experience RMA-ing Pixels in Germany?\n\nPictures of how the gap looks: https://imgur.com/a/GUKiaK1 (zoom in for a better look)",

I paid £400 brand new and retail was £700 (not dollars, UK currency) \n\nthe screen tho… 120hz is so smooth i cant even go back now lol. colours look way better too and the blacks actually look black not that washed out grey iphone screen had. One of the biggest upgrades coming from a very old LCD panel.\n\neveryone always says pixels got bad chips but idk I am not gonna play games on my phone that's what PlayStation is for. It's very optimized and stock android so there are zero performance issues. Phone hasn't stuttered once. Not sure what they’re talking about cuz this thing actually flies. super snappy even with a bunch of apps open. charging is fast too, using an anker 30w cable and its topped up really quickly.\n\nI find myself using Gemini all the time, it's actually really useful, the other ai features are really cool too like the magic eraser and all the other photo and video enhancements.\n\ncamera’s just ridiculous. ultra wide is my fav, barely loses any detail and the pics just look much cleaner and more detailed compared to my old phone.\n\nhonestly didn’t expect it to be this good. coming from an older iphone this feels super refreshing. might actually stick with pixel for a long while. Using android is also very refreshing after looking at basically the same phones and OS for 13 years and it also seems to be much more user friendly in certain aspects, but I do miss some things from iOS but overall it's a great phone. Using the same IOS for years gave me \"apple fatigue\" so this will do for now. \n\n",

    "title": "What To Do When Your Pixel Phone is Stuck in Fastboot Mode [Guide]",
    "selftext": "My Pixel phone got accidentally stuck in fastboot mode, and it was one of the most annoying situations one could get into, where I was stuck with a single message on screen and nothing was working. Even the Google support team was of no great help, and all my data was certain to be lost. Somehow, after a lot of sweat and tears, I was able to crack the problem by collecting little tips from various parts of the internet. As there isn't much helpful advice available, I decided to write a guide post for anyone in the future who gets stuck in a similar situation as mine.\n\n**Note - Skip to the TLDR at the end of the post if you want a simple, direct instruction on how to follow up.**\n\n# Context:\n\nMy Pixel 6a was having issues with the **Volume Down(-)** button, which either seemed to never work or work on its own all of a sudden. Initially, I didn't consider it a big issue until today, when my phone's battery died, and after rebooting, it suddenly entered the infamous Fastboot Mode (I suspect it was because the Volume Down button started acting on its own while simultaneously being pressed with the Power button).\n\nAt first, this didn't seem like a big problem until I realised what the actual mess I was in. My phone didn't seem to do anything, and I was stuck with a single message on screen like[ (this)](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-forums-api/attachment/thread-282377112-7952556128442379489.jpg). With notable information being:\n\n\\- Start message next to the power button\n\n\\- Device status: locked\n\n\\- Enter reason: vol down pressed\n\nNow there was another message next to the volume buttons, which said 'Press the volume keys to select a different menu,' but my device would literally do nothing. It wouldn't change the options when I press the volume keys. Holding the power button would do nothing. The screen would only show this single thing, and nothing would work. It won't even turn on and off. My whole phone was frozen and felt useless. I even let the battery die in the hope that when I would boot it again, everything would go back to normal, but nope, it was still the same screen.\n\n# Google's response:\n\nEventually, I called into Google's helpline to ask for assistance. The Google agent assigned to me was nice but didn't prove to be very helpful as he told me that my phone's software had crashed, from what he could understand on the call, and that I would need to get it repaired from Google's official service centre. Now the problem was that I was in my hometown on vacation, and it would take me another week to go back to the city where their centre is located. That being said, time was still not the major issue because the agent said that there was a 90% chance that all my data would get erased, and that was the dealbreaker for me, cause I didn't want to lose any of the data and memories I had saved in my phone.\n\n# What Worked For Me:\n\nI was really hopeless. But like a drowning man clutching at straws, I was ready to try any advice that might work. On the internet, there was little to no helpful advice available, until I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/s/jijM57t5Af) lifesaver of a Reddit post by u/albogaster, and while I suggest reading the full post, I found these two videos ([ Vid 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTT0_mfCgDc) &[ Vid 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqhlzvzznXM)) by the YT channel **WorldOfTech** to be the most helpful.\n\nThe two videos basically explain to you:\n\n1.[ How to Boot into Android Recovery Menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTT0_mfCgDc)\n\n2.[ How to Exit 'Waiting on Rescue Command'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqhlzvzznXM)\n\nYou can check out both of these videos for your knowledge, but I will be including the tips gathered from these videos in the **'Step-by-Step Tutorial'** section of my **TLDR.**\n\nThere's another important video mentioned in the post ([Vid 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMaoXQkKy_w)) by YT channel **HardReset(dot)Info,** which explains to you how to enter[ Recovery Mode from Fastboot Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMaoXQkKy_w) that you should check out.\n\nNow, I knew what needed to be done, but still, my problem was that **my phone was literally frozen with no buttons working,** unlike the tutorials I had seen, where they at least had the option to navigate through volume buttons. That was until I came across[ this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/11e2jho/comment/ktc4tpt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) comment by u/Forsaken\\_Youth\\_924,1, which said:\n\n\\> hold power and volume up till it vibrates and resets, then hold volume down and power while it's off and click vol up once to get to that weird core command menu and use volume to go up or down, power to select\n\nSo that's what I did, I held the Power button with the Volume Up button for a good amount of 20 seconds, and **it turned off!**\n\nYay!! At least it did something! At least it did something other than being stuck on a single screen!\n\nNow that was progress.\n\nBut it was not long until I was disappointed again, because the next step wouldn't work. Nope. Nothing. It will come back to the same screen again. Tried pressing the Power button + Vol Down button for a good amount of time while it was still off. Didn't work. Tried pressing the Power button alone. Didn't work.\n\nI suspected that it must be because my Vol Down button is not working. But what do I do now? Do I get it repaired first? Is this gonna work at all?\n\nBut then I came across[ this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/11e2jho/comment/ksm7nlj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) other comment under the same thread, which advised to hit the volume down key as hard as you can, **and... it worked!** What in the world?! I didn't even expect the solution to my problem would be this simple. Just banged the Vol Down key across the table as hard as I could, then pressed the Power + Vol Down key while the screen was still off and voila, I was able to navigate the menu using the volume buttons.\n\nNow with that working, I selected the **Recovery Mode** option which bought me to a screen that said **'No Command'** and then using the information from the above videos, I went into the Recovery Mode Menu and selected the **Reboot System option** and finally there I reclaimed my phone from the devil's claw without losing any of my data and without paying the repairing charges.\n\nThanks to both u/albogaster and u/Forsaken\\_Youth\\_9241 without whom this wouldn't have been possible.\n\nFor those who want a step-by-step tutorial, please read the TLDR next.\n\n# TLDR\n\nGot locked into Fastboot mode and here's what helped me:\n\n**The Issue:**\n\n\\- Stuck in Fastboot mode\n\n\\- Not able to navigate in Fastboot mode\n\n\\- Volume Down Key not working\n\n\\- Device state: Locked\n\n\\- Enter reason: Vol down pressed\n\n**Step-by-Step Tutorial:**\n\n**- Step 1:** **Fix the Volume Down Button (if not working):** You gotta get it repaired, or maybe try banging it across the edge of a table really hard (worked for me). I know this sounds silly but it works and it's crucial for our process.\n\n**- Step 2: Reset the Fastboot Navigation setting** **(if not working):** Press and hold the **Power Button** and **Volume Up** button simultaneously for a long time (maybe 20 seconds or more). This will turn off the screen. Now press and hold the **Power button** and **Volume Down button** together. This will **reset** the Fastboot page, and you will now be able to navigate through the volume buttons.\n\n**- Step 3: Exit Fastboot Navigation:** With the volume buttons now working, press **Volume Down** button and navigate towards the **Recovery Mode** (not rescue mode) and press **Power Button** once. A Google logo will pop up, and you'll come across a screen that says **'No Command'**. Now, hold the **Power button** and while you're holding it press the **Volume Up botton 'once’,** and you will see a **menu** pop up.\n\n**- Step 4: Reboot System:** In the menu, navigate to the **'Reboot System Now'** option using the volume keys, and while it's selected, press the **Power button** ‘**once’,** and now it'll boot your screen normally. That's it!\n\nI know this was long, but I hope it was helpful.\n\nThanks.",

    "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI have a second hand Pixel 8 Pro that I bought a month ago and it was working great until I two days ago when I installed an urgent update by Pixel (I believe it was Android 16 (Build Number: BP3A.251005.004.B1). After a day and a half I woke to find my screen flickering and twitching and randomly turning off when I check certain colours or images (I suspect dark mode or anything remotely using dark colours)\n\nHere is a video of the issue: [Screen Flickering - Pixel Pro 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFg0WO_FcLI?si=bFy31aqzQIRG29NI)\n\nI googled the issue as it didn't make sense to me that a hardware issue would cause that in such a context, I suspect it is a software issue. Here is what I tried to no avail:\n\n-Rebooting the phone, even in Safe Mode\n-Taking off the screen protector\n-Disabling \"Smooth Display\" (120hz mode) and lowering the resolution to \"high resolution\"\n-Disabling \"Adaptive Brightness\" and keeping it at 30-40%\n-Accessing the developper options and disabling \"HW Overlays\"\n\nSo as you can see, I virtually tried everything except factory reset which I don't want to do for the time being. I opt-in in the Android Beta Program to see if a Beta OTA Update would help, still waiting for one at the moment.\n\nAt this point I'm worried it is hardware issue and since I live in Morocco I can't send it to Google nor benefit from an extended replacement program that Google provides in supported countries. In worst case scenario I can order a screen replacement from iFixit and see if I can find a repairman here in the local market to install it but before resorting to such a costly course of action, I'd like to see if someone managed to fix this issue before\n\nThank you in advance",

    "selftext": "It's been 3 weeks since my Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold started having multiple problems. It's been 3 weeks since I've been going back an forth with Google over this phone. I bought the phone brand new about 3 months ago and it has been great until these last 3 weeks. These are my problems. \n\n1.      The SIM reader stopped reading my SIM suddenly\n\n2.      The Front screen started glitching and sometimes won’t come on\n\n3.      The phone overheats every time I use it\n\n4.      The phone doesn’t receive charge when unfolded\n\n5.      The camera app causes the phone to hang/crash\n\n6.      If restarted, the phone may not come one until after 12 hours of repeated attempts at turning it on\n\n7.      The phone just goes off on its own.\n\nAt first, Google had me send my phone to a google affiliated repair center who stated that the only problem with the phone was a small scratch and so the warranty had been removed. To fix the phone, I was given a quote for EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!!   \nI requested to have my phone returned and reached out to Google support again. This time, I was asked to take pictures of the phone and send it to the Google support again. The agent looked at the phone and stated that there were scratches to the phone's body, camera and inner screen. What he saw were left over stickies from the phone living in a Spigen body armor. \n\nI spoke to another agent who just cut the phone on me and did not call back. After speaking to 5 different Google support agents, one agent finally agreed to have me send the phone to Google's very own technicians in Warsaw Poland. Within a day, I received a report that there was a dent on the inner screen and that the warranty had been removed and to fix it, I HAD TO PAY A THIRD OF WHAT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!! No report was given with regards the 7 problems the phone had. \n\nIt's been 3 weeks since this problem started, 3 weeks without a phone, 3 weeks of putting my sim in my wife's phone just to check my notifications. 3 weeks of going around in circles with Google support. \n\nStill I haven't gotten any report about the 7 problems with the phone. Before this phone, I've been with Samsung for the past 17 years and I had no problems with their service whatsoever. Honestly I'm starting to regret leaving Samsung. \n\nAt the moment, I still do not have a phone, I'm still going back and forth with Google agents and so far, only one agent has brought up the option of a replacement and for that to occur, they have to check the warranty. \n\nPlease if you have experienced this problem or anything similar, what happens next? Will Google replace the phone? And if the answer is Yes (I hope), how long will it take. \n\nMy productivity has received a massive dent as a result of all this. I have had countless sleepless nights because of this. \n\nGoogle, please, this is not how to treat humans. This is totally unfair. ",

It has gotten the job done since 2021. I am not a gamer, not a hardcore photographer, but do use it for audio, YouTube, and the basics. Most, if not all my apps are Google Apps, so I think the transition will be easier, but you never know. I decided to switch because of the following:\n\n* My life does not revolve around the Apple ecosystem (even though I have a Mac)\n* I use Google Apps DAILY\n* Don't give a shit about iMessage or Facetime. I actually HATE any video calls lol.\n* My 13 mini is getting old in technology and super laggy.\n* I was able to get the Pixel 10PRO 256gb for only $2 more a month, AND keep my mini. My new bill is only $64 and I could not pass this deal.\n* If I don't like the Pixel, I can return it, get my money back, and switch back to my mini.\n\nI have a feeling I am going to love the Pixel 10PRO. I am NOT anti iPhone. I am NOT anti Android. I just wanted to try Android again after 13 years. The Pixel 10 Pro fit the bill for what I was looking for. With that being said, the phone arrived today. I will setup later today and report back in a couple weeks. If anyone has some tips, tricks, or suggestions on setting up, please let me know. I have read other threads as well with PRO/ANTI iPhone/Androind content. I thought to myself, guys, it's just a phone... Thank you!",

    "selftext": "Purchased a Pixel 9 about a month ago while on vacation in another country because my previous phone gave out. I noticed that there is a noticeable gap between the screen and the frame (enough to slot a piece of paper in), mostly uniform but slightly more pronounced at the bottom. The screen is also ever so slightly raised up from frame level.\n\nI didn't request for the device to be replaced because I was due to leave for the country I live in in just a few days, also because there was conflicting information online on whether this was normal or not.\n\nI also recently noticed that sometimes there's this faint cluster of pixels flashing green just under the selfie camera cutout (happens only on lower brightness settings), although I'm not sure if it's a hardware issue because I haven't seen it before, and I would definitely have noticed it before if it happened. I don't think it's dead/stuck pixels either because I don't see this happening when I view solid colours on the screen. Also since this phone has a Samsung display and not a BOE one, so the chances are lower. It's usually intermittent but it has stopped happening for now.\n\nI also understand that the gap probably won't void the water resistance because it's not the size of the gap that protects the device, rather the glue under the screen that attaches the display to the frame.\n\nAnyway, I contacted Google support today, and the support agent was more than willing to start an RMA when I asked for it, and said they'd send a brand new replacement. They also said they'd reject the RMA if they found physical damage on my current device.\n\nNow I'm just confused if it's worth attempting an RMA because the phone seems to be working fine and the gap probably doesn't affect water resistance. Besides, there's a couple hairline scratches on the screen, hard to find, but they're there. \n\nI'm afraid the RMA might get rejected because of this and apparently the whole process may take 5-10 business days. Don't want to have to factory reset my phone and wait so long only for it to get rejected.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Does anyone here have experience RMA-ing Pixels in Germany?\n\nPictures of how the gap looks: https://imgur.com/a/GUKiaK1 (zoom in for a better look)",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

With the advent of Google disabling sideloading of non-verified APKs, one of my first questions was whether or not this would cause issues with the Samsung Store, given that it works parallel to Google's Play Store services.\n\nWould this potentially force Samsung to implement their own verification process for apps on the Samsung Store? or would a majority of the smaller applications simply fork their projects to the Samsung Store as a means to keep them available to Samsung devices?",

(The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra?

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\".

Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "to make a long story short, i work at a computer repair shop, and we often have people come in with cellphones, which we almost always direct over to the local cellphone repair shop. we have an agreement that if we get a cellphone repair request we send them to their shop, and if they get a laptop repair request they send them to our shop\n\nbut with the issues where people are having with samsung galaxy ring batteries swelling, im not sure if i should send them to the cellphone repair shop, or the hospital.\n\nthis isnt a joke meme post, ive just heard that hospitals have a hard time removing the rings because of the nature of the battery in the ring meaning the ring cant just be cut off in the normal way they would a stuck ring, so im really not sure what to do in that situation\n\ni dont have anything much aganst samsung, asside from the annoyance of apps with the appliances my landlord has recently installed in our apartment (im not a fan of needing an app to access all the features of my stove) cause samsung phones are not bad, not the best option in my opinion but if you have the money to spend they are the apple of the android world and so i get it.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "I’ve used the S22 Ultra before and really liked the design and One UI, even though the battery life wasn’t the best. Now I’m looking at the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra and wanted to hear from people who’ve spent time with them.\n\nOn paper they seem very close, but I’m curious about how they actually feel day to day. How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "My 2024 Ultra bound in March this year out of a sudden started having flickering issues, battery drain and such. I tried all the suggested steps to no avail, so i went on the phone with Samsung and mailed my watch in for repair. A week later, i went to check on the status of my repair and it says it's been cancelled. Sure enough, I call again, some support person tells me that I will be contacted within 24 - 72 hours by someone to discuss my options. Long story short, i receive an email today, pretty vague, saying that the watch is not repairable, so they will refund my purchase. I have a Fit 3, but i really got used to all the premium features of the Ultra and the relatively decent battery life. A new 2025 Ultra is almost $700 with tax. I have no idea what was wrong with my watch and now I'm terrified that it might happen again.",

The old watches had to go this way unfortunately, since there was no button to transfer the watch without this. After finishing all of this i cannot find the back up anywhere, nor my purchased things anywhere on the samsung store. Its driving me crazy, this is exactly what i thought would happen. I dont really care for the back up, as much as i care about the watch face ive lost. Ive found an old screenshot(included), i think its called IV style, tho i cannot find it anywhere. \nNow my question is: is there anybody that could help me with getting that watch face back? Doubt that we're able to get the back up, so thats all im asking😆",

    "selftext": "I know the general consensus is that the Watch 7 to 8 upgrade is minimal feature-wise, but I'm specifically asking about **comfort for extended daily wear**.\n\nMy situation:\n\n* Planning to wear it 8+ hours daily at work (mainly for quick voice recording of business ideas, which is really important to me)\n* I'm **very sensitive to wearing anything on my wrist/hands** – my awareness goes to it quickly and it bothers me more easily than general population i imagine.\n* I can have a Watch 7 for $200can vs Watch 8 at $600can+ where I am\n\nI've heard the Watch 8 is 11% thinner with a flatter sensor back, and reviewers say it's \"noticeably more comfortable.\" But I also heard from someone that the Watch 7 \"you don't feel it after a few days\" once you adapt.\n\n**My real question for those who actually owned a Watch 7 and upgraded to the Watch 8:**\n\nIs the comfort difference substantial enough that you'd recommend spending the extra $400 **for someone who's wrist-sensitive**? Or is the Watch 7 comfortable enough on its own vs the Watch 8, even for people like me who are more easily bothered wearing accessories/jewelries?\n\nI'm worried about spending $200 on a Watch 7 and ending up not wearing it because it bothers me – which would be a bigger waste than just getting the 8 upfront. But I also don't want to overspend if the 7 would actually be fine.\n\nAny real-world experience from Watch 7 owners who made the switch would be hugely appreciated. Thanks!",

His account keeps getting barraged with notifications to take control of his Samsung account now that he is 13 (when dismissed they return within seconds). Has anyone accepted 13 yo status for a Samsung account on a standalone GW 7, and if so, did it negatively impact the standalone status of the watch? We don't want to proceed with anything that is irreversible because the watch works great as it is setup. He is okay with this plan, so it is not a matter of honesty, it is a matter of how to get rid of an incredibly annoying notification vs accept the change in status without making the watch unusable as desired. We also use Family Link, and haven't progressed this account yet either, but it is not an issue because we are all in agreement on the supervision rules, and we don't get constant notifications to change the account.

    "selftext": "My 2024 Ultra bound in March this year out of a sudden started having flickering issues, battery drain and such. I tried all the suggested steps to no avail, so i went on the phone with Samsung and mailed my watch in for repair. A week later, i went to check on the status of my repair and it says it's been cancelled. Sure enough, I call again, some support person tells me that I will be contacted within 24 - 72 hours by someone to discuss my options. Long story short, i receive an email today, pretty vague, saying that the watch is not repairable, so they will refund my purchase. I have a Fit 3, but i really got used to all the premium features of the Ultra and the relatively decent battery life. A new 2025 Ultra is almost $700 with tax. I have no idea what was wrong with my watch and now I'm terrified that it might happen again.",

Sure enough, I call again, some support person tells me that I will be contacted within 24 - 72 hours by someone to discuss my options. Long story short, i receive an email today, pretty vague, saying that the watch is not repairable, so they will refund my purchase. I have a Fit 3, but i really got used to all the premium features of the Ultra and the relatively decent battery life. A new 2025 Ultra is almost $700 with tax.

    "selftext": "So I have a lenovo Legion laptop that I purchased a while back and I absolutely love it as far as performance has gone. The issue arose a few weeks ago when the z, x, c, and v keys stopped working periodically and then completely (I'm using the On-Screen Keyboard for those keys atm). After doing some research I found that this isn't that big of a deal and I just needed to change the keyboard which I was able to find and order a reasonably priced replacement of on Ebay. The problem is that when I opened up the laptop to get to work on replacing it, I was able to get all the screws out except one, the one on the motherboard. This one I found the head to be completely stripped out to the point that it's basically just a smooth circle imprint on the head now. I attached an image, it's not of my laptop but this is basically the screw I'm working with but it's almost flat against the motherboard. I'm at a complete loss of what to do or even if taking it to a repair shop is possible because I'm not sure how even a repair tech would deal with something like this. When I asked previously somewhere else I was told to consider using a Dremel tool to cut a small slit that a flathead screwdriver could get into but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to do this with a screw that small and so flat against a motherboard that I'm terrified to even nick. Does anyone have any advice of what to do or know if a typical repair shop would be willing/able to fix such a thing? I know I could use an external keyboard but that kind of defeats the purpose of a laptop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33htavr1tzvf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e631dbd9945552b0778fb68a0348c6a75b041ab\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently upgraded the NVMe SSD in my Acer Nitro Lite 16 NL16-71G (Pearl White). After replacing the drive, I noticed some serious battery issues:\n\n* Laptop **only works when plugged in**.\n* If I unplug the charger, it **shuts down instantly**.\n* Battery shows **stuck at 71%** in Windows and BIOS.\n* The old NVMe works fine when installed temporarily, but now even putting the old SSD back shows the same battery problem.\n* I’ve tried:\n   1. EC reset (disconnect battery + hold power button 40–60 sec)\n   2. Battery calibration (charge full → discharge fully → recharge)\n   3. Reinstalling Windows\n\n**Battery info:**\n\n* Model: HQ24U3S1P5C\n* Manufacturer: UTL\n* Full charge capacity: 42,296 mWh\n* Design capacity: 52,829 mWh\n* Cycle count: 6\n\n**Other details:**\n\n* Windows 11, version 25H2\n* BIOS is latest version\n* Laptop turns on with charger only\n\nI suspect it might be an **EC / battery controller issue triggered by the SSD swap**, but I’m not sure how to fix it.\n\nHas anyone faced something similar? Any advice to get the battery recognized correctly and use the laptop **without being plugged in** would be amazing",

It started not turning off completely when I would shut it down, like it would go through the process but the power wouldn't completely turn off so I would have to hold the power button down to turn it off. Then if I ever turned it off and wanted to turn it back on right away, it started taking a few minutes before it would actually turn on when I press the power button. Now I am in a situation where it is turning on only once the past two days and I don't know if it will turn on again.

It does wake up if i re-open it in less than \\~10 seconds but it does not if it stays closed for longer. It happens on both Windows 11 and Fedora linux.\n\nA weird behavior I noticed is that the first time I open the lid, and it does not wake up, the light on power button pulses as if it was still suspended, if then I close and open again the lid, the light becomes fixed.\n\nAll started once I swapped the old 4x2 memory module to 8x2 (ct102464bf832b.c16fpd) but the momory modules appear to be correctly recognized.\n\nUntil now i tried:\n\n* Different linux kernel (6.14, 6.16 and 6.17)\n* Clean install of Fedora 42, 43 and Windows 11\n* BIOS update\n* Changing power/battery settings\n\nAny ideas to fix?

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m choosing a laptop for my wife, and I’d love unbiased advice from people who used these models in real life.  \nQuick context: she uses the laptop mainly for Excel (large sheets), Teams, PowerPoint, academic research, and writing (PhD). Battery life and long-term reliability are important. I want something that will last many years rather than a quick 2–3 year replacement. She does everything else on her phone, so the laptop will be used solely for academic work. She also needs lots of storage for research materials (mostly video), but I’ll handle that by adding a second M.2 SSD (2–4 TB).\n\nTwo options I’m comparing (basic specs, no links):  \n1) **Lenovo ThinkBook 16 G8 (SKU 21SHA02PPB)—Intel** Core Ultra 5-210H, 16 GB DDR5, 512 GB SSD, 16\" WUXGA (1920×1200), 300 nits. The listing doesn’t clearly state the battery for this SKU; it could be 45 Wh or 71 Wh. Price \\~€636\n\n2) **Lenovo ThinkPad E16 Gen 2 (SKU 21M5001YPB)—AMD** Ryzen 5 7535HS, 16 GB DDR5, 512 GB SSD, 16\" WUXGA, listed battery 57 Wh. Price \\~€871\n\nThanks in advance; please enlighten me with your superior experience; I’ll gladly follow the community’s judgment.",

    "selftext": "I have a ThinkPad P16s with a GPU. Last week it was not turning on so I opened it up to reset the BIOS (it fixed the issue). While I was doing that, I saw that the thermal paste on both the CPU and GPU was completely solid and crusty. I was surprised, since the laptop is less than 6 months old. I do some pretty CPU and GPU intensive gaming and I use it a lot for 3d renders for engineering, but I thought repasting was supposed to be maybe once a year at most. Does the paste drying out this quick indicate a bigger problem, or is this just normal?",

Ideally it should have a decent-enough battery, like 4–5 hours for work when I’m not at home(charger not plugged in), and at least 12–16GB of ram and 8gb of gpu. I’d like to run stuff like modded Terraria, CS:GO, and modded Minecraft, nothing too heavy, at around 120fps, but 60fps is fine too. Don’t care if it’s loud or not. When I would game I would always game whit charger plugged in. \nBudget is around €650 max, maybe €700 if there’s something really worth it.\n",

If indifferent, put N/A.\nBetween 15–17”. Prefer 16” if possible — good balance between portability and screen space.\n\n\t•\tAre you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\nYes — light photo editing (Photoshop, Lightroom), occasional video editing (Premiere, DaVinci Resolve), and gaming (Minecraft with shaders/mods).\n\n\t•\tIf you’re gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\nMainly Minecraft, ideally smooth at high/ultra settings with shaders, and maybe some casual titles like Valorant or GTA V at 1080p/1440p 60+ FPS.\n\n\t•\tAny specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\nA comfortable keyboard (for university work), good display (color accuracy for editing), and reliable thermals. Don’t need a touchscreen or fingerprint reader.\n\n\t•\tLeave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\nI’ve already found two options from Lenovo that fit my budget, but I’m unsure which one is the better pick or if there’s a better alternative from ASUS, MSI, or HP:\n\n1️⃣ Lenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 10 (16”, AMD)\n\t•\tRyzen 7 8745HX\n\t•\tRTX 5060 (8 GB GDDR7)\n\t•\t32 GB DDR5\n\t•\t1 TB SSD\n\t•\t16” WQXGA (2560×1600) OLED 165 Hz 500 nits\n👉 ~1,372 €\n\n2️⃣ Lenovo LOQ 17i Gen 10 (17”, Intel)\n\t•\ti7-14700HX\n\t•\tRTX 5070 (8 GB GDDR7)\n\t•\t32 GB DDR5\n\t•\t1 TB SSD\n\t•\t17.3” FHD 165 Hz IPS\n👉 ~1,393 €\n\nI’ll mainly use the laptop for university, Minecraft, and some creative work — so I’m torn between the Legion’s OLED screen and the LOQ’s stronger GPU.\nAny thoughts or better suggestions in this price range would be super helpful 🙏\n",

I really need a computer to work (I'm a student) and I thought buying a laptop so I can connect it to my phone for wifi, but I know nothing about laptops, how do I choose one? What is a good price? I use drawing and coding programs (might play but nothing to fancy). I do not have to much money (I don't see myself buy a 1200€ laptop). Do you have any recommendations?",

    "selftext": "Experienced a tragedy a few months after getting my new Samsung Galaxybook alongside a lovely Stadler Norris jumbo pen for notetaking for uni only for me to drop it off the bed while pulling an all nighter for an assignment (biggest regret of my life). The LCD screen doesn't seem to show signs of damage as of yet but the cracks are quite central on the screen and I'm sure they're growing even if I haven't seen anything noticeable yet, I also can't use the pen for note-taking anymore as I don't want to destroy the screen anymore. The problem is this laptop was a replacement for a normal Samsung Galaxybook 4 (with touchscreen), it's screen also broke but from sitting in my bag, I got this screen replaced for £500 after a long wait and when i opened up the laptop after leaving it in a cupboard for a while the screen had broken again and wouldn't turn on. This is apparently a manufacturing error that Samsung refuses to acknowledge but I'm not sure if it applied to my screen or I'm just clumsy, either way multiple complaints about phantom screen cracking.\n\nObviously a large part of this is user error but I'm truly obsessed with this laptop and I know if it wasn't for the screen issue it could last me a long long time, I can even play a couple of games on it here or there which I've never done before and the writing feature is excellent. I have a student allowance due to a disability and have been offered the chance to purchase a subsidised laptop (£200 as the standard price) and I have the chance to upgrade it if I wish to. One option available to me is the MSI Cyborg 15 with intel i5 12450H , 16GB of RAM and RTX 3050 Mobile which I would pay £429 for.\n\nI mean for studying purposes the subsidised laptop does seem like the sensible option if I want to have a quality functioning laptop that will last but I really do enjoy the user experience of my Samsung, it was also a gift for me and the pen was a feature I thoroughly benefited from using. I really don't know what option to pick, I'm scared the screen of the Samsung will just break again and I'll have to pay for another repair. Alternatively my subsidised laptop will have Warrantee paid for me so that won't be a big fear. I don't really understand how the laptop subsidising works but I do have the option of picking something else as long as it's above £600 but idk what would be worth the money as most 2 in 1 laptops are either expensive or just bad  ",

    "selftext": "Hello. After a few years of using a used (and beloved) Lenovo ThinkPad T570, my priorities have changed and I need a new laptop. The T570 will go to my parents. For context, I am 25 years old, a teacher and I try to keep my needs basic: PDF, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Zoom, watching videos etc. Very normal stuff that do not require a tank of a device to function. But, now, since I'm evolving in my profession, I'd like a new device to carry me for the next few years (or as long as possible). Very important: I want it to be 14 inches. \n\nSince I'm incapable of giving birth to endless amounts of money, giving 3k for a laptop is out the window. So, my question is, what's a really good, solid choice for a second-hand laptop that I can use and is, preferably, upgradable and easily repairable? I am aware that newer laptops do not have the best reputation for repairability & upgradability, BUT if there is a solid 2024/2025 option, I am willing to take a look. My budget is maybe 1.5-2k AT MOST. 2K is a very big stretch. That's why my first thought is second-hand since they are less than 1k. \n\nThanks and take care. :)",

    "title": "I need advice for a stripped screw.",
    "selftext": "So I have a lenovo Legion laptop that I purchased a while back and I absolutely love it as far as performance has gone. The issue arose a few weeks ago when the z, x, c, and v keys stopped working periodically and then completely (I'm using the On-Screen Keyboard for those keys atm). After doing some research I found that this isn't that big of a deal and I just needed to change the keyboard which I was able to find and order a reasonably priced replacement of on Ebay. The problem is that when I opened up the laptop to get to work on replacing it, I was able to get all the screws out except one, the one on the motherboard. This one I found the head to be completely stripped out to the point that it's basically just a smooth circle imprint on the head now. I attached an image, it's not of my laptop but this is basically the screw I'm working with but it's almost flat against the motherboard. I'm at a complete loss of what to do or even if taking it to a repair shop is possible because I'm not sure how even a repair tech would deal with something like this. When I asked previously somewhere else I was told to consider using a Dremel tool to cut a small slit that a flathead screwdriver could get into but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to do this with a screw that small and so flat against a motherboard that I'm terrified to even nick. Does anyone have any advice of what to do or know if a typical repair shop would be willing/able to fix such a thing? I know I could use an external keyboard but that kind of defeats the purpose of a laptop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33htavr1tzvf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e631dbd9945552b0778fb68a0348c6a75b041ab\n\n",

Battery life and long-term reliability are important. I want something that will last many years rather than a quick 2–3 year replacement. She does everything else on her phone, so the laptop will be used solely for academic work. She also needs lots of storage for research materials (mostly video), but I’ll handle that by adding a second M.2 SSD (2–4 TB).\n\nTwo options I’m comparing (basic specs, no links):  \n1) **Lenovo ThinkBook 16 G8 (SKU 21SHA02PPB)—Intel** Core Ultra 5-210H, 16 GB DDR5, 512 GB SSD, 16\" WUXGA (1920×1200), 300 nits.

If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-15 inches\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming?

    "selftext": "So I have a lenovo Legion laptop that I purchased a while back and I absolutely love it as far as performance has gone. The issue arose a few weeks ago when the z, x, c, and v keys stopped working periodically and then completely (I'm using the On-Screen Keyboard for those keys atm). After doing some research I found that this isn't that big of a deal and I just needed to change the keyboard which I was able to find and order a reasonably priced replacement of on Ebay. The problem is that when I opened up the laptop to get to work on replacing it, I was able to get all the screws out except one, the one on the motherboard. This one I found the head to be completely stripped out to the point that it's basically just a smooth circle imprint on the head now. I attached an image, it's not of my laptop but this is basically the screw I'm working with but it's almost flat against the motherboard. I'm at a complete loss of what to do or even if taking it to a repair shop is possible because I'm not sure how even a repair tech would deal with something like this. When I asked previously somewhere else I was told to consider using a Dremel tool to cut a small slit that a flathead screwdriver could get into but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to do this with a screw that small and so flat against a motherboard that I'm terrified to even nick. Does anyone have any advice of what to do or know if a typical repair shop would be willing/able to fix such a thing? I know I could use an external keyboard but that kind of defeats the purpose of a laptop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33htavr1tzvf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e631dbd9945552b0778fb68a0348c6a75b041ab\n\n",

    "title": "First timer (ever) attempting to get a gaming pc - $600-750",
    "selftext": "As the title said, besides being the 1st time I actually post something on reddit, and after seeing a couple posts here and there. I wanted to give this a try to see if I could get some assistance. \n\nThis would be my first time getting a gaming pc. I've never had the chance, and although I understand that my budget is not good enough, this is what about I could gather. \n\nMy plan is to get this PC before the end of the year, and I was thinking on buying all at once, but after reading some posts asking for something similar, I understood the difference between $600 and $700-750'ish (more than so cause of the graphic card. I know a bit for laptops, but I failed to grasp what's good in PCs for what I'm aiming for). So I decided to request for help here and start buying part by part. That way I can ease the burden a bit and expand my budget since it would be a slow and steady purchase throughout the following months (understanding that prices might vary). \n\nKey details about this are:\n\n- Budget $750 max. \n- I would like to try out some games like Rivals, or popular and newer shooters games like Battlefield 6, Arc Raiders, perhaps sport games, and some others like Final Fantasy, Monster Hunter, etc. \n- I don't live in the US, however, I have no issues making purchases in Amazon, Walmart, etc. The only issue is that any part priced at $200 or higher will come with an uncomfortable tax to get it shipped, but that's fine. I'm not counting those taxes in the initial budget. \n- I'm not picky about the graphics, if I need to reduce the shadows and so on, it's fine. But I do want it to look nice at least (if possible), and more importantly play without worrying about lag. \n- A future plan is to dig in into rendering and designing, but even I know my budget wouldn't allow me to go far, but at least I want to dip my pinky finger into that pond to see what I can do. \n\nI fully understand that my ignorence about this might have created outrageous requests for such a low budget, so I'm totally to open to learn and understand the reality of what I can actually get. Above I just pointed out what I would like, but I also understand that I might need to compromise on either much lower expectations or just straight up increase my budget. \n\nI'm very sorry for the long text, I've never been good keeping things short to the point.\n\nThank you in advance for any tip, assistance or links you could provide to point me in the right direction. I know there's a website where you can pick the parts, but I know nothing about pc parts, so I didn't know how to link one part with another. I just don't understand what graphic card would do for what I want, and what motherboard would link to it. ",

It seemed like the only way to make this work was to remove the fans from the radiator and mount them on the other side, kind of squeezing the fan mounts of the case between the two - if that makes sense? \n\nHere's some photos to hopefully illustrate what I mean: https://imgur.com/a/xc8EFTb\n\nI've booted up and everything seems to be working fine? Idle temps are below 40C on my 9800x3D but haven't run any benchmarks.\n\nIs this an OK approach?

    "selftext": "I am building a PC for general home use, plus a fair amount of photo/video editing using Lightroom and some other video editing software. My kid plays Minecraft, MS Flight Simulator, Universe Sandbox, and some other games on Steam. I might get into some light PC gaming, but clearly not looking to build a gaming PC. So far I have bought the following:\n\n1. CPU - Intel Core Ultra 7 for $269.99 from my local Microcenter\n2. RAM - TeamGroup T-Create 64G (2x32G) 6000MTS/CL36 DDR5 for $184.99 from my local Microcenter\n3. MOBO - ASUS TUF Z890-PLUS WIFI for $199.99 (shipped/sold by Amazon), hasn't shipped yet\n4. PSU - Corsair RM850x for $134.99\n\nI am also considering ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce 5070Ti for $849.99 from Amazon (haven't bought yet, and not in a rush to buy).\n\nToday when I was at my local Microcenter, I noticed that they had Intel Core Ultra 7 + Asus Z890 AYW mobo for $349.99, which I thought was a pretty good deal.\n\n  \nShould I cancel my ASUS TUF Z890 (bought from Amazon, but hasn't shipped yet), and get the above bundle from Microcenter? I would save around $120. What are the pros and cons of TUF vs AYW? I really like the specs and the looks of TUF Z890, but mostly care amount reliability. I am not familiar with the ASUS AYW mobo. My current PC which I built 12 years ago has an older i7+Asus TUF mobo, and I have never had any issue whatsoever with it. That is why I opted to go with the Z890-TUF. At the same time, there is the TUF Z890 PRO on Amazon for $240. Should I go with this? If you have any other suggestion for my build, please feel free to chime in. Please do NOT recommend AMD - not going that route.",

    "selftext": "Hi! For some reference, I am venezuelan and will have to pay import fees on all of this, for your suggestions keep in mind I have a total budget of more or less $1000;\n\n* CPU: Ryzen 5 8600g - reasoning: I intend to buy pieces in batches and will probably buy the GPU last as it may or may not be the most expensive component in this build list, so integrated graphics to tide me over would be an asset\n* Motherboard: ASUS TUF Gaming A620M-PLUS - Reasoning: my entrypoint to AM5 and DDR5, I'm not sure if I can find a more cost effective board that still keeps me in AM5 territory.\n* Boot drive: Samsung 990 EVO Plus SSD 1TB - I intend to split this 15/85 into a boot and game partitions \n* GPU: Undecided between a RTX3070 and a 2080, and upgrading beyond that will take a while. \n* Case: I think I'm going to go with an open bench case rather than a box, and I'm gonna drill it to hold onto the wall my desk is at so i can keep an eye on it and remind myself to clean it regularly\n* Power supply: I'm actually not sure what power supply i'll need to go with when including the GPU consumption into the budget, but i'd prefer not to have to buy a new one when i do get the GPU. \n* Aux power: We get frequent power cuts at least every other day in this country, so I'll definitely need a PSU of some sort to ensure my components don't die any time soon. That'll go on a different budget, but if anyone here has suggestions that won't break the bank they'll be welcome.\n* Screens: I actually have no idea what budget screens are good/decent and what is garbage, so i'll appreciate advice there. I'm not interested in 4k and I see 2k as reasonable, but I am perfectly fine with gaming in 1080p.\n* CPU Cooling: I was thinking of a simple Noctua NH-U9S, though temps here do get high year round to 31-32 degrees cels (in the 90s in fahrenheit) so maybe an AIO in a similar pricerange can also make the cut. I will be buying noctua thermal paste as well. \n* RAM: Probably going with a PNY kit like this one PNY XLR8 Gaming 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5 RAM 5600MHz CL46-45-45-90 1.1V\n\nI don't believe I'm missing anything here, as I already have a mouse and keyboard that i will keep, looking forwards to suggestions/corrections! I am also open to AMD and Intel cards for the GPU options, as well as changing the CPU so long as we remain within a close-enough princerange to what the 8600G can be found for. ",

I've been browsing the web for that and couldn't find the direct answers, but i've seen some in photos with some pc builds with Dark Rock Pro 4 on Fractal Design Meshify 2, where the max CPU cooler declared as 170 mm, but Dark Rock Pro 4 is 163 mm and there was literally centimeters of space left till the case's border.

I always get paranoid when I could possibly be causing damage to my pc, thanks",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'm getting ready to build a new PC for the very first time, I'm getting the following specs from a tech store:\n- Motherboard: Gigabyte B650 Eagle AX, AM5, DDR5\n- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 - 8400F 4.7Ghz\n- GPU: zotac rtx5060 Ti gddr7 16gb (ZT-B50620H-10M)\n- RAM: 2X 16GB ddr5 Kingston fury, 5600mhz\n-power supply: xzeal xz650 650w, 80+ bronze\n\nI'd like to have it upgraded in about 8-12 months tops, as to have the RAM increased to 64GB, and not sure if the CPU aswell. \nPersonally... I'm an Asus ROG fanboy, so i'd like to have the motherboard in that scope, I've seen the Asus ROG strix b850F wifi, but no idea if it's worth it, or which model would best suit the build.\n\nI'm not a 4k/fps/ultra settings hyper fixation person, but a high/2k would be the goal for me at this moment.\n\nI had a gaming laptop, and felt at ease with it, but the MB died and the replacement if quite expensive, plus not having a good tech store to actually repair it properly. That laptops specs were: G513QY, advantage edition, Ryzen 9 5900HX, RX6800 12GB, 64GB (year not quite sure, probably 2021?).\n\nWill the proposed build at the store be an upgrade or an equal match for the lost laptop? What would you recommend me to change in that build?\n The store build is around $1300 USD, but I'm thinking about getting an extra $500-$600 usd budget for an initial investment.\n\nGames to play: Space Marine 2, Alan Wake 2, Stellar Blade, Silent Hill 2 Remake, Helldivers 2, Elden Ring.\n\nThanks in advance for any feedback!\n",

    "selftext": "Currently on R5 3600, B450m steel legend, 16GB 3200 CL16 and a 5600XT. I would like to take the once in a couple years chance to upgrade my rig.\n\nI have the option of the following for CPU upgrades:  \n\\- a 5700X3D for about **$240**, it's been used for 1 year and the price may be slightly negotiable  \n\\- a 5800XT for **$235**  \n\\- a 5800X for **$205** (17% cheaper than the X3D)  \n\\- a 5700X for **$140** (nearly half the price of the (new) X3D)\n\nI initially aimed for the 5700X3D to cap off my AM4 build, as I want this upgrade to last me for the foreseeable future (probably until the second gen of AM6 before I consider upgrading again), I'll also buy a DDR4 32GB kit for around $75 and plan to buy a 9060XT on sales season next month.\n\nThe prequel to this question was whether I was gonna go for AM5 or stay on AM4, which I have largely solved and moved past; the cheapest 7500F bundle I could find with a non-garbage B650 mobo and 32GB of 6000 CL30 DDR5 will still be atleast $100 more than going with the 5700X3D and 32GB DDR4, and if I were to imagine what the sales would be like next month where I live, AM5 would still be like $60 more expensive at best. In both cases It's hard to afford that price difference especially in a single month.\n\nSo right now I'm content with staying on AM4 but also malding because I realized how ridiculous the 5700X3D price increase is and finding it second-hand is harder than I thought; I had initially planned to buy one for around $190-$200 used but I'm not sure if I can find any offers like this now. So while dooming about the price going even higher I thought I'd take your opinions on getting one of the non-3D cache options instead.\n\n**I play on 1080p**, and expect the upgrade to run games consistently at 120fps+ on a mix of high and max settings, mainly newer games like MH Wilds, Expedition 33, BF6 and future games of the same level maybe down to 100fps minimum.\n\nGetting the 5700X3D seemed like the obvious choice with 1080p and gives the least likelihood of bottlenecking any GPU upgrades I might get later. But I don't know if other options will also do the same job, another important thing I wanna point out is that **my B450 motherboard only supports up to 3200MHz RAM Speed**, so I won't be able to hit 3600MHz for what it's worth.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Or should I downgrade to the most recent non-Beta Version?**\n\n\n\n`Also, I tried getting to solve the Issue with ChatGPT and he said that I probably broke it, or it was alr broken before, since when I used the Bios Flash Button on the back I had that CPU installed. He said its incredibly rare but it might've happend to me. When I did it while the Installation it was alr giving me the CPU Debug Lights and then it just never turned on.

But when attempting to do so, I ran into clearance issues with my GPU (5080 FE). It seemed like the only way to make this work was to remove the fans from the radiator and mount them on the other side, kind of squeezing the fan mounts of the case between the two - if that makes sense? \n\nHere's some photos to hopefully illustrate what I mean: https://imgur.com/a/xc8EFTb\n\nI've booted up and everything seems to be working fine? Idle temps are below 40C on my 9800x3D but haven't run any benchmarks.\n\nIs this an OK approach? I guess my concern is that the fans are not 100% directly mounted against the radiator because there's at least some (albeit minimal) additional space from the case mount between them. ",

That way I can ease the burden a bit and expand my budget since it would be a slow and steady purchase throughout the following months (understanding that prices might vary). \n\nKey details about this are:\n\n- Budget $750 max. \n- I would like to try out some games like Rivals, or popular and newer shooters games like Battlefield 6, Arc Raiders, perhaps sport games, and some others like Final Fantasy, Monster Hunter, etc. \n- I don't live in the US, however, I have no issues making purchases in Amazon, Walmart, etc. The only issue is that any part priced at $200 or higher will come with an uncomfortable tax to get it shipped, but that's fine. I'm not counting those taxes in the initial budget. \n- I'm not picky about the graphics, if I need to reduce the shadows and so on, it's fine. But I do want it to look nice at least (if possible), and more importantly play without worrying about lag. \n- A future plan is to dig in into rendering and designing, but even I know my budget wouldn't allow me to go far, but at least I want to dip my pinky finger into that pond to see what I can do. \n\nI fully understand that my ignorence about this might have created outrageous requests for such a low budget, so I'm totally to open to learn and understand the reality of what I can actually get. Above I just pointed out what I would like, but I also understand that I might need to compromise on either much lower expectations or just straight up increase my budget. \n\nI'm very sorry for the long text, I've never been good keeping things short to the point.\n\nThank you in advance for any tip, assistance or links you could provide to point me in the right direction. I know there's a website where you can pick the parts, but I know nothing about pc parts, so I didn't know how to link one part with another. I just don't understand what graphic card would do for what I want, and what motherboard would link to it. ",

PSU - Corsair RM850x for $134.99\n\nI am also considering ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce 5070Ti for $849.99 from Amazon (haven't bought yet, and not in a rush to buy).\n\nToday when I was at my local Microcenter, I noticed that they had Intel Core Ultra 7 + Asus Z890 AYW mobo for $349.99, which I thought was a pretty good deal.\n\n  \nShould I cancel my ASUS TUF Z890 (bought from Amazon, but hasn't shipped yet), and get the above bundle from Microcenter? I would save around $120. What are the pros and cons of TUF vs AYW? I really like the specs and the looks of TUF Z890, but mostly care amount reliability. I am not familiar with the ASUS AYW mobo. My current PC which I built 12 years ago has an older i7+Asus TUF mobo, and I have never had any issue whatsoever with it. That is why I opted to go with the Z890-TUF. At the same time, there is the TUF Z890 PRO on Amazon for $240. Should I go with this? If you have any other suggestion for my build, please feel free to chime in. Please do NOT recommend AMD - not going that route.",

    "selftext": "Hi! For some reference, I am venezuelan and will have to pay import fees on all of this, for your suggestions keep in mind I have a total budget of more or less $1000;\n\n* CPU: Ryzen 5 8600g - reasoning: I intend to buy pieces in batches and will probably buy the GPU last as it may or may not be the most expensive component in this build list, so integrated graphics to tide me over would be an asset\n* Motherboard: ASUS TUF Gaming A620M-PLUS - Reasoning: my entrypoint to AM5 and DDR5, I'm not sure if I can find a more cost effective board that still keeps me in AM5 territory.\n* Boot drive: Samsung 990 EVO Plus SSD 1TB - I intend to split this 15/85 into a boot and game partitions \n* GPU: Undecided between a RTX3070 and a 2080, and upgrading beyond that will take a while. \n* Case: I think I'm going to go with an open bench case rather than a box, and I'm gonna drill it to hold onto the wall my desk is at so i can keep an eye on it and remind myself to clean it regularly\n* Power supply: I'm actually not sure what power supply i'll need to go with when including the GPU consumption into the budget, but i'd prefer not to have to buy a new one when i do get the GPU. \n* Aux power: We get frequent power cuts at least every other day in this country, so I'll definitely need a PSU of some sort to ensure my components don't die any time soon. That'll go on a different budget, but if anyone here has suggestions that won't break the bank they'll be welcome.\n* Screens: I actually have no idea what budget screens are good/decent and what is garbage, so i'll appreciate advice there. I'm not interested in 4k and I see 2k as reasonable, but I am perfectly fine with gaming in 1080p.\n* CPU Cooling: I was thinking of a simple Noctua NH-U9S, though temps here do get high year round to 31-32 degrees cels (in the 90s in fahrenheit) so maybe an AIO in a similar pricerange can also make the cut. I will be buying noctua thermal paste as well. \n* RAM: Probably going with a PNY kit like this one PNY XLR8 Gaming 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5 RAM 5600MHz CL46-45-45-90 1.1V\n\nI don't believe I'm missing anything here, as I already have a mouse and keyboard that i will keep, looking forwards to suggestions/corrections! I am also open to AMD and Intel cards for the GPU options, as well as changing the CPU so long as we remain within a close-enough princerange to what the 8600G can be found for. ",

I've been browsing the web for that and couldn't find the direct answers, but i've seen some in photos with some pc builds with Dark Rock Pro 4 on Fractal Design Meshify 2, where the max CPU cooler declared as 170 mm, but Dark Rock Pro 4 is 163 mm and there was literally centimeters of space left till the case's border. I'd really love to stick with the Lian Li, so I am curious would the Dark Rock Pro 5 fit in that? Must say in advance - I am not interested in AIO. Hope you will help to clarify this out",

I guess my concern is that the fans are not 100% directly mounted against the radiator because there's at least some (albeit minimal) additional space from the case mount between them. ",

    "selftext": "As the title said, besides being the 1st time I actually post something on reddit, and after seeing a couple posts here and there. I wanted to give this a try to see if I could get some assistance. \n\nThis would be my first time getting a gaming pc. I've never had the chance, and although I understand that my budget is not good enough, this is what about I could gather. \n\nMy plan is to get this PC before the end of the year, and I was thinking on buying all at once, but after reading some posts asking for something similar, I understood the difference between $600 and $700-750'ish (more than so cause of the graphic card. I know a bit for laptops, but I failed to grasp what's good in PCs for what I'm aiming for). So I decided to request for help here and start buying part by part. That way I can ease the burden a bit and expand my budget since it would be a slow and steady purchase throughout the following months (understanding that prices might vary). \n\nKey details about this are:\n\n- Budget $750 max. \n- I would like to try out some games like Rivals, or popular and newer shooters games like Battlefield 6, Arc Raiders, perhaps sport games, and some others like Final Fantasy, Monster Hunter, etc. \n- I don't live in the US, however, I have no issues making purchases in Amazon, Walmart, etc. The only issue is that any part priced at $200 or higher will come with an uncomfortable tax to get it shipped, but that's fine. I'm not counting those taxes in the initial budget. \n- I'm not picky about the graphics, if I need to reduce the shadows and so on, it's fine. But I do want it to look nice at least (if possible), and more importantly play without worrying about lag. \n- A future plan is to dig in into rendering and designing, but even I know my budget wouldn't allow me to go far, but at least I want to dip my pinky finger into that pond to see what I can do. \n\nI fully understand that my ignorence about this might have created outrageous requests for such a low budget, so I'm totally to open to learn and understand the reality of what I can actually get. Above I just pointed out what I would like, but I also understand that I might need to compromise on either much lower expectations or just straight up increase my budget. \n\nI'm very sorry for the long text, I've never been good keeping things short to the point.\n\nThank you in advance for any tip, assistance or links you could provide to point me in the right direction. I know there's a website where you can pick the parts, but I know nothing about pc parts, so I didn't know how to link one part with another. I just don't understand what graphic card would do for what I want, and what motherboard would link to it. ",

    "selftext": "**Greetings, everyone!**\n\nOur upcoming project - a medieval RPG **Legacy of Valor** \\- is on Kickstarter, and we've already surpassed our first stretch goal.\n\nBut first, I'd like to introduce you to the game itself.\n\n**Legacy of Valor** is a medieval RPG that blends **castle building**, **territory management**, **large-scale battles**, and a **story-driven narrative** into one immersive experience. In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Husák! 😊), but soon, **thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his **passion, enthusiasm, and desire** are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Husák himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to **expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile – and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point, **we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that **Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*“Hey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors — If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you’re gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step — launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign — just like old times — and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let’s rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let’s build that castle from the ground up — together.”*\n\nWe can’t express how much this means to us. **Warhorse Studios inspired us** \\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives **Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let’s carry this legacy forward. **Together!**\n\nKickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit: [r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX: [https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website: [https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

    "title": "I will Never use Humble Bundle Again",
    "selftext": "I purchased Ryse: Son of Rome on August 29th. This was the first time I ever purchased from Humble Bundle. At the time and to this day, I have not seen a banner on Humble's store indicating they are out of keys for Ryse: Son of Rome. I am using Chrome and not running any ad blocker, so I suspect this is not an issue with my personal browser. These banners are referenced in Humble's FAQ on key exhaustion. I have exchanged 3 messages with humble support inquiring about the lack of a banner and if the 60-day refund window applies if I have not received a key. Not only did they take on average 7 days to respond they also talked around my questions and provided no real support. I am willing to give a great deal of leeway, after all, this is for charity. That said, the dishonesty or ineptitude of the support team and the implication that Humble can keep my money and provide me with nothing in return just leaves me with a gross feeling that I can't shake. I will never use this storefront again. I have only ever heard good things about Humble. Am I just phenomenally unlucky, or is this a common experience no one talks about?",

Somewhere.\n\nThe biggest twist, is that the battles are fewer, but longer, with new enemies spawning, dropping loot, and allowing you to craft DURING combat.\n\nIt's a bit like an OVA anime from a larger universe.\n\nWe launched in April, but the game is on sale now, and we added a real nice update during the Autumn sale, so I thought I'd give it a try and tell you about the game.\n\nDesign-wise, I tried to focus on having fewer, but more tactically worthwhile spells, and enemies that are mechanically interesting.\n\nSince launch we've put out a few free updates, and hope to make more. Of note is the extra difficult secret level in the final world. We're very attentive to feedback, and the last update was about helping players deal with how they experienced randomness.\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, both the good and the bad stuff.",

    "selftext": "Just now I was playing mafia 2. I am 9 hours into the game and I started the game with hard difficulty like I have started to do with all of my games recently. I have come at a level that is simply impossible to cross, not because of any skill issue but simply because this game has a bad 'Hard' difficulty mode.\n\nThere are games where hard difficulty simply means a basic buff to all enemies. They function like normal npc's but their damaged is increased, they spot you unreasonably fast, and even their pistols shoot kilometers (miles) away and it takes a takes a whole mag to kill one enemy. Your gameplay does not change. You still take cover and shoot, you simply stay in cover for longer, and have to shoot the same enemy twice as much, but its the same.\n\nIn this particular mission in mafia, the enemies are just unfair. Rather than enemies coordinating better, they and their guns have simply been buffed. And I am not lying when I say this, I cannot shoot a Thompson at my target after a certain distance because of insane recoil, my enemies, with that same Thompson, are killing me with 2 bullets from twice that distance. Molotov cocktails fall in front of my cover but I still get damage, and the most baffling part is that I get some damage even behind covers.\n\nThis is a bad hard mode, although understandable because the game came out in 2010. In such a mode, you can overcome with skill only to be lead to such an instance where skill can not overcome the bad design. Like how my enemy keeps throwing molotovs every 5 seconds in a small space filled with constantly spawning enemies, I peak and someone shoots me, I play smart and get killed by a Molotov that isint even near me.\n\nI am also playing wolfenstein currently and it has a much better hard mode. Its actually challenging but most of all, its reasonably challenging, you can improve and get better or retry until you finally clear a level. Enemy damage does increase but they don't turn into bullet sponges, enemies coordinate better and have better reflexes rather than being one shot kill. In Wolfenstein you just have to plan better, remember the med kits and the Armour and use them strategically. But mafia 2 doesnt offer me any such option, the gameplay is yet the same regardless of difficulty.",

When you can rent game by getting 1 month of pc game pass (15 € after price hike which is still reasonable). The game has about 12 hours of content from what I've seen.\n\n  \nAnd down the line if you wanna replay it you can probably buy it for much lower price on sale anyway. Just don't get paying 80 € for game. \n\nFYI: for some reason some companies are pricing games at 70 $/80 €, while others are doing 70 $/70 €. ",

We initially made this as a sequel to Liminascent, our previous first-person platformer, and renamed it because here in France \"Liminascent\" isn't easy to pronounce...\n\nWell, we had a ton of fun making the game as a side project (besides our boring main jobs), and we are excited to see people playing the demo. It's our first solo project on Steam, as we already released a game with a publisher, but now we want more freedom, hence the self-publishing. We'd be more than happy to get feedback on the game, see what you like, what you dislike so we can enhance it and hopefully make something great in the long run! We're aiming for a release by the end of the year, as most of the \"complete\" game is ready.\n\nThe demo here is just a part of the complete game, to get the feeling of it and see if it's for you. We will probably keep the demo up permanently, as we believe it's better to be able to try a game before buying it.\n\nThat's it! Hope you'll enjoy it.

If you're looking for a roguelike, say that. If your game must include zombies, you should probably mention that. The more detailed you are the better the recommendations will be.\n* Are you limited by PC specifications or a budget? That's all good stuff to include.\n\nLooking for game suggestions every day of the week? Try our [Discord!](https://discord.gg/r-pcgaming-482363499977375785)",

    "selftext": "**Hey, r/pcgaming!**\n\n**I’m Louis Denizet, game director at** [Hibernian Workshop](https://hibernian-workshop.com/)**, the indie studio behind the roguelite** [Astral Ascent](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280930/Astral_Ascent/) **— and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have!**\n\nI started the studio years ago after meeting Alexandre Magnat online — we were both self-taught and completely obsessed with pixel art, especially the kind you see in anime across different eras and styles. \n\nWhat followed after a few years since this match was Astral Ascent, a colorful, fast-paced roguelite in the vein of Dead Cells with a focus on fluid combat, replayability (with 5 unique characters to choose from), and wrapped up in a pixel art style that’s by now become a signature of our work. \n\nIt wasn’t our first game, but it’s the one where we finally found our footing. A bright fantasy with an underlying melancholy is how I’d describe the thematic heart of AA and we’ve been incredibly happy to see how many people resonated with it.\n\n**It’s also no lie to say that Astral Ascent was the biggest step forward for us as developers in general, and we’re still incredibly thankful for the community support we received.**\n\nWe’ve also recently launched our next project, [Fallen Fates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276270/Fallen_Fates/), this time a fantasy RPG (instead of a roguelite) built in collaboration with our community through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernian-workshop/fallen-fates). We’ve learned a lot from our past games — Astral Ascent most of all — and want to take everything we love about them and carry it over into this new, even more ambitious project… which, truth be told, probably won’t be done before 2028 (tentatively speaking) just because of the sheer scope of the project.\n\nIn any case, that’s the short of it about us.\n\nIt’s been a long road since we first started making games together, and each one has changed the way we think about what we do. Astral Ascent especially left a mark on us, not just in how we design but in how we see the people playing our work. It reminds us why we do this in the first place, and that’s to make beautiful games people will take joy in playing.\n\n**We’re excited to chat with you all and answer any questions whatsoever!**   \n\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you all! :)",

I'm posting today because our team is absolutely floored by the community response during the Steam Next Fest, and we wanted to share this incredible milestone with you all.\n\nAs of this morning, our game, **Re:Night**, has climbed to the **#1 Top Demo spot** in the official \"Card Game\" category for the festival.\n\n**You can see the proof here:** [https://imgur.com/a/gPUM0jI](https://imgur.com/a/gPUM0jI)\n\nFor our tiny indie team, this is a legitimate dream come true.\n\nFor those seeing **Re:Night** for the first time, it's our passion project—a deep, single-player fusion of **roguelike deckbuilding** (think *Slay the Spire*) and **grid-based SRPG tactics** (think *Into the Breach*). It's all about commanding a 3-person squad, where positioning on the board is just as critical as the cards you play.\n\nThe full game is planned for Q4 2025, but the free demo that's currently topping the charts is available for everyone to play right now. We would be genuinely honored to get feedback from one of the most dedicated PC gaming communities on the internet.\n\nI'll be here all day to answer any questions you might have about the game, the development process, or this crazy Next Fest experience.\n\n**Key Links:**\n\n* **Play the Free Demo on Steam:** [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2372240/ReNight/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2372240/ReNight/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=pcgaming_number1_milestone)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8pdmfp9ubivf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c3e3a5c809aa34a4ea14114100c0ce00e841569",

    "selftext": "Announcement Post \n\nA dark comedy point-and-click murder mystery set in 1997 where every pixel is evidence, every action costs time, and every ending is twisted.\n\nIt’s 1997 in the small, suspicious town of Ravenvale Heights. A string of mysterious student deaths has the whole community on edge… and you, a weary, grizzled ex-detective, have been sent undercover as a “safety auditor” to figure out what’s really going on.\n\nSideEye High is a darkly comedic, mature-themed point-and-click adventure that combines the style of ‘90s classics with modern investigation mechanics. Inspect every hallway, locker, and gum-stained tile—because in this school, everything is evidence.\n\nFeatures:\n\nOne Main Mystery, Dozens of Detours – Solve the core case, or get sidetracked by over 50 false endings, each with its own twisted mini-mystery.\n\nNo Fail States – The week-long investigation ends no matter what, but your choices—and missed clues—shape the outcome.\n\nZoom Beyond the Surface – Get close enough to read notes, see tiny details, or even peek behind objects.\n\nEvery Pixel Matters – Nearly everything is searchable and interactable, down to screws in the wall and scuff marks on the floor.\n\nTime is Your Enemy – Every action costs time. Decide what’s worth investigating before the clock runs out.\n\nMature Dark Humor – 1990s satire that’s sharp, absurd, and occasionally uncomfortably real.\n\nSideEye High is for those who grew up loving adventure games and are ready for one that grew up with them.\n\nNew Demo now available!",

    "selftext": "Windows is very close to being great for gamepads. There are multiple third-party apps (like r/Playnite) that allow for a great gamepad experience in multiple aspects, however, typing is NOT one of them.\n\nA lot of games require typing, which prevents us from having a true couch gaming experience on PC, but there's an easy solution that only Microsoft can provide:\n\n**1 - Allow us to open the new on-screen keyboard (OSK), with gamepad support, that at the moment is reserved for tablets, by clicking or pressing A over text boxes, and through a gamepad button combo.**   \nThis would allow the OSK to be invoked by either simulating a mouse click with the gamepad (for older games), selecting text boxes with A (on modern games that eventually support this feature), or force-opening it with a gamepad combo for games that are particularly iffy with text boxes. This would effectively bypass the need to get out of the sofa and use a keyboard just to name your character in a new RPG, for example. \n\n**2 - Make sure the OSK, on gamepad mode, captures all gamepad inputs for itself, and does not allow these inputs to reach the game in the background.**  \nThis would prevent a big problem with the already existing Steam keyboard: if you're not playing the game with SteamInput enabled (for example, in games that already support Xbox gamepads), all the gamepad buttons being pressed while typing are also reaching the game, causing your character to walk, attack or do whatever actions correspond to the typing shortcuts, including leaving the text box in case of emulators. Capturing all inputs from the gamepad and only sending what is actually being typed (the keyboard keys) would prevent this, and massively increase compatibility with older games.\n\n**Bonus:** give us the fullscreen Windows experience for desktops, and allow it to use custom library managers (like Playnite). This would fix a lot of problems with window focus that can happen when launching games in borderless fullscreen and also make the experience more seamless. \n\nI believe these tweaks would greatly improve the gaming experience on Windows, bringing it much closer to an authentic Xbox experience.",

Each one has unique traits and drops items that can be used to craft decorations, furniture, and lures. Sometimes they get attacked by Ghosts who just want to spoil the fun.\n\nThe demo covers the first seven in-game days (around 1.5-2 hours of play). You can:\n\n* Attract and care for your first Critterlings\n* Decorate your farm and house with dozens of craftable items\n* Experiment with items that lure specific species\n* Meet the Townfolk and explore the beach\n\nIt’s colorful, weird, and hopefully very cozy.\n\n👉 **Play the demo here:** [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2497070/Cosmic\\_Coop/]()\n\nI’ll be hanging out in the comments to answer any questions about development, inspiration, or the design process.\n\nThanks for checking it out and for supporting small devs during Next Fest!",

Players will have unprecedented terraforming control, and will be able to \"own\" planets and interact in a galactic economy.\n\nKoster gives more details on the system in this longform chat, such as the limitations they had to place on moving fire and water, the methods of creation and sustainability they implemented to counteract the methods of destruction, and how different species of plants and animals evolve.\n\nIn developer circles he's also well known for writing A Theory of Fun, and there's a large section of the chat devoted to game design theory. At the time the book was written, \"are games art?\" was a hot topic, and 20 years later he's happy to revisit that and recount how gaming has progressed.",

    "selftext": "**Greetings, everyone!**\n\nOur upcoming project - a medieval RPG **Legacy of Valor** \\- is on Kickstarter, and we've already surpassed our first stretch goal.\n\nBut first, I'd like to introduce you to the game itself.\n\n**Legacy of Valor** is a medieval RPG that blends **castle building**, **territory management**, **large-scale battles**, and a **story-driven narrative** into one immersive experience. In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Husák! 😊), but soon, **thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his **passion, enthusiasm, and desire** are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Husák himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to **expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile – and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point, **we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that **Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*“Hey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors — If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you’re gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step — launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign — just like old times — and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let’s rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let’s build that castle from the ground up — together.”*\n\nWe can’t express how much this means to us. **Warhorse Studios inspired us** \\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives **Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let’s carry this legacy forward. **Together!**\n\nKickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit: [r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX: [https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website: [https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

    "selftext": "**Hey, r/pcgaming!**\n\n**I’m Louis Denizet, game director at** [Hibernian Workshop](https://hibernian-workshop.com/)**, the indie studio behind the roguelite** [Astral Ascent](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280930/Astral_Ascent/) **— and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have!**\n\nI started the studio years ago after meeting Alexandre Magnat online — we were both self-taught and completely obsessed with pixel art, especially the kind you see in anime across different eras and styles. \n\nWhat followed after a few years since this match was Astral Ascent, a colorful, fast-paced roguelite in the vein of Dead Cells with a focus on fluid combat, replayability (with 5 unique characters to choose from), and wrapped up in a pixel art style that’s by now become a signature of our work. \n\nIt wasn’t our first game, but it’s the one where we finally found our footing. A bright fantasy with an underlying melancholy is how I’d describe the thematic heart of AA and we’ve been incredibly happy to see how many people resonated with it.\n\n**It’s also no lie to say that Astral Ascent was the biggest step forward for us as developers in general, and we’re still incredibly thankful for the community support we received.**\n\nWe’ve also recently launched our next project, [Fallen Fates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276270/Fallen_Fates/), this time a fantasy RPG (instead of a roguelite) built in collaboration with our community through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernian-workshop/fallen-fates). We’ve learned a lot from our past games — Astral Ascent most of all — and want to take everything we love about them and carry it over into this new, even more ambitious project… which, truth be told, probably won’t be done before 2028 (tentatively speaking) just because of the sheer scope of the project.\n\nIn any case, that’s the short of it about us.\n\nIt’s been a long road since we first started making games together, and each one has changed the way we think about what we do. Astral Ascent especially left a mark on us, not just in how we design but in how we see the people playing our work. It reminds us why we do this in the first place, and that’s to make beautiful games people will take joy in playing.\n\n**We’re excited to chat with you all and answer any questions whatsoever!**   \n\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you all! :)",

    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nRaivk here, one of the two people working on ULTRA VERTIGO. We initially made this as a sequel to Liminascent, our previous first-person platformer, and renamed it because here in France \"Liminascent\" isn't easy to pronounce...\n\nWell, we had a ton of fun making the game as a side project (besides our boring main jobs), and we are excited to see people playing the demo. It's our first solo project on Steam, as we already released a game with a publisher, but now we want more freedom, hence the self-publishing. We'd be more than happy to get feedback on the game, see what you like, what you dislike so we can enhance it and hopefully make something great in the long run! We're aiming for a release by the end of the year, as most of the \"complete\" game is ready.\n\nThe demo here is just a part of the complete game, to get the feeling of it and see if it's for you. We will probably keep the demo up permanently, as we believe it's better to be able to try a game before buying it.\n\nThat's it! Hope you'll enjoy it. I'll be available to answer any questions you might have.\n\nHere is the link of the game if you want to play!  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA\\_VERTIGO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA_VERTIGO)",

    "title": "Sceptre B30  Curved Monitor Went Black — Could It Be the Power Adapter?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m having an issue with my Sceptre B30 100Hz curved monitor and trying to figure out if it’s the monitor itself or the power adapter. Here’s what happened:\n\nI run a 3-monitor setup:\n\nSceptre Curved 30\" 21:9 Gaming LED Monitor 2560x1080p UltraWide Ultra Slim HDMI\\\\DisplayPort Up to 100Hz  → GPU \n\nAcer 24 inch → GPU\n\nThinkVision 24 inch→ Motherboard (onboard GPU)\n\nLast night while playing Rust, one of my key inputs was acting stuck (likely a Razer Tartarus Pro/keybind issue). I restarted the PC, which installed updates.\n\nAfter the update, I noticed some graphical glitching on all my monitors (sometimes happens with outdated GPU drivers), so I updated my graphics drivers. Everything seemed fine at first.\n\nWhile playing Rust again (\\~15 minutes), my Sceptre monitor started flickering bad, going black on/off, and then went completely black. \n\nIt was showing inconsistent results each time I power cycled. Sometimes just black, sometimes something you could see, sometimes flickering and sometimes what looked like artifacts.\n\n Originally, the Sceptre logo would show on startup, but now it doesn’t appear at all, and the screen is always black. \n\nTroubleshooting steps I’ve tried:\n\nSwapping DisplayPort to the motherboard → no change\n\nPower cycling the monitor\n\nHolding the power button while unplugged\n\nLeaving it unplugged (monitor and PC) for 12 hours\n\nTrying HDMI and other ports\n\nOccasionally, when I power it on, it shows a single horizontal gray line (almost checkered) that slowly fades to black. When off, you can tell the monitor is getting some power because it’s brighter than completely dead. Windows display switching sometimes makes it flicker brighter which is odd.\n\nMy other monitors work fine — they don’t require high-power adapters. This Sceptre uses a 12V 4A adapter\n\nI’ve ordered a new power adapter, as I strongly suspect the original adapter is failing. How likely do you think it is that this issue is just the adapter vs an internal monitor failure?\n\n\n\n",

And would have thought the gpu was broken. \n\nDoing this with ddu might be the first instinct experienced pc builders like many people on this sub have. But the majority of people who are gaming on pc dont know shit about their machines. \n\n\nWe are both using a 7900xtx btw \n\nddu link:\nhttps://www.guru3d.com/download/display-driver-uninstaller-download/",

    "selftext": "I purchased the computer linked below, a skytech king 95, back in april, and only have recently been able to use it. I've never owned a PC before, and this is also my first time using one to play games. However, I keep having an issue where while I am playing something, the screen will randomly go black, then say \"no signal\", and then the computer will automatically boot back up again and I lose whatever I was doing. When that happens, the lights/fans on the pc stay going. The games where this has happened on was sims, simcity, and planet zoo (during this game it happens literally every 5-10 minutes).\n\nI tried to download rdr2 last night, and whenever i tried to open the game, nothing would come up, or the few times a box opened it immediately went to \"not responding\" before any part of the game even showed. I went to steam and it said it can't open it because it was playing in the background, so I went to my task manager to see if I can close it somehow or at least see if maybe one of these games is taking up too much space or something and that's why I'm having these issues, but then when I go to \"performance\" it immediately goes to \"not responding\". I went to Google to try to find an answer, and came to a conclusion it might have something to do with the power supply,but when I called a repair shop down the street they said it might be the graphics card.\n\nHow could I tell which one needs repair (this is a brand new computer) or if something else is the problem? Would I just have to take it in the repair shop, or should I look into the warranty and ship it back to be repaired/replaced with my protection plan? Is this something I can fix myself without having to do any of that? I would greatly appreciate any help, I am completely lost and understand basically nothing about computer parts\n\nSkytech King 95 Gaming PC Desktop AMD Ryzen 7 7700X AMD Radeon RX 7800XT 1TB Gen4 SSD 32GB RAM, AIO Liquid Cooling Windows 11\n\nhttps://www.walmart.com/ip/14034866056?sid=81c46165-dc76-45f2-ad5d-604ae458142f",

I’m running into this weird issue though. When I click “shut down” the computer shuts down like normal. Turns completely off, then about 2 seconds later, turns back on. No matter how many times I click shutdown it does it again. \n\nRegardless of what screen I click shutdown from, it happens. The only way I can actually turn the PC off is to hold the power button for 10 seconds or so and it shuts off. But that’s causing me reboot issues and the computer wants to go in recovery mode sometimes. \n\nI had this issue once on another PC a few years ago but after doing a windows update it fixed it. I tried that now and it’s still doing it. Any advice would be nice. ",

    "selftext": "Ya so iv been a little apple muncher for awhile because I never really wanted to deal with the hassle of putting a PC together with the literal thousands of options on parts but with newer games coming out that I want to play and xbox being xbox, I decided to finally build a computer. I already spent a couple weeks putting these parts together so I can have somewhat of a future proof pc for a couple of years and with the crap show that is prices nowadays iv been leaning more to the higher end stuff. \n\nhere's my parts list: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/vBfj6Q](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/vBfj6Q)\n\nNow I know I could get a B650 for the same price to performance but just for couple of bucks more gets me additional SSD slots and the added WIFI7 that I eventually plan to get fiber optic internet to take full advantage off. \n\nI could not for the life of me find any 4070 12GB GPUs that werent the same price of the current 5070 12GB so I decided to go with the 5070 12GB. \n\nI went with the 32GB of DDR5 ram because I plan to switch up all my functions that I did on my Mac to this computer that involves video editing, recording, recording gameplay, gaming, and the occasion streaming. \n\n  \nI couldn't decide between SSD's like the WD black or the 990 evo, the difference between the more reputable brands and the less commons ones where like 20$ especially with the 2TB SSD so I decided to go with the WD black. \n\nIm still figuring out the exact PSU wattage I need no less that a 750w would be needed but might just to a 850W just to be safe and the Bequite PSU's seem to have some of the best reviews (Im aiming for more off a quite PC but I plan to headphone game and have a shotgun microphone so a bit of noise should be to much to handle.)\n\nthe Ryzen 5 7600x is pretty much the only GPU I can afford that mid to high range and seemingly wouldn't bottle neck everything. \n\nIm getting the corsair case because it looks good (even though its a all black setup looks dont matter much) and plenty of space for any upgrade I want in the future, plus the other cases are like 20-30 bucks less so I just one a one and done case I can keep forever. \n\nIm adding in a corsair AIO 360mm CPU cooler so I can have a radiator blowing the hot air out and all I would need to do is buy 3 additional intake fans to get good airflow (Also corsair to keep it nice and clean) \n\nI dont know much about different operating systems still got to research this and pick one. I dont know even if there options (I can't look right now because im leaving for a party before typing this) So most likely the most basic. \n\nand I already have a basic Samsung odyssey G3 monitor with decent mouse and keyboard. So no money spent there. Maybe a second monitor but that's later. \n\nIv never built one before and really starting to get a bad ache with the companions of eveything but would really love someone experienced opinion on this. Maybe a few more searching and switching options but this looks to me like the build that's im planning on so honest opinions would be appreciated. Thanks y'all. ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been dealing with persistent micro-stuttering on my PC and I’m completely out of ideas. I’ve tried almost everything I can think of, and nothing has solved it so far. Just Hoping someone might have insight I could have missed. Here’s my setup and what I’ve tried:\n\n\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n* GPU: NVIDIA RTX 5070 (driver version 581.57)\n* Motherboard: MSI PRO B650M (BIOS 7D77v1O2)\n* RAM: 32 GB\n* Storage: Samsung 980 Pro NVMe + WD Black SN770 NVMe + 1 WD HDD\n* OS: Windows 11, build 22631\n\n**Symptoms:**\n\nVery short millisecond frame drops and micro-stutter in games and general GPU-heavy tasks.\n\nLatencyMon shows nvlddmkm.sys as the main problem, with spikes around 2.2 ms.\n\nHard pagefaults appear (\\~62k total), mostly from mbamservice.exe (Malwarebytes), but spikes persist even when it's disabled. Though, I did find any time I load up games the hardpage faults go up to 20 - 60 000 on one application alone.\n\n  \n**What I’ve tried so far:**\n\n1. Clean reinstall of NVIDIA drivers using DDU.\n2. PCIe Gen 3 / Gen 4 toggling in BIOS.\n3. HPET on/off.\n4. MPO on/off.\n5. Windows power mode: Maximum Performance.\n6. HAGS enabled/disabled.\n7. Disabling unused network adapters and NVIDIA HD audio.\n8. Updated motherboard BIOS, GPU VBIOS, and NVMe firmware.\n9. Moving NVMe drives to different M.2 slots.\n10. Disabling background apps, overlays, hardware acceleration in Discord/Chrome.\n11. AMD chipset drivers updated; old AM4 drivers cleaned.\n12. Checked Event Viewer, nothing clearly abnormal beyond occasional disk or GPU entries.\n13. Tried turning off C-states.\n\nI migrated my Windows install from AM4 → AM5 without doing a fresh install, and I admit is most likely the cause of my problem, but doing so will result in me losing everything on my computer which is extremly tedious to get back. Has anyone seen persistent nvlddmkm.sys micro-stutter like this after a motherboard/CPU upgrade?\n\n  \n**Latencymon:** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdevrrdiuyvf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=913c172c1160af02951b9dc17c49dca227d41990\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nYour system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks.

Whenever I put it to sleep for the night or shut it off completely, in the morning when I turn it on the lights will turn on and it starts to boot but then it shuts off and re-boots back up into the UEFI safe mode screen. When I get to that screen I hit F10, save and exit and then it boots up into windows fine. I’m able to play games, I monitor the cpu/gpu temps and everything seems completely normal. Although today it did crash once during gameplay with weird lines on the screen and the computer completely crashed. But I realized there was a new gpu driver update so I downloaded it and it hasn’t happened since. The computer is just having problems booting up. I brought it to Microcenter and they couldn’t re-create the problem and said everything was fine with my pc but it’s still doing the safe mode thing. \n\nSpecs: RTX5070/Ryzen 7 7800 X3D\n\nAnybody got any ideas what it could be? Or troubleshooting steps I can take to fix it?  \n\nI’m new to gaming pcs and this is my first rig so I have very little knowledge. \n\nThanks. ",

But after 2 weeks of use I was playing Battlefield 1 and out of nowhere it simply turned off and wouldnt reboot again. Turns out my GPU got a short circuit. I thought it was most likely the PSU as its a Gamemax one, which everyone advises not to buy. So I got a new PSU (MSI Mag) and got another GPU from RMA (same model). After that, it was a nice month and a half of no problems whatsover. Then last week I was playing BF1 (which I hadnt played in a while) and the same problem occurs again, PC turns off and wont boot. I had already figured it would be the GPU so I finally sent it to technical support for them to have a look. To my surprise, they said it could be the monitor thats causing the issue. I then did a little research and found a post on Reddit with the exact same issue as mine and also playing the same game as me (BF1). I then discovered the problem with the 20th pin of Display Port cables. Could this be the issue? Can it actually kill my GPU? Or is it the monitor? Even weirder is why all of this happens only with BF1? Does anyone know if its actually possible for the energy on the cable to fry the GPU? I am so scared to get a new GPU and the same thing happen again.\n\nPC specs:\n\nCPU: Ryzen 5 5600\n\nGPU: XFX SPEEDSTER SWFT 210 RX 7600 \n\nMobo: Pichau Danuri B550M-PX (Rebrand from Maxsun)\n\nPSU:  MSI MAG A650BN",

When I booted back into Windows two of my six drives - both data backups - are now encrypted! Can't access 3TB of data! It's asking for a key but I never set one up. Google only gives results if your boot drive is Bitlocked, not a D: or E: storage drive. I ran some data recovery software but it shows zero files to recover.\n\nHelp me Reddit. You're my only hope...  \n\\*bends down, places info into R2 unit\\*\n\nUPDATE:  \nI gave up using every damn data retrieval program I could download and nothing worked. I went to a lot of sketchy sites and downloaded torrents that I'm sure filled my PC with more spyware and viruses than I can count so I did a clean install of Win 11 to wipe it out and THE FUCKING BITLOCKER SCREEN CAME UP AGAIN!!! Luckily I do have the key for that. Shit is turning itself on automatically!

    "title": "HAVN BF 360: the marketing got to me",
    "selftext": "Coming from a Fractal Meshify 2 that was perfectly adequate but somewhat boring, and had some annoying quirks, I've been searching for a new case. For the last month or two I've probably looked at 100 different cases and debated a bunch of possible SFF/mATX builds for a while. Ultimately I wanted to focus on airflow and that coincided when HAVN started an intense advertising campaign for this case. \n\nI initially was less than impressed, I thought the front panel looked like [the material in airplane bathrooms](https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/53d9caf0dcd5888e1459e75f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/airplane-bathroom.jpg?mbid=social_retweet), and I figured the oversized fans were a gimmick. Ultimately the design grew on me and I decided to order the Flow version with included 180mm intake fans and a 140mm exhaust.\n\nI was coming from a 360 AIO that performed well but I wanted to go to an all air cooled setup. I figured the boat propeller sized fans would probably do a decent job of cooling even without an AIO.\n\nI'm definitely not an expert builder, with only 3 builds under my belt now. I ordered direct from HAVN and it arrived in under a week, shipping from California. Everything feels very premium and easy to work with, materials are attractive and weighty. The weight may be nice to some or an annoyance to others. I like the wight, it feels durable. I was trying to go for a high end case and I feel this hits the mark while being sleek and understated. \n\nBack panel cable management is nothing amazing but it works. The rubber gaskets look cool but are a bit finicky, they like to pop out of their housings in the case but seat right back in, just a little annoying. The magnets that hold the front panel on are very light. The removable side and top panels have very light retention but there are retaining screws that can be used. \n\nWhat was a major disappointment was the built in GPU anti sag device. It was awkward to use and I couldn't get it to work with the 5090. That may be more of a reflection on the size of the 5090 as there was not much room to work with. I ended up removing it altogether and using a cheap anti-sag bracket from amazon. \n\nI've only been able to game a bit since I built this but temps actually appear lower than they were with my 360 AIO. I'm assuming this has to do with the huge amount of airflow. Further testing is needed. I have two 180mm fans for the top ordered but I'm not really sure if I'll need them. \n\nOverall I'm happy with the case, mainly due to the good airflow and attractive appearance. I summarized my thoughts below.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nPros:\n\nGreat airflow, easy to work in, build quality is very nice, heavy and feels premium, fans are fairly quiet and have a low sound signature, silent at idle, attractive and understated, somewhat unique appearance due to front panel and top grates.\n\nCons:\n\nExpensive, heavy, fans move A LOT of air and are quiet but have a low drone some may find annoying, cable gasket system can be a bit finicky, GPU sag device seems subpar for larger cards, front panel kind of looks like bathroom material, panels snap in place with very light retention.\n\n  \nBuild list:\n\nCPU: 9800x3d\n\nCPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D15 chromax\n\nMobo: ASUS 870E-E\n\nRAM: Kingston Fury Beast 32GB 6000MT/s DDR5 CL30\n\nStorage: Samsung 990 PRO 2TB\n\nGPU: Astral 5090\n\nCase: HAVN BF360 Flow\n\nPSU: Corsair HX1500i",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m having an issue with my Sceptre B30 100Hz curved monitor and trying to figure out if it’s the monitor itself or the power adapter. Here’s what happened:\n\nI run a 3-monitor setup:\n\nSceptre Curved 30\" 21:9 Gaming LED Monitor 2560x1080p UltraWide Ultra Slim HDMI\\\\DisplayPort Up to 100Hz  → GPU \n\nAcer 24 inch → GPU\n\nThinkVision 24 inch→ Motherboard (onboard GPU)\n\nLast night while playing Rust, one of my key inputs was acting stuck (likely a Razer Tartarus Pro/keybind issue). I restarted the PC, which installed updates.\n\nAfter the update, I noticed some graphical glitching on all my monitors (sometimes happens with outdated GPU drivers), so I updated my graphics drivers. Everything seemed fine at first.\n\nWhile playing Rust again (\\~15 minutes), my Sceptre monitor started flickering bad, going black on/off, and then went completely black. \n\nIt was showing inconsistent results each time I power cycled. Sometimes just black, sometimes something you could see, sometimes flickering and sometimes what looked like artifacts.\n\n Originally, the Sceptre logo would show on startup, but now it doesn’t appear at all, and the screen is always black. \n\nTroubleshooting steps I’ve tried:\n\nSwapping DisplayPort to the motherboard → no change\n\nPower cycling the monitor\n\nHolding the power button while unplugged\n\nLeaving it unplugged (monitor and PC) for 12 hours\n\nTrying HDMI and other ports\n\nOccasionally, when I power it on, it shows a single horizontal gray line (almost checkered) that slowly fades to black. When off, you can tell the monitor is getting some power because it’s brighter than completely dead. Windows display switching sometimes makes it flicker brighter which is odd.\n\nMy other monitors work fine — they don’t require high-power adapters. This Sceptre uses a 12V 4A adapter\n\nI’ve ordered a new power adapter, as I strongly suspect the original adapter is failing. How likely do you think it is that this issue is just the adapter vs an internal monitor failure?\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "My PC was working fine but was getting laggy so I figured I'd reinstall Windows 11. I've NEVER turned on BitLocker - no need for it. When I booted back into Windows two of my six drives - both data backups - are now encrypted! Can't access 3TB of data! It's asking for a key but I never set one up. Google only gives results if your boot drive is Bitlocked, not a D: or E: storage drive. I ran some data recovery software but it shows zero files to recover.\n\nHelp me Reddit. You're my only hope...  \n\\*bends down, places info into R2 unit\\*\n\nUPDATE:  \nI gave up using every damn data retrieval program I could download and nothing worked. I went to a lot of sketchy sites and downloaded torrents that I'm sure filled my PC with more spyware and viruses than I can count so I did a clean install of Win 11 to wipe it out and THE FUCKING BITLOCKER SCREEN CAME UP AGAIN!!! Luckily I do have the key for that. Shit is turning itself on automatically! Was able to get back to Windows but the storage drives are still locked.\n\nIf it helps, I am running an AORUS B550 Elite AX v2, a Ryzen 7 5700X3D, 64GB ram, and a 12gb GeForce RTX 3060. Is there some damn glitch with that combo that LOVES to activate that effin' BitLocker?!\n\n  \nUPDATE #2:  \nI've given up, boys. Can't get into the no matter what I try. Thirty seconds ago I pressed the format button an nuked \\*years\\* of data. I have some backups but I think they're too old. \n\nUgh. Fuck Microsoft and this bullshit they forced on us.",

    "title": "HAVN BF 360: the marketing got to me",
    "selftext": "Coming from a Fractal Meshify 2 that was perfectly adequate but somewhat boring, and had some annoying quirks, I've been searching for a new case. For the last month or two I've probably looked at 100 different cases and debated a bunch of possible SFF/mATX builds for a while. Ultimately I wanted to focus on airflow and that coincided when HAVN started an intense advertising campaign for this case. \n\nI initially was less than impressed, I thought the front panel looked like [the material in airplane bathrooms](https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/53d9caf0dcd5888e1459e75f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/airplane-bathroom.jpg?mbid=social_retweet), and I figured the oversized fans were a gimmick. Ultimately the design grew on me and I decided to order the Flow version with included 180mm intake fans and a 140mm exhaust.\n\nI was coming from a 360 AIO that performed well but I wanted to go to an all air cooled setup. I figured the boat propeller sized fans would probably do a decent job of cooling even without an AIO.\n\nI'm definitely not an expert builder, with only 3 builds under my belt now. I ordered direct from HAVN and it arrived in under a week, shipping from California. Everything feels very premium and easy to work with, materials are attractive and weighty. The weight may be nice to some or an annoyance to others. I like the wight, it feels durable. I was trying to go for a high end case and I feel this hits the mark while being sleek and understated. \n\nBack panel cable management is nothing amazing but it works. The rubber gaskets look cool but are a bit finicky, they like to pop out of their housings in the case but seat right back in, just a little annoying. The magnets that hold the front panel on are very light. The removable side and top panels have very light retention but there are retaining screws that can be used. \n\nWhat was a major disappointment was the built in GPU anti sag device. It was awkward to use and I couldn't get it to work with the 5090. That may be more of a reflection on the size of the 5090 as there was not much room to work with. I ended up removing it altogether and using a cheap anti-sag bracket from amazon. \n\nI've only been able to game a bit since I built this but temps actually appear lower than they were with my 360 AIO. I'm assuming this has to do with the huge amount of airflow. Further testing is needed. I have two 180mm fans for the top ordered but I'm not really sure if I'll need them. \n\nOverall I'm happy with the case, mainly due to the good airflow and attractive appearance. I summarized my thoughts below.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nPros:\n\nGreat airflow, easy to work in, build quality is very nice, heavy and feels premium, fans are fairly quiet and have a low sound signature, silent at idle, attractive and understated, somewhat unique appearance due to front panel and top grates.\n\nCons:\n\nExpensive, heavy, fans move A LOT of air and are quiet but have a low drone some may find annoying, cable gasket system can be a bit finicky, GPU sag device seems subpar for larger cards, front panel kind of looks like bathroom material, panels snap in place with very light retention.\n\n  \nBuild list:\n\nCPU: 9800x3d\n\nCPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D15 chromax\n\nMobo: ASUS 870E-E\n\nRAM: Kingston Fury Beast 32GB 6000MT/s DDR5 CL30\n\nStorage: Samsung 990 PRO 2TB\n\nGPU: Astral 5090\n\nCase: HAVN BF360 Flow\n\nPSU: Corsair HX1500i",

Have basic Logitech pebble key 2 and a Logitech M550.\n\nI’ve got only one cable coming to the Mac which is my HP dock located under my desk (wish I could post more pictures)\n\nGot my DJ mixer up top as I love DJing but since I’m full time school I’ve really been off that and focused on school. Really like my setup I’ve only got one cable coming down which is my power cable and cable management is really clean. This also took me a bit as I was trying to figure out the best solution. My solution was using a server rack cable management module that’s aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you’d do!",

    "selftext": "**Please ignore the cables and mess, that is currently in progress to be fixed.**  \n  \nI’m trying to add a 4th display under my main monitor. All three of my current monitors are wall-mounted, so there’s about an 8.5-inch vertical gap between the desk and the bottom edge of the middle screen. I’d like to fill that space with a small monitor that can tilt upward toward me, something around 15 inches smaller or larger is fine if it fits nicely.\n\nI work two remote jobs. My main desktop runs my primary job, and my company laptop handles a second, lighter role where I mostly respond to messages and manage a small team. Both setups really benefit from having two screens. I plan to use a KVM switch to share my keyboard/mouse and possibly one or two monitors between the systems, but I’d like a dedicated screen underneath the middle monitor for quick multitasking.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Fits within an 8.5-inch gap under my center monitor\n* Can tilt upward (20–35° ideally)\n* Doesn’t need to be fancy — 1080p is fine\n* Ideally plug-and-play (HDMI or USB-C)\n* Clean look that blends well with my setup\n\nI’ve looked into stretch bar displays, which would look amazing, but most are expensive or complicated to set up. So I’m leaning toward a portable monitor as a practical option for now. I just want to see if anyone has found a budget-friendly tilted display that fits under a main monitor like this.",

I currently use a chair with a footrest and really enjoy stretching my legs out while working or gaming — but it’s frustrating having my feet hit the wall when I do so. I’d also love a setup that gives me enough space to write on paper without needing to move my keyboard out of the way. For reference, I am 6ft1 and my floor to hip distance is about 40in, so i assumed a 45” depth desk would satisfy this. I just cannot seem to find one .\n\nAn L-shaped desk seems ideal,as it would give me the flexibility and space I’m after. I do have a rather large 45” monitor, but I plan to mount it on a wall arm, so that should help with space management.\n\nI’m not opposed to building a desk myself, but I’d prefer to find something ready-made if possible. (Please excuse the mess by the way!)",

Have basic Logitech pebble key 2 and a Logitech M550.\n\nI’ve got only one cable coming to the Mac which is my HP dock located under my desk (wish I could post more pictures)\n\nGot my DJ mixer up top as I love DJing but since I’m full time school I’ve really been off that and focused on school. Really like my setup I’ve only got one cable coming down which is my power cable and cable management is really clean. This also took me a bit as I was trying to figure out the best solution. My solution was using a server rack cable management module that’s aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you’d do!",

Most people probably prefer what they’ve long been familiar with—what they can navigate effortlessly even with their eyes closed. Everything else might just be decoration.",

It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper. \n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I just about had it after about 10 keys with the problem. I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone but I am just about fed up with reliability issues and GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust that 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at odd locaiton. What other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

I messaged the moderator of the Geek Hack interest checked forums, and they have not replied yet. So I thought I would make this post here also.\n\nI've got the prototype complete. If you guys have any suggestions of where I should sell this or if anyone would like to partner with me, please let me know.\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**ANSI60**\n\nA 4mm keyboard plate with multiple layout support.\n\n**Supported Layouts**\n\n* Split Backspace\n* Split Right Shift\n* Stepped Caps Lock\n* 7u Spacebar\n\n[Supported Layouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YHOHfZDZJXJPjWIfWgxHSUXzf9Ksx9y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Aluminum\n* Polycarbonate (PC)\n\n**Compatibility**\n\n* **Mounting styles:** Tray Mount\n* **Form factor:** 60% ANSI\n\n**Supported PCBs**\n\n* Venom HE 60% PCB\n* GH60 and DZ60 variants\n* Wooting 60HE\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**Introduction / Vision**\n\nIntroducing the **ANSI60** — a 4mm keyboard plate crafted for enthusiasts seeking to push the boundaries of typing acoustics and feel.   \nAt nearly three times the thickness of a standard 1.5mm plate, the ANSI60 transforms vibrational behavior, producing a crisper, more rounded tone with a fuller frequency response across the sound spectrum.\n\nMore than just thicker — the ANSI60 delivers a distinct typing experience unlike standard 1.5mm plates. With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested.

    "title": "HMX Firecracker has tickled a weird part of my brain and I may never recover: a review.",
    "selftext": "First and foremost - I'm a tactile switch lover through and through. I've tried a fair number this year, the most recent being the Sillyworks x Gateron Type R. I've tried both more budget options (I see you Akko V3 Cream Blue Pro!) and more premium offerings like the Drop x Invyr Holy Pandas. I've spent too much money but honestly I no longer care because I may have found IT. The one. Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

    "selftext": "Stopped by Free Greek Twin Cities today and saw this beauty for $1.  Grabbed it immediately.  I like checking out their stuff as they sometimes have some interesting things.  Not usually a place to go for cheap vintage things as they generally know what's good and price accordingly.  For instance this was right next to a Model M keyboard for $150 which I felt was a little over priced.  Now obviously this will take some work to make it usable.  There are broken rivets so it will need a bolt mod in addition to building a case of some sorts and something to connect to the membrane cables to wire up to a controller.  But the keycaps are very cool and split a spacebar... heck yeah.  For now, it'll sit in the collection as I have a long list of projects to work on.  But someday, this thing will rock again.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! Calvin with Clackify here.\n\nI'm happy to announce I've officially listed Clackify keyboard stands on my store!\n\nA few features:\n\nHolds 5 Keyboards:\nDisplays 4 keyboards on shelves with an additional keyboard slot in the middle for a 5th. I like hiding a fun 60% build in the 5th slot personally :)\n\nKeyboard Protection:\nStands are stable, support 15 lbs per shelf and have been thoroughly strength tested. Cork pads and silicone bumpers are built into each shelf to ensure boards are fully protected and prevent slippage. The bottom of the stand is also equipped with silicone pads to ensure the stand itself doesn't slide around.\n\nUSB Dongle/Flash Drive Storage:\nOffers USB dongle storage for storing and keeping track of wireless dongles as well as flash drives (28 slots total). Note these are not powered or connected, they are purely for storage. No more mixing up or losing your wireless dongles!\n\nPegboard Slots:\nThe back of the stand is equipped with skadis slots for various purposes. The stands are compatible with a variety of skadis accessories and hooks. There are also two slots on each side of the stand for a side hook/accessory. Be on the lookout for skadis accessories to start showing up on the Clackify store as well!\n\n14 Color Options:\nThere are a variety of color options ranging from simple colors to translucent and even Galaxy (sort of metallic) options.\n\nCustomizations:\nIf you'd like to have anything customized, don't hesitate to reach out! Other colors would be possible, and design tweaks could potentially be made for a small fee. Adding logos is also a possibility.\n\nFree US Shipping:\nKeyboard Stands (and any orders over $75 for that matter) ship free to locations in the US.\n\nMore information and photos can be found here: https://clackify.com/products/clackify-keyboard-stand-4-tier\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!

It’s kinda misses that “premium” feeling that they trying to make;\n\n2) QC should be better, because I have two not properly cut seats for switches in foam;\n\n3) Extra options for gasket mount with those small silicone things;\n\n4) Glued(?) to the back of pcb foam for sound dumping. It would be nicer if I could easily remove it;\n\nSoo… In the end I’m not disappointed but, at the same time I think they didn’t deliver to the level which you expect from €140 product.

    "selftext": "I have built/modded several premium boards, but regardless of that fact,  I picked up a used Ducky One Mini. I had seen a video by Alex Otos, praising his 60% Ducky budget keyboard. He said it was his go-to for gaming. Therefore I decided to pick one up and guess what? I love it. I can’t really explain it, but it just feels good to type on. It has a quiet sound profile (which I typically hate), and has a pretty minimalist vibe to it.\n\nWhen I first bought it (used off of eBay), I immediately regretted it because I felt I overpaid for it after I foolishly looked around and found some for half the price. As soon as I got it, I tried to swap out keycaps and those freakin’ inductive switches came out with every single keycap! I soon realized the used budget keycap set I had grabbed (off of eBay, as well) were way too tight. I had to fight every single switch to get it out of the keycap I had pulled off (when I decided I didn’t like them and chose to go back to the original keycaps). They were so hard to detach from the keycaps, my hands were killing me. I finally resorted to a rubber jar gripper that made the job a little easier as I got down to the last few keycaps.\n\nThe inductive switches came out crazy easy and I was not happy about that. However, when I got it back together again and just chose a few colorful keycaps for some modifier keys, I liked the simple look of it (and I will never again swap out the keycaps!) My hands literally ached the entire next day. \n\nHowever, after using it for a few days, I was hooked!  You have got feel it to understand it.\n\nLayout: 60%\nConnectivity: Tri-mode\nCase: ABS\nMount Style: Gasket-mount\nPlate material: SPCC Steel\nSwitches: Ducky Inductive Switches-linear, 3.5 mm total travel, 40g initial force\nDampening Design: Ducky QUACK Mechanics+ with 7-layer dampening\nKeycaps: Ducky 85% high-purity PBT Double-shot PBT\nStabalizers: Ducky Plate-Mounted\nHot-Swappable: Yes\nReport Rate: 1000 Hz\nSoftware: Web-based \nModifier Keycaps - Double-shot PBT (Ali Express)\n\n",

And I love it! I got all parts and built it nearly two days ago.\n\nI had no experience on mechanical keyboards (unless we count typing some Red Dragon keyboard I found in some store for one second), so I was gambling how the switches should behave. And I really like what I chose... I don't want to say I hit the jackpot yet, still a very new keyboard.\n\nThe keycaps have an uneven height... You can see on the function keys on the middle. But so far, not an actual issue when using my keyboard. And they're like soft on the touch, I really like that. I really liked the look of the MOA profile, and I think they're comfortable in general, especially when playing Tetris - my fingers sit on them seemingly flawlessly.\n\nNot on the sound test video but basically the numpad has a clacky sound in addition. Not (very) loud, especially how I'll almost only use it on Blender, pressing one specific key before I move back to the other keyboard or my mouse.\n\nInserting the keycaps on slot with stabalizers... For the stubborn ones (the enter key being the worst offender) - and I'll admit I don't know if it even actually worked or I was just lucky (I was past at my sleep schedule at that point lmao), I was raising and centering the cross thingies, then have the respective keyboard upside down with my hand (or arm, 1kg keyboard lmao), and insert they keycap in. I had to do all that process more than once with a couple of keycaps, but I did manage to make sure the stabalizers actually do their job.\n\nI have two PCs (a tower, and a tiny Single Board Computer), so the wireless features on both keyboards are reeeeally comfortable for me. I don't mind the keyboard's weight when I have to take out my graphics tablet, my desk is big enough to move around everything I need.",

Its based around an ESP32 CYD display, with a rotary encoder knob). Ideally I don't want to print up a board for this, and would really just like to have flying leads to my IO breakout. \n\nI'm really struggling to get leads to stick to the pins without them oxidising, melting... If it were a few switches I could just about do it, but getting 12 to stick is becoming challenging, and I fear for the longevity of it.\n\nChatGPT seemed to suggest there were keyswitches available with flying leads in place, but I have a strong suspicion its hallucinating given I can't find a single one. Getting a PCB printed is going to be expensive (and I'm already into the too much time / money sunk on random bits stage).\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas or experience in how to reliably connect to the switches? I was hoping I could crimp Dupont style connectors to them, but it seems risky (large moment of force on the thin legs) and theres not much vertical space.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4djk5f1j7avf1.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=d690575f4cfb23c6db93e1b3879d37c69b689d97\n\n  \n",

It works again.  \n\\- brought it home, the thing works well... until it goes into sleep mode.  \n\\- after waking up from sleep mode, nothing works. Have to open the whole thing and close it.... and it works  again... until it falls asleep.\n\nIdk how to convince this retailer to swap me a new one. They keep trying to fix it. I don't think they have a refund policy. I'm so tired of this piece of modern technology. I have brought it to the shop 5 times and there's going to be a 6th for this new sleep issue. And maybe on the 2nd month it will invent itself another issue\n\nImo it is the best sounding paperweight I have had, not a functioning keyboard though",

    "title": "4x10 Ortho Handwire",
    "selftext": "It’s so little!\n\nIn my ongoing quest to have all the orthos, I present my 4x10 entry. \n\nI had always been leery of qaz layouts, while I am comfortable working with layers going from 12 to 10 columns and dropping most of the modifiers into layers just seemed like a bridge too far. But, it is a logical step from planckland, so I decided to dig into it. \n\nSurprisingly, what I discovered when planning keymaps is that I really don’t need that many modifiers for normal typing, and the ones I need most fit along the bottom row just fine, making the layered modifiers really more of a matter of tucking away things I don’t use a lot anyway. That said, this is the first layout I have done with two essential layers - usually I can get the rest of the keys onto a single layer when laying out a 40, but this one does need an up and a down.\n\nIt’s not daily driver material, but it’s a nice change of pace keyboard and it has a singular spot in my collection.\n\nAlso, it’s the first linear switch keyboard I’ve made since the first mechanical keyboard I ever had. I had some magic girl switches I had bought thinking they were tactiles like my magic girl darks, but buyer beware. I figured I would use them eventually. They’re a little scratchy but they are a good weight. Also the housing color was a really good fit for the rest of the build, which counts for more than I like to admit on my visible handwires.\n\nAnyway, the case is printed parts from an open source design I found on github called the banime. I was inspired to do this build by the acai, but I didn’t find any case files for it directly and this was my favorite alternative design. The little mcu cutout is a handy bit when trying to squeeze in all those wires. I sent the body away to be resin printed in china. These cost a lot now but they’re still 1/3 to 1/4 of getting the same material domestically. Still, I can’t go buying too many, my next couple of projects are stacked acryllic cases I can get locally. \n\nMcu is a helios, the best rp2040 mcu for the money. The cheap ones are tempting, but only the helios and the wisdpi tiny seem to be consistently free from annoying quirks and defects in the pro micro form factor rp2040 world - I usually use rp2040 because I have a lot of working code to riff on and because I like their bootloader method the most.\n\nCaps are drop mt3 fairlanes. I didn’t love these in person as much as I did online. The legend contrast on the alphas is annoyingly low, but this seems to be the build that they finally gelled with. \n\nWiring is vanilla, no weird science this time out. The layout is this one’s trick.\n\nMy next ortho on the desk will probably be a 4x13 I found recently that’s squeezed into a 12.75 wide minivan case. I am running out of new layouts until I learn to do the CAD to make my own cases - at which point I’m doing the 6x10 ortho you didn’t know you needed.",

Despite the myriad of available options through GMK and others its frankly exhausting to find a set you like only to find out theres no chance you're getting the novelties, or the inverted dark version etc. Used market is hit or miss, and frankly i'd prefer to shine my own :D\n\nDesign- I plan to customize the ESC key to be the \"DSC OFF\" symbol- Enter will be the M logo, and SHIFT im thinking DCT pattern on right and Manual shift pattern on left shift. These will be installed on a keycult 1/1800 so the f rows text will line up better with the alphas colorway.\n\n  \nSo, whats the deal with Maxkey? It looks like they used to do a TON of group buys and colorways, then that all seems to have stopped? It even appears maxkey was the original purveyors of some popular styles (such as LIME?) or were they just cranking out clones during this period of high activity?\n\nAnyways for $50 + some customized logo keys and I should be well under $100 all said and done.

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI have posted this to Geek Hack also, but it's been over a week and my post has not been approved. I messaged the moderator of the Geek Hack interest checked forums, and they have not replied yet. So I thought I would make this post here also.\n\nI've got the prototype complete. If you guys have any suggestions of where I should sell this or if anyone would like to partner with me, please let me know.\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**ANSI60**\n\nA 4mm keyboard plate with multiple layout support.\n\n**Supported Layouts**\n\n* Split Backspace\n* Split Right Shift\n* Stepped Caps Lock\n* 7u Spacebar\n\n[Supported Layouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YHOHfZDZJXJPjWIfWgxHSUXzf9Ksx9y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Aluminum\n* Polycarbonate (PC)\n\n**Compatibility**\n\n* **Mounting styles:** Tray Mount\n* **Form factor:** 60% ANSI\n\n**Supported PCBs**\n\n* Venom HE 60% PCB\n* GH60 and DZ60 variants\n* Wooting 60HE\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**Introduction / Vision**\n\nIntroducing the **ANSI60** — a 4mm keyboard plate crafted for enthusiasts seeking to push the boundaries of typing acoustics and feel.   \nAt nearly three times the thickness of a standard 1.5mm plate, the ANSI60 transforms vibrational behavior, producing a crisper, more rounded tone with a fuller frequency response across the sound spectrum.\n\nMore than just thicker — the ANSI60 delivers a distinct typing experience unlike standard 1.5mm plates. With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested. We’re ready to place a bulk order and are gauging demand to lock quantities, materials, and colors.\n\nIf you’re interested—and open to a small preorder discount—please:  \n• Fill the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA)  \n• Join the [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/74VFKHyb)  \n• Or comment below\n\n**Discord to follow updates:** [Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/74VFKHyb)  \n**IC Form:** [Fill out the IC form](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA)\n\n[Full Album of Pictures and Videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EHXKIb6Zt4SlKxnAtUhdXVVJU-BShbJT?usp=sharing)",

I've tried both more budget options (I see you Akko V3 Cream Blue Pro!) and more premium offerings like the Drop x Invyr Holy Pandas. I've spent too much money but honestly I no longer care because I may have found IT. The one. Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

Calvin with Clackify here.\n\nI'm happy to announce I've officially listed Clackify keyboard stands on my store!\n\nA few features:\n\nHolds 5 Keyboards:\nDisplays 4 keyboards on shelves with an additional keyboard slot in the middle for a 5th. I like hiding a fun 60% build in the 5th slot personally :)\n\nKeyboard Protection:\nStands are stable, support 15 lbs per shelf and have been thoroughly strength tested. Cork pads and silicone bumpers are built into each shelf to ensure boards are fully protected and prevent slippage. The bottom of the stand is also equipped with silicone pads to ensure the stand itself doesn't slide around.\n\nUSB Dongle/Flash Drive Storage:\nOffers USB dongle storage for storing and keeping track of wireless dongles as well as flash drives (28 slots total). Note these are not powered or connected, they are purely for storage. No more mixing up or losing your wireless dongles!\n\nPegboard Slots:\nThe back of the stand is equipped with skadis slots for various purposes. The stands are compatible with a variety of skadis accessories and hooks. There are also two slots on each side of the stand for a side hook/accessory. Be on the lookout for skadis accessories to start showing up on the Clackify store as well!\n\n14 Color Options:\nThere are a variety of color options ranging from simple colors to translucent and even Galaxy (sort of metallic) options.\n\nCustomizations:\nIf you'd like to have anything customized, don't hesitate to reach out! Other colors would be possible, and design tweaks could potentially be made for a small fee. Adding logos is also a possibility.\n\nFree US Shipping:\nKeyboard Stands (and any orders over $75 for that matter) ship free to locations in the US.\n\nMore information and photos can be found here: https://clackify.com/products/clackify-keyboard-stand-4-tier\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!

    "selftext": "My experiences:\n\n**Corsair K95 (gone)**\n\nThe prints on that are laser imprinted and quickly faded. it became glossy and looked dirty after some use. It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper. \n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I just about had it after about 10 keys with the problem. I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone but I am just about fed up with reliability issues and GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust that 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at odd locaiton. What other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

Not usually a place to go for cheap vintage things as they generally know what's good and price accordingly.  For instance this was right next to a Model M keyboard for $150 which I felt was a little over priced.  Now obviously this will take some work to make it usable.  There are broken rivets so it will need a bolt mod in addition to building a case of some sorts and something to connect to the membrane cables to wire up to a controller.  But the keycaps are very cool and split a spacebar... heck yeah.  For now, it'll sit in the collection as I have a long list of projects to work on.  But someday, this thing will rock again.",

    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI have posted this to Geek Hack also, but it's been over a week and my post has not been approved. I messaged the moderator of the Geek Hack interest checked forums, and they have not replied yet. So I thought I would make this post here also.\n\nI've got the prototype complete. If you guys have any suggestions of where I should sell this or if anyone would like to partner with me, please let me know.\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**ANSI60**\n\nA 4mm keyboard plate with multiple layout support.\n\n**Supported Layouts**\n\n* Split Backspace\n* Split Right Shift\n* Stepped Caps Lock\n* 7u Spacebar\n\n[Supported Layouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YHOHfZDZJXJPjWIfWgxHSUXzf9Ksx9y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Aluminum\n* Polycarbonate (PC)\n\n**Compatibility**\n\n* **Mounting styles:** Tray Mount\n* **Form factor:** 60% ANSI\n\n**Supported PCBs**\n\n* Venom HE 60% PCB\n* GH60 and DZ60 variants\n* Wooting 60HE\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**Introduction / Vision**\n\nIntroducing the **ANSI60** — a 4mm keyboard plate crafted for enthusiasts seeking to push the boundaries of typing acoustics and feel.   \nAt nearly three times the thickness of a standard 1.5mm plate, the ANSI60 transforms vibrational behavior, producing a crisper, more rounded tone with a fuller frequency response across the sound spectrum.\n\nMore than just thicker — the ANSI60 delivers a distinct typing experience unlike standard 1.5mm plates. With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested. We’re ready to place a bulk order and are gauging demand to lock quantities, materials, and colors.\n\nIf you’re interested—and open to a small preorder discount—please:  \n• Fill the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA)  \n• Join the [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/74VFKHyb)  \n• Or comment below\n\n**Discord to follow updates:** [Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/74VFKHyb)  \n**IC Form:** [Fill out the IC form](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA)\n\n[Full Album of Pictures and Videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EHXKIb6Zt4SlKxnAtUhdXVVJU-BShbJT?usp=sharing)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently moved to a new place for a new job and I’m still setting up my apartment. One of the first things I want to get is a monitor that can work well for both productivity and gaming.\n\nHere’s my setup and what I’m looking for:\n\n* I have two laptops:\n   * A Legion 5 Pro (2021) gaming laptop (slightly old, but I mostly play FIFA on it; runs fine on low settings).\n   * A work laptop that I’ll use 8-9 hours a day for coding, documentation, and meetings.\n* I want a monitor that I can easily switch between both laptops (for example, one on HDMI, one on USB-C or DisplayPort).\n* I also plan to buy a PS5 soon, so I’d love a monitor that would be great for consoles too.\n\nI’m looking for something in the 27\"-32\" range. I’ll mostly use it for work during the day and for gaming/content (movies, YouTube, etc.) after hours.\n\nI was eyeing some OLED models but I’m a bit concerned about burn-in since the monitor will be on for long workdays. If OLED isn’t ideal for my use case, I’m open to high-quality IPS or VA panels too.\n\n**Budget:** Having a hard deciding this. On one hand, I do not want to spend much but on the other, I feel like it's a one-time investment for a long time and it does boost productivity too. Also, having experienced some high-end QLED TVs before, I am not easily impressed by displays.\n\nWould love recommendations or personal experiences with monitors that fit this mix of work + gaming + console use.\n\n**TL;DR: my main questions:**\n\n1. What panel type should I go for (OLED vs IPS vs VA)?\n2. Do OLED panels still have noticeable burn-in risk in 2025 for all-day work use?\n3. What resolution makes the most sense, is 4K worth it, or is QHD good enough?\n4. If I had to trade off quality to save money, is it better to go for QHD on a better panel or 4K on a worse one?\n5. Should I consider a dual-monitor setup, one for gaming/content and a cheaper one for static work tasks?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

    "selftext": "I have this QNIX QX2710 27\" IPS in 1440p that I've been using for a few years that a friend gave me when he upgraded. Honestly it's been a great monitor for my older rig but I'm looking to build a new PC soon and the donor RTX 3080 I'll be using until I get something else won't work with the Dual-Link DVI on this monitor. I've spent the last month or two looking around at all the newer monitors and I'm having a difficult time finding something I like and want to spend my money on. I'm not ready to spend $500+ on an OLED just yet, but I likely will within the next year when something nice catches my eye. Basically, I'm treating this current \"upgrade\" as my eventual second monitor, even though it will be my current main monitor. I have an old 24\" BenQ 1080p monitor I currently use as my secondary and I'll probably continue to use in vertical config once I have 3 monitors.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of video content, but I also do a good bit of other general task work, so I'm hesitant to get a VA monitor because once I get an OLED that will handle all the game/video content that requires the high contrast and refresh rates. I'd rather have an IPS for now since gaming has been fine on the QNIX (I don't play anything super competitive) and I don't want to deal with bad viewing angles or weird flicker. It seems like none of the last few years of IPS have gloss panels though, which is unfortunate because I really love how it looks on the QNIX.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions on a 27\" 1440p IPS and least 100/120hz for under $300? Ideally I don't want to spend over $200, and in the perfect world I'd love to find something for $100. How far back in time do I have to go to find a 2k IPS with a gloss screen that has HDMI or DP? I don't really care about HDR on this as it seems like the majority of IPS have bad implementation of it, and I can wait until an OLED for that anyways. It should also be VESA compatible so I can ditch the stand and put it on an arm, so I don't care if the stand is junk either.\n\nHopefully someone else has gone through this recently and can offer some suggestions. I feel like I'm in monitor hell digging through hundreds of reviews and threads trying to find what I want. I'm \\*this\\* close to just buying a cheap HDMI-DVI converter and living with 1440p@60hz until I get an OLED.",

I'm primarily looking at text for document editing/review, email, video calls, etc. I'm upgrading from a 27\" 1080p screen, which is horribly grainy.\n\nI'm looking to get two 4k monitors and am currently between Dell's S2725QS (240USD) and U2725QE (630USD) models. The advantages of the QE appear to be a somewhat nicer picture, better build quality, and an internal hub, whereas the QS has no hub features at all. My gut says to get two of the much cheaper QS and connect everything with an external hub. However, I don't know how to assess if the difference in picture quality justifies the price difference of almost $400/screen. I'm very picky about picture quality and could afford the QE, but I don't want to drop the money for a marginal gain in how nice my word documents look. I could get one of each to take advantage of the hub in one, but I worry having two slightly different monitors next to one another would be distracting.\n\nAnyone have experience with these screens and can say whether the difference in quality is noticeable? Is having the hub inside the screen vs. in an external peripheral preferable? Or is there another monitor entirely I should be considering?",

I mostly code on the laptop, so I don’t necessarily want a gaming monitor (I game very rarely). I’m currently coming from a 24″ Full HD (1920×1080), 75 Hz ASUS monitor, and because my laptop has a 120 Hz screen I feel the difference — and I want an upgrade.  \nThe thing that frustrates me the most is **stutter** on the laptop’s screen (when the external monitor is connected), which I assume comes from the difference in refresh rate between the external monitor and the laptop screen. I thought about getting a monitor also at 120 Hz (same as the laptop), but I’ve heard many bad opinions about those monitors, so I’m open to any recommendation.  \nMy **only requirements** are:\n\n1. The monitor must be **at least 120 Hz**.\n2. The budget is up to **300 euros**. My main deal-breaker is the stutter. I really want to get rid of it.

I love how the picture quality is on both but I also have to use this monitor for work. I currently spend anywhere from 6-10 hours working in various programs side-by-side with lots of static images. On the nights that I game after work, that’ll be a few more hours with static HUDs etc. \n\nThat makes me a little hesitant to get a OLED screen even though both manufacturers have built in screen protection. I’ve heard and seen in reviews that OLED burn-in is still a very real issue. \n\nAre there any other monitors with a high refresh rate but better quality than what I have now? \n\nShould I get an OLED monitor and risk burn in?\n\nI’d prefer to stay with a 32 inch but go to a non-curved if I can. I’d also like to stay with 1440p but if 4K gaming on the 5090 is better than gaming at 1440p, I’ll make that jump. \n\nTIA!",

    "selftext": "First off, thanks to anyone who takes the time to read and reply. \n\nI have a 14” MacBook Pro docked via a Caldigit TS3+ dock that I will likely upgrade to a TS4 soon. It’s docked closed; I will never use the MacBook screen at the same time as the monitor.\n\nMy current monitor is a Dell 24” 1080p.\n\nI have set my budget for roughly $500.\n\nI am pushing 50 and my eyesight isn’t quite what it once was!\n\nI do not need to buy today, but would like to pick something up by around the end of the year at the latest.\n\nThis monitor will be used 85% for productivity work (mostly office/web stuff but also some photo editing via Lightroom) and 15% for gaming. Most gaming on it will be via a PS5 (although I did just pick up Hades 2 for my MacBook).\n\nAlso of note: the majority of my gaming time is on my regular OLED TV via an xBox. Due to room layout and my kids, it’s not feasible to move the PS5 to my main TV. \n\nMy eyes will be between 20”-28” away from the screen, depending on if I am relaxing or working. I do have room to set the monitor a little further back if needed, though.\n\nFrom what I have read, OLED is likely out as I don’t want to worry about burn-in. As such, I am trying to decide between a 27” and 32” 4k screen, but leaning towards a 27\". While I can make it fit, a 32” would probably be overwhelming for the space. But if it would be the better choice, I will consider it and can increase my budget some. \n\nFrom my research, it seems like many people are happy with the scaling and clarity of using their MacBook with a 4k screen running in 1080p x 2 scaling for productivity work. Do folks in here agree? \n\nSo, with what I have said, what should I be looking at? I know there seems to multiple mini-LED IPS monitors recently released or coming out soon. Should I focus on one of those? Or is there something else that I should consider?",

Of course the money is the key so don't want to spend that much money for 4K OLED panel. And for that both cases money are mostly same. I know with 4090 not all new AAA games runs 4K RT on full details native. I also like to play native without Dlss (maybe quality if game is a hardcore RT like Indiana Jones) Mostly I play single players games so around 60-80 fps is ok for me. You think 1440p OLED quality will compensate 4K high quality mini led? I know OLED is OLED but maybe that new Mini Leds will be worth to wait and buy. ",

    "selftext": "Just upgraded to the MSI MAG 321UP QD-OLED and wanted to share my honest thoughts. This is the first OLED monitor I’ve owned and I use it mostly for gaming and movie nights. The image quality is stunning—the colors are super vibrant and the blacks are really deep. 4K resolution at 240Hz makes games look sharp and feel incredibly smooth (I paired it with a new graphics card, so no issues with frame rates). Setup was hassle-free and the menu is easy to use for tweaking modes. Haven’t noticed any burn-in after a week of heavy use, but I’ll update if things change. The monitor also handles bright room lighting well and has plenty of connectivity. If you’re moving from a regular IPS or VA, this upgrade is absolutely worth it! Happy to answer questions about my setup or display settings!",

    "selftext": "Hey guys,  \nSo I recently bought an **MSI G272QPF E2 (1440p / 180Hz / Rapid IPS)** for **$165**, kind of by accident. Originally, I was planning to get a **1080p 200–240Hz** monitor for aim training games like **KovaaK, BF6, Delta Force**, and **CS2**.\n\n**My PC specs:**\n\n* RTX 5070\n* Ryzen 7 7800X3D\n* iiyama 24\" 1080p 100Hz IPS (1 year old)\n* AOC 32\" 1440p 75Hz VA (4 years old)\n\nThe plan was to replace the iiyama with something faster, but I ended up buying a bigger monitor instead. I also wanted to have two separate monitors - one for single-player games.\n\nI’ve been looking for the *perfect monitor* \\- something with **great motion clarity, sharp image**. Basically, that “sweet spot” between speed and image quality. I’ve heard that 27\" 1440p 180hz is the ideal balance for that, but I got carried away when I saw this model heavily discounted.\n\nIdeally, I’d want a **24\" 1080p 200Hz** for competitive games and a **27–32\" VA 100Hz** with great colors for immersion.\n\nNow I’m not even sure if my system can push 180Hz at 1440p without frame gen. The return fee is about **$30–40**, but since it hasn’t shipped yet, I can still return it for free.\n\nIt also sucks that playing at 1080p on a 1440p screen looks bad.  \nWhat do you think? Should I keep the MSI?",

First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters. [P2712V Link](https://bit.ly/4gmDFse)\n\n**P275MV Plus (Mini-LED with DyDs)**\n\n* Same **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** dual mode\n* **Mini-LED FALD (1152 zones), HDR1000**\n* **What is DyDs**: the backlight is driven in sync with the panel update to keep motion clean **with local dimming on** and to improve visibility in dark scenes (less smearing/black crush than typical FALD IPS). [P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently moved to a new place for a new job and I’m still setting up my apartment. One of the first things I want to get is a monitor that can work well for both productivity and gaming.\n\nHere’s my setup and what I’m looking for:\n\n* I have two laptops:\n   * A Legion 5 Pro (2021) gaming laptop (slightly old, but I mostly play FIFA on it; runs fine on low settings).\n   * A work laptop that I’ll use 8-9 hours a day for coding, documentation, and meetings.\n* I want a monitor that I can easily switch between both laptops (for example, one on HDMI, one on USB-C or DisplayPort).\n* I also plan to buy a PS5 soon, so I’d love a monitor that would be great for consoles too.\n\nI’m looking for something in the 27\"-32\" range. I’ll mostly use it for work during the day and for gaming/content (movies, YouTube, etc.) after hours.\n\nI was eyeing some OLED models but I’m a bit concerned about burn-in since the monitor will be on for long workdays. If OLED isn’t ideal for my use case, I’m open to high-quality IPS or VA panels too.\n\n**Budget:** Having a hard deciding this. On one hand, I do not want to spend much but on the other, I feel like it's a one-time investment for a long time and it does boost productivity too. Also, having experienced some high-end QLED TVs before, I am not easily impressed by displays.\n\nWould love recommendations or personal experiences with monitors that fit this mix of work + gaming + console use.\n\n**TL;DR: my main questions:**\n\n1. What panel type should I go for (OLED vs IPS vs VA)?\n2. Do OLED panels still have noticeable burn-in risk in 2025 for all-day work use?\n3. What resolution makes the most sense, is 4K worth it, or is QHD good enough?\n4. If I had to trade off quality to save money, is it better to go for QHD on a better panel or 4K on a worse one?\n5. Should I consider a dual-monitor setup, one for gaming/content and a cheaper one for static work tasks?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

Of course the money is the key so don't want to spend that much money for 4K OLED panel. And for that both cases money are mostly same.

I also like to play native without Dlss (maybe quality if game is a hardcore RT like Indiana Jones) Mostly I play single players games so around 60-80 fps is ok for me.

    "selftext": "I have this QNIX QX2710 27\" IPS in 1440p that I've been using for a few years that a friend gave me when he upgraded. Honestly it's been a great monitor for my older rig but I'm looking to build a new PC soon and the donor RTX 3080 I'll be using until I get something else won't work with the Dual-Link DVI on this monitor. I've spent the last month or two looking around at all the newer monitors and I'm having a difficult time finding something I like and want to spend my money on. I'm not ready to spend $500+ on an OLED just yet, but I likely will within the next year when something nice catches my eye. Basically, I'm treating this current \"upgrade\" as my eventual second monitor, even though it will be my current main monitor. I have an old 24\" BenQ 1080p monitor I currently use as my secondary and I'll probably continue to use in vertical config once I have 3 monitors.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of video content, but I also do a good bit of other general task work, so I'm hesitant to get a VA monitor because once I get an OLED that will handle all the game/video content that requires the high contrast and refresh rates. I'd rather have an IPS for now since gaming has been fine on the QNIX (I don't play anything super competitive) and I don't want to deal with bad viewing angles or weird flicker. It seems like none of the last few years of IPS have gloss panels though, which is unfortunate because I really love how it looks on the QNIX.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions on a 27\" 1440p IPS and least 100/120hz for under $300? Ideally I don't want to spend over $200, and in the perfect world I'd love to find something for $100. How far back in time do I have to go to find a 2k IPS with a gloss screen that has HDMI or DP? I don't really care about HDR on this as it seems like the majority of IPS have bad implementation of it, and I can wait until an OLED for that anyways. It should also be VESA compatible so I can ditch the stand and put it on an arm, so I don't care if the stand is junk either.\n\nHopefully someone else has gone through this recently and can offer some suggestions. I feel like I'm in monitor hell digging through hundreds of reviews and threads trying to find what I want. I'm \\*this\\* close to just buying a cheap HDMI-DVI converter and living with 1440p@60hz until I get an OLED.",

    "selftext": "I'm purchasing a monitor setup for a home office. I'm primarily looking at text for document editing/review, email, video calls, etc. I'm upgrading from a 27\" 1080p screen, which is horribly grainy.\n\nI'm looking to get two 4k monitors and am currently between Dell's S2725QS (240USD) and U2725QE (630USD) models. The advantages of the QE appear to be a somewhat nicer picture, better build quality, and an internal hub, whereas the QS has no hub features at all. My gut says to get two of the much cheaper QS and connect everything with an external hub. However, I don't know how to assess if the difference in picture quality justifies the price difference of almost $400/screen. I'm very picky about picture quality and could afford the QE, but I don't want to drop the money for a marginal gain in how nice my word documents look. I could get one of each to take advantage of the hub in one, but I worry having two slightly different monitors next to one another would be distracting.\n\nAnyone have experience with these screens and can say whether the difference in quality is noticeable? Is having the hub inside the screen vs. in an external peripheral preferable? Or is there another monitor entirely I should be considering?",

I mostly code on the laptop, so I don’t necessarily want a gaming monitor (I game very rarely). I’m currently coming from a 24″ Full HD (1920×1080), 75 Hz ASUS monitor, and because my laptop has a 120 Hz screen I feel the difference — and I want an upgrade.  \nThe thing that frustrates me the most is **stutter** on the laptop’s screen (when the external monitor is connected), which I assume comes from the difference in refresh rate between the external monitor and the laptop screen. I thought about getting a monitor also at 120 Hz (same as the laptop), but I’ve heard many bad opinions about those monitors, so I’m open to any recommendation.  \nMy **only requirements** are:\n\n1. The monitor must be **at least 120 Hz**.\n2. The budget is up to **300 euros**. My main deal-breaker is the stutter. I really want to get rid of it. If you have suggestions or know what to look out for, I’d appreciate the help!",

One of the first things I want to get is a monitor that can work well for both productivity and gaming.\n\nHere’s my setup and what I’m looking for:\n\n* I have two laptops:\n   * A Legion 5 Pro (2021) gaming laptop (slightly old, but I mostly play FIFA on it; runs fine on low settings).\n   * A work laptop that I’ll use 8-9 hours a day for coding, documentation, and meetings.\n* I want a monitor that I can easily switch between both laptops (for example, one on HDMI, one on USB-C or DisplayPort).\n* I also plan to buy a PS5 soon, so I’d love a monitor that would be great for consoles too.\n\nI’m looking for something in the 27\"-32\" range. I’ll mostly use it for work during the day and for gaming/content (movies, YouTube, etc.) after hours.\n\nI was eyeing some OLED models but I’m a bit concerned about burn-in since the monitor will be on for long workdays. If OLED isn’t ideal for my use case, I’m open to high-quality IPS or VA panels too.\n\n**Budget:** Having a hard deciding this. On one hand, I do not want to spend much but on the other, I feel like it's a one-time investment for a long time and it does boost productivity too. Also, having experienced some high-end QLED TVs before, I am not easily impressed by displays.\n\nWould love recommendations or personal experiences with monitors that fit this mix of work + gaming + console use.\n\n**TL;DR: my main questions:**\n\n1. What panel type should I go for (OLED vs IPS vs VA)?\n2. Do OLED panels still have noticeable burn-in risk in 2025 for all-day work use?\n3. What resolution makes the most sense, is 4K worth it, or is QHD good enough?\n4. If I had to trade off quality to save money, is it better to go for QHD on a better panel or 4K on a worse one?\n5. Should I consider a dual-monitor setup, one for gaming/content and a cheaper one for static work tasks?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\n\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there. \n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D. \n\n\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a HUGE upgrade in sound clarity and detail. ",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are— 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it—do yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

They do seem to make them a bit less toasty (which was not a problem, but was noticeable with the stock pads for me). They also change the frequency response a bit, tilt it a bit to the high end, and open it up slightly. Not an improvement, for me, I like the warm, slightly more intimate feel of the stock pads a bit better, but not something that would stop me from using these either. Sound is still great. Edit: I had said that the sound isolation was not as good, but I am going back and forth now, and really, it is about the same. Also, going back and forth between the two, the sound difference really is minimal - it is there, but less then my initial impression. I don't hear much of a difference in bass either. I think the sound changes a little as the pads warm up, maybe the seal becomes a little better, and the differences, which are not much to begin with, decrease.\n\n Wondering what peoples impressions are, if anyone is still using these on their Maxwell? I am contemplating whether to keep them or not.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

The soundstage also surprised me; it’s natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head — soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn’t use them for workouts (they’re not built for that kind of movement), but they’re fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal — so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you’re in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you’ve already paired — that’s super convenient. Battery life is great too — around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere’s also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I’ve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I’ve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They’re not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they’re absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

I'll primarily be using them with my iPhone 12 Pro.\n\nI've been reading a lot about how using a Bluetooth dongle, like the Sennheiser BTD 600, is essential to get the absolute best sound quality out of these with an iPhone. The catch is that these dongles are USB-C and my iPhone is Lightning.\n\nI found this USB-C to Lightning adapter and was wondering a couple of things:\n * Has anyone here tried this kind of adapter setup with the BTD 600 and a Lightning iPhone? Does it actually work?\n * For those who have used the dongle with an iPhone/iOS device, does it really make a significant difference to the sound quality compared to the standard Bluetooth connection (which uses AAC)?\n\nAny advice would be awesome! Thanks in advance! 🎧\n",

    "selftext": "So the last few weeks I’ve been hunting for my first pair of real headphones. I’ve been using Astro A50s for a while they’re great for gaming, but man, they get super uncomfortable after like an hour.\n\nI’m totally new to the audiophile world, and holy hell, there are so many options. I had no clue where to start, so of course I did what any sane person would do I went to Reddit. I got a few a different suggestions but as I was searching through all of them I ended up looking up the Meze 109 pros and immediately fell in love with the looks. The wood finish on the cups matches my setup perfectly.\n\nSo I take the plunge — $800 on the 109 Pros and another $200 on a Topping DX3 Pro+. Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and… they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn’t notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I’d just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I’d give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two — same story. Day three, same thing at first… until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I’d never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I’m just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I’m not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

    "selftext": "First off, I am new to the headphone space so please excuse my lack of understanding.\n\nI have noticed that most reviewers, whether that's a review on YouTube, or an article on their website, place heavy emphasis on the frequency response curve. They will place this above all else when it comes to sound quality.\nFrom what I understand, frequency response curve is more indicative of a headphones 'sound signature' or what the manufacturer intended it to sound like but is not the only or imo main factor in the overall sound quality. \nFor example, when you compare a cheap pair of headphones to a more expensive one, no matter how well the cheap pair is tuned, it will still lack detail or resolution that the more expensive headphone will have (based on my experience). You might not hear the small variations in the artists vocals or the instruments. It can also lack clarity in the sound. \nSo, I feel, the frequency response curve is only one aspect of the overall sound quality, but there are many more things to consider and compare. You would expect an expensive pair of headphones to still sound 'better' even if it's not tuned closer to the Harman curve compared to a cheaper pair, just because of the better drivers, better materials and superior sound processing. \n\nIf so, why do reviews not talk about the rest of the factors affecting sound quality and focus almost purely on the sound signature, which to some extent can be fixed with an EQ, when the rest of it is not adjustable? \nSometimes they make it seem as if a well tuned $50 pair is better than a $400 pair which is better better build with better materials, with it's only shortcoming being a slightly worse tuning. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Or am I approaching this wrong?\nIs sound signature the defining factor in sound quality and listening experience or should we focus equally on things like clarity, resolution, ability to recreate the small variations in the sound, distortion?\nDo they avoid it because these other factors can't be quantified easily?

I found the ASH-IR-Dataset and just started messing with room impulse files. Then I tried one called Calypso, and that was the first time it actually felt like I was sitting in a room, not listening to a weird effect. The next game-changer was headphone correction. You have to EQ your headphones to a diffuse-field target first. It makes the headphones neutral for the simulation to work on.\n\nThat's when I found the ASH-Toolset. It took me literal days of tweaking to get a sound that wasn't just \"good\" but correct. You have to learn the settings because the defaults probably won't work for you. The most critical part is the HRTF dataset (the \"dummy head\" recordings). You have to test them all (KEMAR, KU 100, etc.) Your ears are physically unique. The HRTF that's perfect for me will sound weird and wrong to you. If you don't find the one that anatomically clicks with your brain, you will never get that true \"in front of you\" sound.\n\nFor the first time in my life, music is actually in front of me, originating from a point in space outside my head. I'm now listening to music I've ignored for years (acoustic, live concerts, old rock) and it's more engaging than the metal I've lived on for 5 years, because I can hear the actual space in the recording. The effect is insane on my IEMs, super precise and immersive. On my HD 650s, it's also incredible, but the sense of space is wider and less \"in your face,\" a totally different but equally cool vibe. If you're tired of the gimmicks and want to hear what's really possible, this is the way.\n\n(I don't know English well, so I apologize if something is written incorrectly.)\n\nupd: I wrote a short instruction on how to start using the dataset - [https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/)",

Which freaks me out a bit. I want something that’ll last a few years, not fall apart after a short time even if you take really good care of them.\n\nEveryone says they’re the best-sounding gaming headset out there, which really makes me want them, but I’m not sure if I can trust the reliability.\n\nSo for anyone who owns them, are they actually worth it in the long run, or should I look at something else?",

    "selftext": "Hello. Posting here cause headphone advice auto deleted this. :( \n\nI have the DT 1990 Pros (not MKII) currently, the left driver stopped working like a week ago or so. I decided to google what could be the cause, something led me to believe that the coil wire(?), the ultra thin varnished tiny wire was broken, so I opened it and sure enough it was. Replacement drivers are $192, I bought mine in 2022 for $550. New ones now cost $300\\~$350 depending on sales and such. So I was thinking is it even worth repairing at this point or just upgrade to better headphones. My choice that I landed on (kinda heavily at this stage) are the Meze 109 Pros. I am waiting for a sale for them as I've seen them as low as $628 or so, instead of the $750 they are right now (with coupon or something). I've seen a lot of reviews of these and lot's of people say these could be considered \"end game?\" for a lot of people. I am by no means an audiophile so fair enough in this case. Another thing I heard is the cable provided with these is kinda \"meh\" for the price of the headphones and suggestions seem to say to upgrade it. Not sure to what though. Any input is wholly welcomed. Thanks!\n\nBudget I'm hoping to stick under $800.\n\nMainly for listening to music or playing a few games like Rust and such\n\nI have the SMSL AO300 AMP\n\nAny input is wholly welcomed.

But for nu-metal (Limp Bizkit and others) and electronic music, I wanted something more atmospheric and physical.  \nI listen to music on different devices and software, so EQ isn’t really an option. I like character — not neutrality.\n\nMy first shortlist was Fostex TH900 Mk2 and Sony MRZ-1, but none were available.  \nI ended up getting the FatFreq Deuce — the IEMs with the most powerful sub-bass I’ve ever heard.\n\nThen the Virtuoso was announced, and after auditioning them twice, I finally added them to my collection.\n\n**Cons for first:**\n\nFor around $1000, you get a fancy case and Alcantara on the headband and pads. That’s it. The rest of the materials and build quality feel cheap as shit. Fit isn’t particularly comfortable either. The screw-in cable connectors make me question the design logic.  \nMaybe I’m just spoiled by Meze, but overall it feels far from premium.\n\n**Sound**\n\nTested on iBasso Nunchaku, Chord Mojo 2, Astell&Kern ACRO CA1000T, and Cayin HA-2A.  \nI don’t feel any difference between the gear, so don’t overpay for it.\n\nOverall, the sound is moderately detailed with good instrument separation —  \nan aggressive V-shape with some interesting midrange nuance.  \nThe louder it gets, the richer and denser it becomes.\n\n**Bass**:  \nStrong and plentiful, but not aggressive. Moderately textured, adds weight and body.  \nElectronic and hip-hop tracks sound fantastic.\n\n**Treble**:  \nThere’s a lot of it. Crisp, sometimes aggressive on cymbals — reminds me of the Meze 109 Pro.\n\n**Mids**:  \nThis is where it gets interesting. A&K seems to have borrowed Ultrasone’s S-Logic spatial trickery,  \nso vocals float “in the air”. When the music carries ambient layers or atmospheric elements, it’s genuinely captivating.\n\nOverall, the sound is unusual yet very pleasant — cohesive, engaging, and fun to listen to.\n\nPosting this because there are almost no reviews or proper FR measurements online.  \nIf you’re looking for something unique and a bit different, maybe this will help.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I need some advice from the Audeze experts here. I'm about to buy a used LCD-X and I'm confused about which version it is.\n\n**The Facts:**\n\n* Serial Number: **7526658**\n* Purchased new: **March 10, 2021** from xxxx (authorized Swiss dealer)\n* Original invoice included\n* Current asking price: **\\~€850)** \\- seems like a good deal\n\n**The Confusion:** According to what I found online, LCD-X units with serial numbers **7527600 or higher** should be the 2021 revision. This one is 7526658, so technically *below* that threshold.\n\n**BUT** \\- and this is where it gets interesting - **the headphone has ALL the 2021 visual characteristics:**\n\n* ✅ Modern suspension headband (not the old rigid design)\n* ✅ Metal mesh grills (not fabric)\n* ✅ New shiny leather earpads (not the old memory foam style)\n* ✅ Overall 2021 aesthetic\n\nThe seller confirms **everything is original** \\- nothing has been replaced or upgraded. He bought it exactly like this in March 2021.\n\n**My Theory:** Could this be an early 2021 production unit or a transition model for the European market? Maybe Audeze started the 2021 revision slightly before the \"official\" serial number threshold, especially for international markets?\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Has anyone seen LCD-X units with 2021 components but serial numbers below 7527600?\n2. Do you think this is actually a 2021 model that just happened to get an earlier serial number?\n3. At 850 EUROS with all 2021 components visible, is this a no-brainer purchase even if there's uncertainty?\n\nI've contacted Audeze support but thought I'd ask the community too. Any insights would be really appreciated!\n\n**TL;DR:** LCD-X serial 7526658 (below 2021 threshold) but has all 2021 physical features. Bought new March 2021. Is it a 2021 model? Worth buying at €850?",

    "title": "Trying to further my understanding of headphone power needs",
    "selftext": "I made a post in HeadohonesAdvice recently asking about the plausibility of running a pair of Sennheiser HD 600 off a dongle dac. At least half of the purpose of me asking is to learn more about the technical side of this audio technology, because I love learning and I have a strong desire to understand how things work. Having a strong base of knowledge can make me a more informed consumer if nothing else. \n\nThe responses ranged from “no dongle will really provide enough power to run those headphones properly, even if it sounds loud enough” to “amps are snake oil, don’t waste your money, just use an Apple dongle or, if you really want to blast it, get a fiio ka11 or something.”\n\nI found it truly interesting that both sides of this argument vehemently insist they are correct, which leads me to believe the science that goes into answering a question like this must be very nuanced and not at all black and white. \n\nStarting with the “why volume doesn’t always mean enough power” argument, the best explanation I could find is that dynamic drivers don’t have consistent voltage needs across the entire audio spectrum. More specifically, the bass and upper treble have more power needs, and that power form what I’ve gathered is voltage for volume and current for driver control. I may be oversimplifying or possibly just wrong so forgive me, but the broader point is that even if the sound in general sounds loud enough and is therefore getting enough power, parts of the frequency response might not be getting what they need especially when it comes to music with a lot of dynamic range or large peaks in volume. The idea here is that “it sounds loud enough to me” could be an incomplete picture. \n\nOn the other side of the argument I’m seeing that the above argument is a hypothetical and over complicated concern, that for a high-impedance set like the HD 600 if you can get it loud enough for normal listening then you are supplying it with all the power it needs since voltage equals volume and voltage is the main concern with a headphone like this (as opposed to a set that has low impedance but high current needs). Even Crinacle, a popular figure in the audiophile space, claims that something like the ka11 can provide “way too much power” and could easily run a set of HD 800s at “ear-splitting volume”.  Not that his word is gold, or anything, but he still strikes me as someone with a lot of experience and knowledge. \n\nMeanwhile back on the other side again, you can look up power calculators for headphones that more or less verify most dongles won’t be able to supply the necessary voltage or current for high impedance headphones to run at max potential/without clipping part of the frequency response. \n\nApologies for the wall of text here, I just wanted to provide context for the rabbit hole I’m going down. I should make it clear I’m not “worried” about this, I’m perfectly happy to enjoy my headphones and my music without wringing my hands worrying if I’m doing it properly. This is purely because I want to learn. I like learning. It’s that simple. And in service of that, I’d be interested to hear more detailed information on either side of this argument. Correct me where I’m wrong, elaborate where I’m oversimplifying, provide additional context I might not be considering. The folks here seem passionate and knowledgeable and I would be grateful if any of you would be willing to share your wisdom with me in the name of learning new things!",

Each has its own usecase, but I guess you get what I mean.\nI think that to me it mostly just makes me not wanna buy anything beyond the tier I’m currently at even though it can be pretty tempting to know what a really expensive pair can sound like and how much better sound can get, I just kinda know that even a 2,000$ pair would eventually just become normal!\nAm I making sense here?\n",

Decided to test out on the AirPod 3 pro since this version has now a small nozzle and to my surprise, most of the tips work fine, especially the SpinFit CP240 Double-Flange as seen in the pics. The fit is great and the tip wraps nicely around the oval nozzle. Since the isolation increases drastically, the perceived ANC increased too. \n\n  \nHas anyone tried this out?",

    "selftext": "I have just gotten the Dunu Arashi. I would not believe that this was Dunu's first go at a full sized cans if I haven't known about it. The execution was *very refined*, and I am left with thoughts in my head about how heated this 1000 dollar segment of open back market truly is. \n\nThe balance of weight (500g) by a very reliable strap mechanism that just makes Hifiman's Arya straps feel flimsy really comes to me immediately. The attention to detail really stood out. Dunu's only real flaw here with their beautiful built XLR and quarter inch cables (3.5mm entry at that, with the dual entries angled to the back, a classy decision) is the length being a bit unwieldy as with \"audiophile\" phones of ere. Would have liked to see Dunu flex their IEM cable mastery even more by featuring modular cable termination. \n\nThe presentation is not as \"in-your-face\" as with the DK3001BD Braindance, although the sub-bass and the bass made me think that this is what I'd get if I stick that 30ohm impedance adapter to the Braindance to lift the midbass on that divisive set of IEMs (which I adore).  The soundstage width is quite good, but depth is only mediocre. Feels like Dunu purposely put them just a touch out of focus, as they easily come into focus on a gentle EQ to Kemar DF target. You won't be as floored as with say Arya Organic in the sheer soundstage, but these aren't as closed as say Focal.\n\nWhen compared to what I have on hand, I think that their timbre is very natural and refined. The Utopia OG in comparison is immensely capable even with their passionate presentation as they boast even more accented macrodynamic with the \"slam\". The Noire X feel subdued and much more 'clinical'. HD800S and HD700 possess immense soundstage and separation, but they might be fatiguing in comparison to these.\n\nI have tried them with Qudelix-5k even just from the unbalanced 3.5mm, and with BTR17, but scaling to full sized amp such as K17/K19 is still recommended). I think what you use for a serious IEM amp setup will work beautifully with the Arashi. Don't use bottom rung amp and dac as you'd feel that you've cheated yourself from what these cans can do. \n\nThe Arashi isn't out to offend, and they can really be driven by portable source.  You can be very happy even just listening to Spotify and YouTube uploaded music with these, as the timbre with the finesse of the bass here make for very easy listen. \n\nYeah. Do color me greatly impressed. The finely controlled subbass to bass is the absolute star of the show here. ",

    "title": "PSVANE Summit 6SN7 Tube Review",
    "selftext": "Alright, some of you might remember when I raved about the PSVANE Horizon tubes a while back. For the money, they were just fantastic, a real sweet spot of musicality and detail that honestly felt like a steal. So when I heard they were releasing a Summit series, I was both excited and skeptical. Let's be real, in the world of HiFi, \"better\" usually just means a lot more expensive. I had to know if they could actually top the Horizon series in a meaningful way.\nWell, after a few weeks with the Summit 6SN7, I can tell you this: they did!\n\nThe review again was done using mypreamp Schitt Freya+. The first 20-30 hours of burn in were a little bit of a ride. Initially, things felt a bit constrained, a little too polite. I was worried. But I left it running and came back the next day, and that's when it started to open up. The soundstage just bloomed. I put on \"No Time to Die\" by Billie Eilish, a track I've used for testing forever, and the texture of the instruments and background was staggering. It wasn't just detail for detail's sake, you could feel the room where it was recorded with Hans Zimmer orchestrating it.\n\nWhat really sold me, though, was the bass. My old VT231s have great bass, but the Summit brings a level of control and speed that's just different. It's taut and deep without ever feeling bloated. On tracks with complex electronic basslines, where other tubes can turn things into a bit of a muddy mess, the Summit keeps every layer clean and defined. There's no comparison to a stock EH or Ray tube in this department and it’s not even a fair fight.\n\nAfter having rolled so many 6SN7s over the years, NOS Sylvania VT231s, Ray tubes, Electro Harmonix, vintage chrome dome Sylvanias, and all the rest, the PSVANE Summit Series 6SN7 still manages to grab hold of your attention in a way that few modern tubes do. If you are chasing detail, transparency, and excellent bass control, this tube should be on your shortlist. It is not just good for what modern tubes do, it approximates the best tubes I have ever heard, including the Sylvania VT231 family.\n\nMicro detail in cymbal overtones, string nuances, and the trailing decay of piano notes all emerge with clarity. It does not shout look at me, but rather quietly reveals what is there in full fidelity. \n\nIt leans just a hair warm, but in a really tasteful way. It's not the kind of syrupy warmth that smothers detail. It’s more of a natural glow that takes the edge off harsh digital recordings without sacrificing the bite. It makes vocals, both male and female, sound incredibly rich and present.\n\nI ran the Summit through a few of my favorite solid-state amps to see how it would behave. It’s not an overly picky tube, but the character of the amp definitely plays a huge role in the final sound.\n• Aune S17 Pro EVO: This was probably the most straightforward and balanced pairing. The S17 has a massive reserve of clean, Class A power and a very neutral, detailed presentation. The Summit tube slotted in nicely, adding a welcome dose of warmth and dimensionality without taking away from the amp's technical strengths. It's a great all-arounder. The only critique I have is that it can feel a little... polite. \n• Pass Labs HPA-1: If you're a fan of rich, romantic, and velvety sound, this pairing might be for you, but it comes with a serious warning: this is where you can have too much of a good thing. The HPA-1 already has a smooth, warm character. Adding the Summit on top results in a sound that is incredibly lush and forgiving, but it sacrifices a significant amount of speed and bite. For slow jazz or vocals, it's gorgeous. But for anything fast-paced like rock or electronic music, the bass loses its tautness and the whole presentation can feel a bit sluggish and overly thick.\n• Holo Bliss + May KTE chain: Two words END GAME. This setup is an absolute microscope. It’s so incredibly resolving that it tells you everything about the gear you plug into it, for better or worse. On one hand, the Summit's strengths its rich harmonics and soundstage depth were on full display. It sounded huge and impressive. \n\nHeadphones \n• Sennheiser HD600: Oh, man. This is the one. If you own an HD600, this pairing is a must-hear. It takes everything the headphone is famous for that gorgeous, neutral midrange and injects a dose of emotion and space. It’s like the soundstage suddenly grew in all directions. Listening to Jeff Buckley's Grace, his voice was so nuanced and layered, it was almost haunting. It’s not just a change, it’s a transformation.\n• Sennheiser HD800S: The Summit is the perfect antidote for the HD800's occasional surgical nature. It doesn't kill the detail or the incredible imaging, but it melts away that analytical edge that can lead to fatigue. That slight treble peak? Tamed. The bass, which can feel a bit light on the HD800, now has real authority. It turns the HD800 from a studio tool into an instrument of pure immersion.\n• Audeze LCD-X (2021): The Summit gives it soul. I threw on some Rage Against the Machine, and the snares had this incredible skin texture, and synths had a satisfying throb. It adds that liquid, tubey goodness that planar fans often crave without sacrificing the speed and punch.\n• Hifiman HE1000SE: If you want your system to sound luxurious, this is it. The HE1000SE is already a technical marvel, but the Summit gives it a visceral, tactile quality. Strings feel like they're being played right in front of you. The whole presentation is just effortless and grand.\n• Hifiman Arya Organic: The Summit is a great match here, calming down the Arya's sometimes clinical presentation. It softens the edges just enough to make it more poetic and less like a microscope, filling out the mids and giving the sound a more three dimensional, immersive feel.\n\nOkay, it can't all be sunshine and roses, right? \nFirst, let's talk about the elephant in the room: the price. These are not cheap tubes. They command a significant premium over the Horizon series and most other new production 6SN7s. In relation to the Ray select, the Summit series is a bargain and honestly outright beats it in performance and price. While the performance jump is real, you start hitting the law of diminishing returns when compared to the Horizon series. The Summit is a clear step up, but it's not 3x the performance for 3x the price. For many, the Horizon will still be the smarter buy, offering 85% of the performance for a fraction of the cost. What would I choose since most will comment and ask, without a doubt the Summit series. It's simple bliss and believe it's a bargain at even the asking price. It's makes all the difference. \n\nFor me, it has earned a permanent spot in my system. It reminds me why I got into this crazy hobby in the first place.\n",

Like you can not physically even TOUCH your own ear without at least touching one of these earbuds once, screwing up any chance of listening to music. \n\nSecond, they promise a charging bank that charges fast, and... it can't even do that. There's like 2 areas to plug in the charger at, and when I do plug it in. It EATS up the power bank with slow charging (seriously it asked me to charge it for 20 fucking hours)\n\nBut the primary reason why Im saying this review... is because of one little thing that pisses me off so much. A SINGLE day of having these earbuds, they instantly stop working and refuse to enter pairing mode. And I dont know how to fix it. The manual it comes with doesnt help, and when I tried looking online, there were none if not ANY reviews or solutions. \n\nThis pair of earbuds gets a 2/10. Do not recommend paying 10-15$ for these 1 day earbuds that break in a day.",

    "selftext": "I’m trying to take some more care of my hearing because I’m starting to get tinnitus as far as I can tell, so I bought a decibel meter to measure some ambients and its sounds. \n\nOne of them are my headphones. I measured it and it was between 45-70dB basically all the time. But when I turned on the MAX option it showed that it had some peaks of like 90dB. This is really loud, but I didn’t heard any loud sound.\n\nShould I consider these high peaks and lower the volume? (that’s already low btw).\n\nAlso, I think that staying under 65dB plus taking breaks is ideal to prevent hearing loss. Is this correct?\n\n",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\n\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there. \n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D. \n\n\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a HUGE upgrade in sound clarity and detail. ",

Literally stood there with my mouth hanging open.\n\nThere were hundreds of headphones on display that day, but none of them came close to what the Grado delivered. The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are— 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it—do yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "selftext": "I'm new to tube amps, especially OTL. Pictured here are the Sennheiser HD 660s (150 Ohm) and the Woo Audio WA3 (advertised 30-600 Ohm output impedance). I understand that, very very simply, the idea of higher impedance headphones is to allow higher fidelity if powered correctly. But would a somewhat lower 150 Ohm set like this still get a lot out of the WA3? I know I'm overcomplicating this since, yes, I do enjoy the sound quality as is, but would I make marked gains with something higher, like even a 300 Ohm HD 650? Thanks in advance.",

    "title": "Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones Gen 2 Review",
    "selftext": "I’ve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say — these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural — vocals, instruments, bass — nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven’t noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it’s natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head — soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn’t use them for workouts (they’re not built for that kind of movement), but they’re fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal — so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you’re in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you’ve already paired — that’s super convenient. Battery life is great too — around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere’s also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I’ve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I’ve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They’re not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they’re absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

    "selftext": "So the last few weeks I’ve been hunting for my first pair of real headphones. I’ve been using Astro A50s for a while they’re great for gaming, but man, they get super uncomfortable after like an hour.\n\nI’m totally new to the audiophile world, and holy hell, there are so many options. I had no clue where to start, so of course I did what any sane person would do I went to Reddit. I got a few a different suggestions but as I was searching through all of them I ended up looking up the Meze 109 pros and immediately fell in love with the looks. The wood finish on the cups matches my setup perfectly.\n\nSo I take the plunge — $800 on the 109 Pros and another $200 on a Topping DX3 Pro+. Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and… they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn’t notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I’d just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I’d give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two — same story. Day three, same thing at first… until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I’d never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I’m just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I’m not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

They do seem to make them a bit less toasty (which was not a problem, but was noticeable with the stock pads for me). They also change the frequency response a bit, tilt it a bit to the high end, and open it up slightly. Not an improvement, for me, I like the warm, slightly more intimate feel of the stock pads a bit better, but not something that would stop me from using these either. Sound is still great. Edit: I had said that the sound isolation was not as good, but I am going back and forth now, and really, it is about the same. Also, going back and forth between the two, the sound difference really is minimal - it is there, but less then my initial impression. I don't hear much of a difference in bass either. I think the sound changes a little as the pads warm up, maybe the seal becomes a little better, and the differences, which are not much to begin with, decrease.\n\n Wondering what peoples impressions are, if anyone is still using these on their Maxwell? I am contemplating whether to keep them or not.",

    "selftext": "I've tried pretty much every \"spatial audio\" VST and DSP out there, and 99% of it is garbage. Just weird tricks that sound fake. Recently I learned about convolution. I found the ASH-IR-Dataset and just started messing with room impulse files. Then I tried one called Calypso, and that was the first time it actually felt like I was sitting in a room, not listening to a weird effect. The next game-changer was headphone correction. You have to EQ your headphones to a diffuse-field target first. It makes the headphones neutral for the simulation to work on.\n\nThat's when I found the ASH-Toolset. It took me literal days of tweaking to get a sound that wasn't just \"good\" but correct. You have to learn the settings because the defaults probably won't work for you. The most critical part is the HRTF dataset (the \"dummy head\" recordings). You have to test them all (KEMAR, KU 100, etc.) Your ears are physically unique. The HRTF that's perfect for me will sound weird and wrong to you. If you don't find the one that anatomically clicks with your brain, you will never get that true \"in front of you\" sound.\n\nFor the first time in my life, music is actually in front of me, originating from a point in space outside my head. I'm now listening to music I've ignored for years (acoustic, live concerts, old rock) and it's more engaging than the metal I've lived on for 5 years, because I can hear the actual space in the recording. The effect is insane on my IEMs, super precise and immersive. On my HD 650s, it's also incredible, but the sense of space is wider and less \"in your face,\" a totally different but equally cool vibe. If you're tired of the gimmicks and want to hear what's really possible, this is the way.\n\n(I don't know English well, so I apologize if something is written incorrectly.)\n\nupd: I wrote a short instruction on how to start using the dataset - [https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/)",

    "selftext": "First off, I am new to the headphone space so please excuse my lack of understanding.\n\nI have noticed that most reviewers, whether that's a review on YouTube, or an article on their website, place heavy emphasis on the frequency response curve. They will place this above all else when it comes to sound quality.\nFrom what I understand, frequency response curve is more indicative of a headphones 'sound signature' or what the manufacturer intended it to sound like but is not the only or imo main factor in the overall sound quality. \nFor example, when you compare a cheap pair of headphones to a more expensive one, no matter how well the cheap pair is tuned, it will still lack detail or resolution that the more expensive headphone will have (based on my experience). You might not hear the small variations in the artists vocals or the instruments. It can also lack clarity in the sound. \nSo, I feel, the frequency response curve is only one aspect of the overall sound quality, but there are many more things to consider and compare. You would expect an expensive pair of headphones to still sound 'better' even if it's not tuned closer to the Harman curve compared to a cheaper pair, just because of the better drivers, better materials and superior sound processing. \n\nIf so, why do reviews not talk about the rest of the factors affecting sound quality and focus almost purely on the sound signature, which to some extent can be fixed with an EQ, when the rest of it is not adjustable? \nSometimes they make it seem as if a well tuned $50 pair is better than a $400 pair which is better better build with better materials, with it's only shortcoming being a slightly worse tuning. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Or am I approaching this wrong?\nIs sound signature the defining factor in sound quality and listening experience or should we focus equally on things like clarity, resolution, ability to recreate the small variations in the sound, distortion?\nDo they avoid it because these other factors can't be quantified easily?

But for nu-metal (Limp Bizkit and others) and electronic music, I wanted something more atmospheric and physical.  \nI listen to music on different devices and software, so EQ isn’t really an option. I like character — not neutrality.\n\nMy first shortlist was Fostex TH900 Mk2 and Sony MRZ-1, but none were available.  \nI ended up getting the FatFreq Deuce — the IEMs with the most powerful sub-bass I’ve ever heard.\n\nThen the Virtuoso was announced, and after auditioning them twice, I finally added them to my collection.\n\n**Cons for first:**\n\nFor around $1000, you get a fancy case and Alcantara on the headband and pads. That’s it. The rest of the materials and build quality feel cheap as shit. Fit isn’t particularly comfortable either. The screw-in cable connectors make me question the design logic.  \nMaybe I’m just spoiled by Meze, but overall it feels far from premium.\n\n**Sound**\n\nTested on iBasso Nunchaku, Chord Mojo 2, Astell&Kern ACRO CA1000T, and Cayin HA-2A.  \nI don’t feel any difference between the gear, so don’t overpay for it.\n\nOverall, the sound is moderately detailed with good instrument separation —  \nan aggressive V-shape with some interesting midrange nuance.  \nThe louder it gets, the richer and denser it becomes.\n\n**Bass**:  \nStrong and plentiful, but not aggressive. Moderately textured, adds weight and body.  \nElectronic and hip-hop tracks sound fantastic.\n\n**Treble**:  \nThere’s a lot of it. Crisp, sometimes aggressive on cymbals — reminds me of the Meze 109 Pro.\n\n**Mids**:  \nThis is where it gets interesting. A&K seems to have borrowed Ultrasone’s S-Logic spatial trickery,  \nso vocals float “in the air”. When the music carries ambient layers or atmospheric elements, it’s genuinely captivating.\n\nOverall, the sound is unusual yet very pleasant — cohesive, engaging, and fun to listen to.\n\nPosting this because there are almost no reviews or proper FR measurements online.  \nIf you’re looking for something unique and a bit different, maybe this will help.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! 👋\n\nJust grabbed a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 4s! I'm definitely not an audiophile, but I seriously value good sound quality. I'll primarily be using them with my iPhone 12 Pro.\n\nI've been reading a lot about how using a Bluetooth dongle, like the Sennheiser BTD 600, is essential to get the absolute best sound quality out of these with an iPhone. The catch is that these dongles are USB-C and my iPhone is Lightning.\n\nI found this USB-C to Lightning adapter and was wondering a couple of things:\n * Has anyone here tried this kind of adapter setup with the BTD 600 and a Lightning iPhone? Does it actually work?\n * For those who have used the dongle with an iPhone/iOS device, does it really make a significant difference to the sound quality compared to the standard Bluetooth connection (which uses AAC)?\n\nAny advice would be awesome! Thanks in advance! 🎧\n",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\n\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there. \n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D. \n\n\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a HUGE upgrade in sound clarity and detail. ",

Literally stood there with my mouth hanging open.\n\nThere were hundreds of headphones on display that day, but none of them came close to what the Grado delivered. The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are— 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it—do yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

    "title": "Had an opportunity to try the LCD-X, & my comparisons to the Edition XS.",
    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "selftext": "I’ve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say — these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural — vocals, instruments, bass — nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven’t noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it’s natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head — soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn’t use them for workouts (they’re not built for that kind of movement), but they’re fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal — so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you’re in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you’ve already paired — that’s super convenient. Battery life is great too — around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere’s also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I’ve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I’ve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They’re not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they’re absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

    "selftext": "So the last few weeks I’ve been hunting for my first pair of real headphones. I’ve been using Astro A50s for a while they’re great for gaming, but man, they get super uncomfortable after like an hour.\n\nI’m totally new to the audiophile world, and holy hell, there are so many options. I had no clue where to start, so of course I did what any sane person would do I went to Reddit. I got a few a different suggestions but as I was searching through all of them I ended up looking up the Meze 109 pros and immediately fell in love with the looks. The wood finish on the cups matches my setup perfectly.\n\nSo I take the plunge — $800 on the 109 Pros and another $200 on a Topping DX3 Pro+. Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and… they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn’t notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I’d just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I’d give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two — same story. Day three, same thing at first… until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I’d never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I’m just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I’m not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

Well, they all sound horrible to me which plays into the logic I had about EQ prior to any of this.\n\nHow am I going to sound like a high end piece on a low end gear?\n\nTake the 990, say I wanted to try the HD800s profile, I autoEQ and apply it to the 990, wouldn't it sound like ass? Surely, the tech on a $1500 headphones is what makes the tuning shine right? If I can just transfer it to a $150 gear, why bother with expensive gear?

    "selftext": "Hey\nI really don't post much in this place but  this is very urgent so I'll go ahead and get to the main point right away\nSo this morning I woke up to find my steam deck in the home menu despite not touching anything last night when I slept, it was still on nested desktop (and for those that need an explanation, every night I would launch nested desktop, fire up YouTube and then put up a screensaver and some music to then fall asleep too, it's weird but that's what I usually do)\nAnyhow when I went to return to nested desktop to stop the video and turn off my deck, I noticed that both the Steam and ... Buttons weren't responding and the power button wasn't working much either so I went ahead and did a force shutdown to fully turn it off, when I went ahead and rebooted the steam deck, it took an uncomfortable amount to boot up (like, a bit longer than I expected) and then imagine my shock when it booted into the initial setup screen and despite rebooting at least two times it was still on the initial setup screen so I went ahead with the setup and then I found that all the games and files I had on my internal drive were gone.\n\nthe files I had on my sd card were perfectly fine thankfully but by that point I have gotten very scared and I went ahead and checked desktop mode to see if there was anything different and lo and behold it got reset top alongside any settings and files I have set up there (minus some applications that weirdly enough stuck around when the reset happened) which was very upsetting cause I had many files and and applications that I use daily and to see it be gone is very upsetting.\nAnyhow, thankfully I still have my original 512gb ssd that has all my old stuff in there, now the real question would be if it would be a good idea to transfer the installation from my old SSD to the now reset SSD or would anything weird would happen if I did that? Sorry if I'm all over the place with this post I am just incredibly stressed right now that it happened so suddenly and I am just searching for solutions to restore the stuff I had on my internal SSD😭 thank you all for reading this, hopefully a solution will come up soon",

Recently it's been as low as 42% and gave me a warning to replace it. I was flabbergasted ordered a replacement battery from ifixit. I've since then recalibrated the battery, but it still tends to fluctuate to low 80s and high 70s. \n\nAt the same time, my right stick had stick drift and the left stick's deadzone is off-centered. So, I ended up getting the gullit sticks. Atm, I didn't install them yet, because it seems like the stick drift is gone.\n\nMy question is: now that I got the sticks and battery pack, is it fine if I kept the new parts as backups in case things go south again (past 50% health, severe stick drift), or do I need to replace the questionable parts immediately?

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI hope you are all well and enjoying your decks! \n\nI wasn't too sure if I should do this update, I have been getting much weaker as the weeks and days go by and gaming of any kind has become almost impossible it feels. I struggle to play more than an hour but I do try! I am finding myself losing weight faster than ever before, my strength has all but gone, and I struggle greatly with nausea so much even as I try to write this I am having to take breaks, so just please understand that ALL I want to do is chat and play with all of you, I would love to do nothing more but its becoming harder and harder. \n\nEven then we still GAME ON! I have been bedridden so much that watching movies and tv shows is something I can do much easier, so maybe you could drop your fave tv shows and films as well as games!\n\nand lastly before the review, I wondered if it would be worthwhile creating a discord server, where anyone who's bothered could come by and chat, hang out, etc. If you think it could be a good idea, let me know!\n\nDying Light: The Beast - WOW! When I first remember playing Dying Light 1, I was truly blown away, it felt like what I always wanted Dead Island to be, this ultra realistic zombie game, and it just delivered on every level, it made zombies SCARY again, you can't fight hordes, 3 or 4 is a decent battle, the night was scary and the Stalkers! wow. Then came 2, and whilst it developed on every element from the first game, it somehow, mistreated them. \n\nNight was no longer scary, the traversal didn't feel as fun, and it just felt TOO BIG, a bit BLOATED, and I didn't care like I did in 1. So, when Dying Light - The Beast was announced, I actually wasn't too excited, but once it launched all I heard was good things, now I have only played around 4 hours  but those were some of the most exciting, thrilling and scary hours of gaming in a LONG time. The graphics are sublime, the gore, the combat, traversal, it is all for me..perfect in every single way. If you loved 1, then this will be your perfect new zombie game, if you felt let down by 2, this is the game to revitalise that love of killing zombies. \n\nSilent Hill f - Whilst I have only started, it is only my second foray into the Silent Hill world. Now I LOVE Halloween, and I find dev's filmmakers, anyone really when it comes to Horror, they kinda throw in a few jump scares and say \"It's a scary game\" so I love when a game is fully fleshed out, the in's and out's, the themes, the pure scariness! Well, I have pretty much switched Silent Hill f straight off, like right click and close window, because it's CREEPY. The sound design is incredible, and just makes the entire world far more scary. I am still only just pulling back the cover but I am loving it!\n\nI HOPE to be somewhat better soon where I can at least play some games, or just feel like I can exist for a few hours. I always want to be honest with all of you, and the fact is depression is something I have fought with help from my family, but the last few weeks, I have just felt lower, and lower. Everyday is harder, and I am struggling more than ever. I have support, I have people, but there's an finality setting in, an understanding that my mum can't just be a MUM and fix this, I think maybe it is all catching up to me. \n\nThank you once again for taking your time to read this and being apart of this journey, I apologise for the gap between these posts but I am just shedding weight, I look in the mirror and I don't know who I see, for the first time I looked at myself and truly admitted. \"I am sick, this is it\". It has been tough, but whenever I have felt down either Reddit or Steam will ping and someone will be checking in, someone will be seeing how I am, and that..that really keeps me going. So each and everyone of you mean the world to me. \n\n  \nI hope more than anything to continue my silly updates, we have a new Football manager coming out, Outer worlds 2! Vampire: Masquerade 2! and that just a few amazing experiences that I hold on to, seeing my family everyday, speaking with you all, and looking forward to games, that's a core of my push each day and it works so far :')\n\nOnce again, thank you for taking time to read this, and I hope to hear from you all. \n\nAdd me on Steam anytime! 82871772\n\nAnd if you fancy joining my Discord server, so we have somewhere to chat - https://discord.gg/TjRhH2Ye\n\nM",

    "selftext": "Ok, story time. \n\nI've used a lot of handhelds. I've been a console gamer before I got my first steam deck 2/3 years ago. I loved it. Easy setup, portable gaming....it was awesome.\n\nThen the SD oled released and I upgraded. I loved that thing. Gorgeous screen, lighter, smaller bezels. The possibilities were endless. \n\nThen the ally x was released. I started chasing power. My first thought: man, the power is awesome, 120hz, VRR... But I never loved it. Screen was smaller than the steamdeck and I missed oled. \nI sold that after 6 months and bought the SD oled again... But this time, I also built a pretty good gaming pc. \n\nI sold my Xbox series x. that was the end of console gaming for me. I was set. \n\nThen the legion go s came along. I had to have it. 8 inch screen goodness, 120hz, VRR, steam os? Sign me up! So I sold the SD oled, again! 2 months later I realized The ergonomics were terrible for me. It was too heavy, the grips were too thicc, Battery life sucked, don't even ask about that track pad. While pc streaming worked... It didn't have hdr. And it cost a lot more than the SD oled. \n\nI randomly got an amazing deal on the msi claw 8 ai + (paid $700) and wow. It was impressive. Sold the legion go s immediately. Although not oled, the screen is gorgeous. It ran everything I threw at it. Regular Intel updates, smooth gameplay.. Lunar lake really has a good thing going.\n\n Problem was though, it wasn't comfy to hold. I was streaming a lot to save battery (I know it has an 80whr battery but I didn't want to ignore my pc) and then it hit me... I just need a handheld to stream from my pc and not replace my pc. \n\nSo here I am again. Back to SD oled and I'm in love again. I found a great deal on the white LE for $500.\n\nIt's been a long journey to realize that the SD oled fits my use case (keyword here is \"my use case\") . I hope this helps someone. It's not always about chasing the latest specs, it's finding what works for your specific use case. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I recently gave this game a second run and came to the conclusion that it was much better the second time around. The steam deck plays it flawless and I enjoyed it for what it was.\n\nIf you have not played this game, skip the yt reviews, the game was criticized for the repetitive missions - and boy are they repetitive 😂. This is a 3rd person shooter / driving game. I do agree on this criticism 100%, but at the same time, if that's the case, is a basketball game classified as sports is also repetitive?\n\nThe soundtrack is fire. So much so, on spotify and  yt, most songs in this game are on any \"top 60s\" playlist.\n\nThe graphics range enough for Steam Deck in a way that. When handheld, putting the quality settings to \"low\" for nearly 3 hours of game play (maybe more on OLED)and when docked you max the settings for a much better visual.\n\nThe story is really good and you have options that change the trajectory of your game as you go along. \n\nThe bad:\nThey could have made a better upgrade system which to me was the biggest flaw, (maybe I had missed it but you have to buy the upgrades in the van you call, and they are hidden in the back of each weapon)\n\nThe driving is not able to upgrade until later in the game for some reason, could had been available much earlier in the game. Additionally, there is always something at every turn, which ruins some epic moments that could have been.\n\nCould it have been better? Yes. The missions lack variation and creativity (example: there are very few missions in the water even though you have the ability to swim and dive boats).\n\nBut in my honest opinion, this game is a good addition to any steam deck owner who likes a good story, 60s music and doesn't mind a 3rd person shooter/Driving to be about, shooting and driving (If that's the case, COD can be considered repetitive). \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this game? Let's discuss.",

I am not sure if this is because of any mods I have (I am super new to mods/ PC gaming in general), is it possible I have too many? I only have four games downloaded so I doubt it is a storage issue. This has also happened across two different networks so I don't think it is a wifi issue either.

Following various tutorials online, I updated the BIOS time/date, and used a ethernet cable instead of wifi. It kept saying failing but eventually it just worked. Not sure if related.\n\nAnyways, for the most part the SteamDeck is fine. However, when I go from Desktop Mode back to Gaming Mode, about 20-30% of the time, it returns to the \"Select your Language\" screen followed by TimeZone, connecting to WiFi before it logs me back in. It's irritating as if I'm out without WiFi, I am unable to get into my SteamDeck.\n\nI have checked that the OOBE setting is turned off (it is) and there is no steam folder within my /home/ (only a .steam folder). The only things I have installed on the Deck is emulation station (which I use to launch Dolphin and play Pokemon Colosseum), Marvel Rivals and some software from the Discover Store such as ProtonUp-QT, Discord and Google Chrome.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea how to stop it from returning to the \"Select your Language\" screen so often, and what is causing it?",

    "selftext": "Hey i got this week my Steamdeck and tried to run some older games from my childhood. I did run however into Problems playing Tiny Tiger (1999) (Abandonware). \n\nAfter some research managed to Install the Game with Wine and Add it to my Steam Library. When starting the game it gives me the error \"No CD mounted\". \n\nAfter another Research it says use a Programm like Mount anmount ISO which i also tried, but didnt work. other Users said for similar Games to find a No CD Fix or similar which i couldnt find online since the Game isnt rlly popular i guess.\n\nOnly way i could imagine is running a VM with early Windows, but that seems rlly annoying to launch in Gaming Mode. Is there a better way out there to fix this issue ? thx in advance!",

    "selftext": "I have a Steam Deck (LCD one) and a VRR capable monitor. As many others, for the life of me, I can't enable VRR neither in game or desktop mode on Steam Deck. I'm using direct Type-C to Type-C cable, the cable itself is USB4. So, it has to be DP Alt Mode connection. The monitor is somewhat sketchy, Chinese more or less noname one. In the OSD it says it supports Freesync/G-Sync. I wouldn't bother people with this 1000th issue with VRR, if in the same conditions my M1 Pro Macbook didn't work flawlessly. I hook up the laptop with the same cable, same monitor settings - and boom, 3440x1440, VRR 48-180, HDR - all this goodness just works. Can confirm VRR itself works, the monitor has it's refresh counter indicator, which correlates with in-game FPS. So what gives? Is VRR just not possible with Steam Deck on Type-C connection, or am I missing something?",

    "title": "Weird issues with Deck. Games take 20+ seconds to load with Proton and having issues switching update channels",
    "selftext": "Since a couple months ago my games on my Steam Deck LCD take at least 20 seconds to load after starting them. This only happens in games using Proton, even when using the Heroic launcher. Linux native games launch pretty much instantly. After some troubleshooting I realized it was because of a new modem from my ISP. Issue started right around the time I set it up. If I connect my Deck to a mobile hotspot, Proton games launch in 5 seconds or less. I mostly play single player games, but in proton any Internet check takes WAY longer than it should. Halo MCC has become unplayable on my wifi as it takes minutes to get to the title screen and I'm unable to matchmake before it times out. On a hotspot MCC gets to it's title screen in a few seconds. My modem is a Sagecom FAST 5380. With Linux native games and apps everything runs fine. On speed tests in Firefox I get what I'm supposed to be getting and all my other devices have had no issues with this modem.\n\nWhat makes this weirder is I tried to switch to the SteamOS beta to see if that fixes anything. When I switched to beta and restarted, my deck got stuck at the deck logo. All fixes didn't work, from booting from the boot menu, putting it in battery storage and rolling back my steam os version. If I held the \"...\" Button on boot to roll back I would get stuck at a terminal cursor in the top right corner. I had to use the recovery image to reinstall SteamOS while keeping my home directory.\n\nDuring the SteamOS install, after putting in my wifi password and downloading the latest SteamOS my deck got stuck at the boot logo just like before! As a hail Mary I tried booting it with my modem unplugged, and it finally booted fully! As a test I forgot my wifi network on my deck and connected my hotspot to try to switch to the beta channel. Got stuck again, but this time I turned off my hotspot and tried again and it booted. My deck will now no longer switch update channels unless it completely fails to connect to a network after restarting. And of course, my Proton games still take 20+ seconds to start, even on the beta branch...\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything else like this?\nThe only thing I haven't tried yet is wiping my deck's SSD completely and starting fresh. Does anyone know of anything else I could try before I wipe it?",

    "selftext": "I owned the original LCD Deck then upgraded to the OLED. Love both devices but was starting to feel the pinch to upgrade as I was getting tired of running newer games at the lowest settings and hoping for 40 FPS if I’m lucky. Love Steam OS and quick resume is a down right requirement for me at this point. I’ve seen all of the different handheld devices online but haven’t many in person until I saw the Legion Go S with Steam in Best Buy. Slept on it and ultimately bought it the following day.\n\nExperience so far has been great! Using the same resolution as the deck, I’m able to run most games at higher settings and getting almost double the FPS. Combine with lossless scaling and the results are unreal. I picked up Days Gone again, which I was averaging about 30-40 FPS on the deck at medium to low settings. Running natively on the go at high versus medium presets I was averaging 55-60 FPS. Combined with lossless scaling, I was averaging a buttery smooth 100-120 FPS with little input latency. This describes my experience with most of the games in my library.\n\n3 negatives I would definitely call out are. The battery life, the screen and shit track pad on the go. In performance mode, I was averaging maybe an 1.5 hours at best on more demanding games. Screen looks great but nothing beats an OLED screen. I’m not as particular so that wasn’t a big deal for me but having a  larger and VRR screen on the go is a good trade off. Probably the biggest con for me is losing functional trackpads.\n\nOverall I’m very happy with the upgrade. If you can find a good sale I would definitely recommend the Go S. I know there are other options out there for even more $$$ but I wasn’t particularly keen on changing the standard OS on the other devices to Steam OS.",

My only minor complaint is that the right bumper is a little mushy when pushing it down on its far side, but it still works perfectly when pushed from the top. Quick Google search suggests that this is unfortunately a common issue. Battery health looks to be solid at 97%.\n\nI'm new to PC gaming, so I don't have a Steam library yet, but thinking that this could supplement my Switch 2, especially for indies or more obscure titles. \n\nI'm going to pick up Return of Obra Dinn (on sale now), and looking forward to Master Chief Collection (waiting on a sale), Red Dead Redemption 2, and Baldurs Gate 3. Going to give Geforce Now a try at some point as well but hopefully my home internet is capable. \n\nEager to hear from owners of both the Switch 2 + Steam Deck. There's a lot of overlap in the libraries - what are your must have games that aren't available on the Switch? Also, would appreciate hearing your advice on whether I should apply a screen protector on top of the etched glass/anti-glare screen.\n\nCheers!",

    "title": "What I'm trying to play as I die: A somewhat update!",
    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI hope you are all well and enjoying your decks! \n\nI wasn't too sure if I should do this update, I have been getting much weaker as the weeks and days go by and gaming of any kind has become almost impossible it feels. I struggle to play more than an hour but I do try! I am finding myself losing weight faster than ever before, my strength has all but gone, and I struggle greatly with nausea so much even as I try to write this I am having to take breaks, so just please understand that ALL I want to do is chat and play with all of you, I would love to do nothing more but its becoming harder and harder. \n\nEven then we still GAME ON! I have been bedridden so much that watching movies and tv shows is something I can do much easier, so maybe you could drop your fave tv shows and films as well as games!\n\nand lastly before the review, I wondered if it would be worthwhile creating a discord server, where anyone who's bothered could come by and chat, hang out, etc. If you think it could be a good idea, let me know!\n\nDying Light: The Beast - WOW! When I first remember playing Dying Light 1, I was truly blown away, it felt like what I always wanted Dead Island to be, this ultra realistic zombie game, and it just delivered on every level, it made zombies SCARY again, you can't fight hordes, 3 or 4 is a decent battle, the night was scary and the Stalkers! wow. Then came 2, and whilst it developed on every element from the first game, it somehow, mistreated them. \n\nNight was no longer scary, the traversal didn't feel as fun, and it just felt TOO BIG, a bit BLOATED, and I didn't care like I did in 1. So, when Dying Light - The Beast was announced, I actually wasn't too excited, but once it launched all I heard was good things, now I have only played around 4 hours  but those were some of the most exciting, thrilling and scary hours of gaming in a LONG time. The graphics are sublime, the gore, the combat, traversal, it is all for me..perfect in every single way. If you loved 1, then this will be your perfect new zombie game, if you felt let down by 2, this is the game to revitalise that love of killing zombies. \n\nSilent Hill f - Whilst I have only started, it is only my second foray into the Silent Hill world. Now I LOVE Halloween, and I find dev's filmmakers, anyone really when it comes to Horror, they kinda throw in a few jump scares and say \"It's a scary game\" so I love when a game is fully fleshed out, the in's and out's, the themes, the pure scariness! Well, I have pretty much switched Silent Hill f straight off, like right click and close window, because it's CREEPY. The sound design is incredible, and just makes the entire world far more scary. I am still only just pulling back the cover but I am loving it!\n\nI HOPE to be somewhat better soon where I can at least play some games, or just feel like I can exist for a few hours. I always want to be honest with all of you, and the fact is depression is something I have fought with help from my family, but the last few weeks, I have just felt lower, and lower. Everyday is harder, and I am struggling more than ever. I have support, I have people, but there's an finality setting in, an understanding that my mum can't just be a MUM and fix this, I think maybe it is all catching up to me. \n\nThank you once again for taking your time to read this and being apart of this journey, I apologise for the gap between these posts but I am just shedding weight, I look in the mirror and I don't know who I see, for the first time I looked at myself and truly admitted. \"I am sick, this is it\". It has been tough, but whenever I have felt down either Reddit or Steam will ping and someone will be checking in, someone will be seeing how I am, and that..that really keeps me going. So each and everyone of you mean the world to me. \n\n  \nI hope more than anything to continue my silly updates, we have a new Football manager coming out, Outer worlds 2! Vampire: Masquerade 2! and that just a few amazing experiences that I hold on to, seeing my family everyday, speaking with you all, and looking forward to games, that's a core of my push each day and it works so far :')\n\nOnce again, thank you for taking time to read this, and I hope to hear from you all. \n\nAdd me on Steam anytime! 82871772\n\nAnd if you fancy joining my Discord server, so we have somewhere to chat - https://discord.gg/TjRhH2Ye\n\nM",

It has been there through sickness, injury recovery, boredom, etc.  I’ve got hundreds of hours of gaming on it, and look forward to hundreds more.  I’ve picked up 106 games for it since I took it out of the box, and currently have 89 games installed on it.  (Essentially every game I haven’t finished yet.)  I’ve still got over 220GB available in case anything else pops up that I can’t live without.  I hope everybody else gets as much enjoyment from theirs as I get from mine.

My only minor complaint is that the right bumper is a little mushy when pushing it down on its far side, but it still works perfectly when pushed from the top. Quick Google search suggests that this is unfortunately a common issue. Battery health looks to be solid at 97%.\n\nI'm new to PC gaming, so I don't have a Steam library yet, but thinking that this could supplement my Switch 2, especially for indies or more obscure titles. \n\nI'm going to pick up Return of Obra Dinn (on sale now), and looking forward to Master Chief Collection (waiting on a sale), Red Dead Redemption 2, and Baldurs Gate 3. Going to give Geforce Now a try at some point as well but hopefully my home internet is capable. \n\nEager to hear from owners of both the Switch 2 + Steam Deck. There's a lot of overlap in the libraries - what are your must have games that aren't available on the Switch? Also, would appreciate hearing your advice on whether I should apply a screen protector on top of the etched glass/anti-glare screen.\n\nCheers!",

Which brings me to the point of not being able to afford a gaming PC right now. I say this to say I'm nervous/timid about reaching out to a guild to join seeing as how I only play on steam deck and can't really create my own guild as I have no other friends who play WoW, they're all console gamers or those couple I have that have a steam deck aren't into WoW. Just looking for some advice here. Anyone have a guild that's open to a strictly steam deck player or any interested in creating a steam deck WoW guild haha. But seriously any advice/direction is much appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "This is a bit of a love letter, but whatever, thats what this sub is also about right?\nSo we can (and do) rave about the screen, storage, pricing, specs etc etc etc. \nHowever some of those things are not mutually exclusive to the Steam Deck and everyone can do that. I also don't want to mention the SteamOS, because whilst brilliant, its not a detail but a core part of the experience. \n\n\nNo, I want to mention some details that for me push the Steamdeck to S tier status\n\n- the length of the charging cable. Its a lonnggg boy. this may seem like a no brainer, but the charger itself is not particularly powerful and a standard USB C cable would've worked just as well to charge the deck. But now I can hang around on the couch with the deck plugged in and not be constrained by the cable. Sure, other handhelds in the past have had long cables but they always bugged me with power bricks in the middle or weird proprietary connectors\n\n\n-The haptic touchpads on either side. These provide so much extra utility that no other handheld has. They are not needed for most games, but they are there and they work for the games that do benefit from them.\n\n\n-In the same guise; the rear 4 buttons. For most games you don't need them but you can still configure them for extra stuff and it really makes some more keyboard heavy games so much better to play. \n\n-repairability. In an era of sealed and glued everything its good to see a company make their machines repairable. This is not strictly needed nor do a lot of consumers really care but still they did it.\n\n\nThe Steam deck would've functioned almost as well without these features. In fact, the competition (legion, msi, asus) don't have stuff like the touchpads and they also work. But they are here and they elevate the experience from A to S tier for me.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI hope you are all well and enjoying your decks! \n\nI wasn't too sure if I should do this update, I have been getting much weaker as the weeks and days go by and gaming of any kind has become almost impossible it feels. I struggle to play more than an hour but I do try! I am finding myself losing weight faster than ever before, my strength has all but gone, and I struggle greatly with nausea so much even as I try to write this I am having to take breaks, so just please understand that ALL I want to do is chat and play with all of you, I would love to do nothing more but its becoming harder and harder. \n\nEven then we still GAME ON! I have been bedridden so much that watching movies and tv shows is something I can do much easier, so maybe you could drop your fave tv shows and films as well as games!\n\nand lastly before the review, I wondered if it would be worthwhile creating a discord server, where anyone who's bothered could come by and chat, hang out, etc. If you think it could be a good idea, let me know!\n\nDying Light: The Beast - WOW! When I first remember playing Dying Light 1, I was truly blown away, it felt like what I always wanted Dead Island to be, this ultra realistic zombie game, and it just delivered on every level, it made zombies SCARY again, you can't fight hordes, 3 or 4 is a decent battle, the night was scary and the Stalkers! wow. Then came 2, and whilst it developed on every element from the first game, it somehow, mistreated them. \n\nNight was no longer scary, the traversal didn't feel as fun, and it just felt TOO BIG, a bit BLOATED, and I didn't care like I did in 1. So, when Dying Light - The Beast was announced, I actually wasn't too excited, but once it launched all I heard was good things, now I have only played around 4 hours  but those were some of the most exciting, thrilling and scary hours of gaming in a LONG time. The graphics are sublime, the gore, the combat, traversal, it is all for me..perfect in every single way. If you loved 1, then this will be your perfect new zombie game, if you felt let down by 2, this is the game to revitalise that love of killing zombies. \n\nSilent Hill f - Whilst I have only started, it is only my second foray into the Silent Hill world. Now I LOVE Halloween, and I find dev's filmmakers, anyone really when it comes to Horror, they kinda throw in a few jump scares and say \"It's a scary game\" so I love when a game is fully fleshed out, the in's and out's, the themes, the pure scariness! Well, I have pretty much switched Silent Hill f straight off, like right click and close window, because it's CREEPY. The sound design is incredible, and just makes the entire world far more scary. I am still only just pulling back the cover but I am loving it!\n\nI HOPE to be somewhat better soon where I can at least play some games, or just feel like I can exist for a few hours. I always want to be honest with all of you, and the fact is depression is something I have fought with help from my family, but the last few weeks, I have just felt lower, and lower. Everyday is harder, and I am struggling more than ever. I have support, I have people, but there's an finality setting in, an understanding that my mum can't just be a MUM and fix this, I think maybe it is all catching up to me. \n\nThank you once again for taking your time to read this and being apart of this journey, I apologise for the gap between these posts but I am just shedding weight, I look in the mirror and I don't know who I see, for the first time I looked at myself and truly admitted. \"I am sick, this is it\". It has been tough, but whenever I have felt down either Reddit or Steam will ping and someone will be checking in, someone will be seeing how I am, and that..that really keeps me going. So each and everyone of you mean the world to me. \n\n  \nI hope more than anything to continue my silly updates, we have a new Football manager coming out, Outer worlds 2! Vampire: Masquerade 2! and that just a few amazing experiences that I hold on to, seeing my family everyday, speaking with you all, and looking forward to games, that's a core of my push each day and it works so far :')\n\nOnce again, thank you for taking time to read this, and I hope to hear from you all. \n\nAdd me on Steam anytime! 82871772\n\nAnd if you fancy joining my Discord server, so we have somewhere to chat - https://discord.gg/TjRhH2Ye\n\nM",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI know this is old news for everyone here, but still wanted to share my excitement. I picked up this used 512gb LCD Deck on a whim off Marketplace for $250 USD. My only minor complaint is that the right bumper is a little mushy when pushing it down on its far side, but it still works perfectly when pushed from the top. Quick Google search suggests that this is unfortunately a common issue. Battery health looks to be solid at 97%.\n\nI'm new to PC gaming, so I don't have a Steam library yet, but thinking that this could supplement my Switch 2, especially for indies or more obscure titles. \n\nI'm going to pick up Return of Obra Dinn (on sale now), and looking forward to Master Chief Collection (waiting on a sale), Red Dead Redemption 2, and Baldurs Gate 3. Going to give Geforce Now a try at some point as well but hopefully my home internet is capable. \n\nEager to hear from owners of both the Switch 2 + Steam Deck. There's a lot of overlap in the libraries - what are your must have games that aren't available on the Switch? Also, would appreciate hearing your advice on whether I should apply a screen protector on top of the etched glass/anti-glare screen.\n\nCheers!",

The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather).

I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

The one take away from my Wink experience was local control. When Wink went down or the internet went down, nothing worked.

I have changed and rewired the house for many new devices to get to this goal. My dilemma is table side lamps. I need to be able to have Hubitat control as well as the normal turn the knob on the lamp socket control. I have scoured the internet looking for solutions and it seems none exist.

Right now, there’s an old intercom system that lets me talk to visitors and open the gate remotely from inside the house. The gate lock uses an electric strike (if that’s the right term).\n\nI’d like to replace the current system with a smart doorbell that has a camera and allows remote access (via app). Power is already available at the gate, and the electric strike works fine.\n\nMy idea was to install a mobile LTE/5G router at the gate to provide Wi-Fi there and then use a device like Ring or a similar system for the video doorbell.\n\nMy questions:\n\t•\tWould you approach this differently?\n\t•\tAny recommendations for specific brands or systems?\n\t•\tCan a system like Ring, Nuki (or similar) actually control an electric strike, or would I need a different setup for that part?\n\t•\tIdeally, I’d like one provider for both the gate doorbell and a smart doorbell/lock at the main house door, to keep everything within one ecosystem, or do you think that having different systems does not make a huge difference?\n\nThanks a lot for any tips or setups that worked well for you!",

    "selftext": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI'd like to share my open-source project **Proxmox-GitOps**, a Container Automation platform for provisioning and orchestrating Linux containers (LXC) on Proxmox VE - encapsulated as comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC).\n\n**Proxmox-GitOps (@Github)**: [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps)\n \n* **Demo** (~1m): [https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY](https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY)\n\n* **Demo** (low, no ads): [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif)\n\n\n**TL;DR**: By encapsulating infrastructure within an extensible monorepository - recursively resolved from Git submodules at runtime - Proxmox-GitOps provides a comprehensive Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) abstraction for an entire, automated, container-based infrastructure.\n\nOriginally, it was a personal attempt to bring industrial automation and cloud patterns to my Proxmox home server. It's designed as a platform architecture for a self-contained, bootstrappable system - a generic IaC abstraction (customize, extend, .. open standards, base package only, .. - you name it 😉) that automates the entire infrastructure. It was initially driven by the question of what a Proxmox-based GitOps automation could look like and how it could be organized.\n\n**Core Concepts**\n\n* **Recursive Self-management**: Control plane seeds itself by pushing its monorepository onto a locally bootstrapped instance, triggering a pipeline that recursively provisions the control plane onto PVE.\n\n* **Monorepository**: Centralizes infrastructure as comprehensive IaC artifact (for mirroring, like the project itself on Github) using submodules for modular composition.\n\n* **Git as State**: Git repository represents the desired infrastructure state.\n\n* **Loose coupling**: Containers are decoupled from the control plane, enabling runtime replacement and independent operation.\n\nOver the past few months, the project stabilized, and I’ve addressed many questions you had in Wiki, summarized to documentation, which should now covers essential technical, conceptual, and practical aspects. I’ve also added a short demo that breaks down the theory by demonstrating the automation of an IaC stack (Home Assistant, Mosquitto bridge, Zigbee2MQTT broker, snapshot restore, reverse proxy, dynamically configured via PVE API), with automated container system updates and service checks.\n\n**What am I looking for?** It's a noncommercial, passion-driven project. I'm looking to collaborate with other engineers who share the excitement of building a self-contained, bootstrappable platform architecture that addresses the question: What should our home automation look like?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts!",

Coupled with an esp8266, it's let me keep track of stove temperatures and helped optimize burns (when to cut back primary air, when to reload, etc). As a result, last week when I cleaned the chimney for the season, I had virtually no creosote build up.  I had set up some simple notifications to our phones like over fire when temp > 800F and reload when temp < 250F, but it was a bit of a pain to pull my phone out throughout the night to keep tabs on the stove. Tonight, I mapped the temperature reading to a hue value on the hue/sat color wheel and setup an automation to gradually adjust a virtually unused wyze color bulb in the corner for a visual stove temperature indication. After burn #1 with it in place, I'm pretty satisfied! Blue = cold, green = target, red = hot. With the hue mapping, color gradually adjusts every 30s in small increments throughout the burn.\n\n  \nFull write up here: [https://houndhillhomestead.com/smart-light-wood-stove-temperature-indication/](https://houndhillhomestead.com/smart-light-wood-stove-temperature-indication/)\n\nAnd original stove monitoring write up here: [https://houndhillhomestead.com/woodstove-temperature-monitoring/](https://houndhillhomestead.com/woodstove-temperature-monitoring/)",

    "title": "My impression of SmartWings shades",
    "selftext": "The other day I got into a convo wth another Redditor who asked in this sub some specifics about SmartWings shades. I bought some earlier this year for a couple of the bedrooms and then installed a set in my home office yesterday, so I thought I would write a longer review.\n\nMy smarthome setup consists of Google Home, a Hubitat hub, and primarily Z-Wave Plus products. All of my SmartWings shades have Z-Wave Plus motors. In the bedrooms I installed 90% blackout Zebra shades. Yesterday I installed a 70% blackout woven wood roller shade in my home office.\n\nWhen ordering there's a good bit of information to fill in and a number of choices to make, so be sure to allow yourself a sufficient block of time. The fabric colors are clearly outlined but it's not always easy to make a proper comparison from a PC or phone. You can order a book of fabric samples, which I did prior to placing my second order.\n\nThe measuring instructions are clear and there's no need to overcompensate for anything. I added the minimum suggested amount to the window length and the side blackout works great. For the Zebra shade height I overcompensated and ended up having to mount the Zebra shades higher than originally planned because the bedroom window sills jut out a bit. The Zebra shades have to be mounted at an exact height so that the fabric lines up correctly when the shade is fully closed.  If there's no obstruction like a window sill then that won't really matter, but in my case it did and I measured too long, That was user error on my part. Just measure the window height and add the suggested amount for the mounts. There's no need to add any length past that.\n\nShipping takes a few weeks since they come from China. Once the order is marked as in transit, the shipment arrives within a few days.\n\nInstallation is easy, unless you measure too long like I did. :D There are a handful of brackets to install for the Zebra shades, and if you order an outside mount like I did, there are extenders to install as well. The woven wood shade that I ordered recently is even easier to install, with brackets only and a top-down connection. I recommend having an installation buddy for any blind wider than a single window. The blinds aren't heavy but if lengthy they can be unwieldy to hold solo.\n\nConnecting to the home network is easy, requiring only the app for your hub and the appropriate PIN or ID for the device.\n\nI didn't get the solar chargers on any of the blinds, figuring I would just charge them as needed. Thus far I've only had to charge the bedroom blinds twice in 8 months. \n\nI've been highly satisfied with the blinds in the bedrooms, and the newly installed woven wood shade in my office is working great as well.  These blinds are on the pricier side but the quality is excellent and the setup is easy.\n\nOne other note: at first I was using my ADT alarm system as the hub and not Hubitat.  Google Home wouldn't recognize the blinds even though they had been added to ADT successfully. Of ADT, Google, and SmartWings, only the SmartWings customer service rep seemed to have any clue a to what was going on. ADT's response was \"sorry we don't sell that product so I can't help you.\" Google customer support told me to disconnect and reconnect ADT even though I plainly told them that I'd already tried that, and when it still didn't work they said \"oh that's too bad thanks bye.\" Ha. The SmartWings chat rep listened to what was going on and correctly suspected that the ADT controller wasn't properly communicating the presence of the blinds with Google Home. They recommended that I switch my hub to either Google Hub or one of their other supported hubs. I went with Hubitat and now it all works great.\n\nBottom line, SmartWings are solid and easy to set up smart blinds.",

    "title": "How to Design a System for my Home?",
    "selftext": "Hello, I’m under contract for a new home and will gain access in a couple of weeks. I’m feeling a tiny bit overwhelmed. I have what I would consider above average tech skills. I’m a software engineer by trade writing web apps, and I first learned to code on Arduino over a decade ago so I have decent programming and cursory electronics skills (I could install a WiFi relay or something of similar complexity without help). I used to have my whole place set up with WiFi bulbs and a WiFi thermostat connected to google home and do enjoy the benefits of smart home features (though WiFi bulbs were kind of a pain and I’m excited to control things at the switch instead). \n\nI’m interested in designing a home automation system throughout the home that far exceeds what I’ve been able to do previously as a renter. Part of that means I want to set up a network rack and run cat 6 cabling throughout the house. I want to make good choices early so I don’t have to upgrade later, but I’m having trouble deciding what that means for my project. \n\nThe house is a 4 story townhome in the the middle of a city so I do want some cameras and security features, but I don’t have a yard, just a 1 car garage. I think maybe having PoE run everywhere is the right way to do it? I have a little bit of an attention deficit and replacing batteries in a bunch of devices is a hassle. \n\nI also need a little advice on how to figure out what’s already been set up, the house has a Bluetooth speaker system throughout, and there were some digital intercom screens set up in a few rooms but they appeared to be turned off we did the tour/inspection. \n\nThere’s also the matter of hardware and software choices. I’ve heard great things about the unifi ubiquiti platform and would like to try a nice network setup as a backbone for the project, and I’m excited to build on an open sourced platform like home assistant. I tried having a conversation with an LLM about hardware and some things like a dedicated firewall seem like overkill? It’s tough to right size a system without having seen common setups before.\n\nAll of these variables have led me into a bit of an analysis paralysis, I wanted to start home lab-ing a bit in preparation but can’t decide what parts of the project I can get a head start on or if I should just wait to get the keys. I feel if I wait too long to run the cat6 I might have to do it after our stuff is moved in making things a little harder (I have a month and a half or so of overlap to move), but I figure getting someone out here to do the work twice will cost more so I should figure out how many ports I’m going to have them drop quickly. \n\nMostly just looking for general advice, tips, or other experiences to learn from on how to properly design and diagram everything and come up with a semblance of a plan going into the new home. Help!",

    "selftext": "So I recently discovered the Anki Vector Robot on TikTok, and I’ve been fascinated ever since. He’s this tiny AI companion that can tell the weather, take photos, roll dice, and even deal blackjack. When connected to Alexa, he can also handle smart home tasks like controlling lights or adding things to your shopping list. It’s wild how much personality they packed into such a small device. What I love most is how interactive he seems. You can say, “Hey Vector, I have a question,” and he’ll actually think before answering, kind of like a miniature voice assistant with a face. He also reacts when you touch or move him, thanks to built-in sensors that make him feel almost alive. Pet him, and he relaxes; shake him, and he gets grumpy (which, fair enough). The only concern I’ve found is that the original company, Anki, went out of business, so some features now rely on third-party servers like Wire Pod to stay functional. Still, the charm is undeniable. If you’re shopping around, I noticed the Anki Vector Robot is available on Alibaba at much more reasonable prices than Amazon’s listings. Anyone here using Vector lately, does he still live up to the hype? Edit: Reposted ",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I’ve come across a Yale Conexis L1 for sale brand new I box for £70 or around $90 close by. I’ve just done some research and found the Yale app has been discontinued and it’ll only works with the Access Module and a new app which is a further £70 on the Yale website. \n\nI was wondering if you guys thought it was a worthwhile purchase being they the product is obviously an older model now. I still can’t find an L2 under £250/300 so it’s a big discount.\n\nI originally heard the L2 was an L1 with the module built it but now I’m seeing reviews saying it’s improved all round. \n\nI’d appreciate thoughts!",

    "selftext": "I’m planning to install **9 motorised roller blinds** around my home, and I’m weighing my options between **Somfy** or **Cruze** (I believe Cruze is be a white-label Somfy product). \n\nInitially, I intended to go with **hardwired roller motors**, but an electrician friend warned that retrofitting wiring in my house would be extremely difficult due to its construction. So now I’m seriously considering **battery-powered motors**, but I have a few concerns:\n\n\n\n# My Concerns\n\n* **Frequent charging** Each blind will be about **265 cm wide × 200 cm drop**, made from a PVC easy-wipe fabric. Will the motors struggle with the weight and will I end up constantly recharging?\n* **Battery degradation over time** Even if they're fine day one, batteries degrade. Will I regret batteries?\n* **Availability & cost of replacement batteries** If the batteries fail in, say, 5 years, can I still get replacements? Or do I risk the motors being obsolete?\n* **Reliability vs simplicity** I’m also drawn to RTS for its simplicity - is it more “bulletproof” than newer Zigbee alternatives?\n\n\n\nI’ve tried looking for first hand user experiences, but i'm struggling, especially for big, heavy blinds like mine.\n\nSo I’d love to hear from those who have these types of systems:\n\n* How do battery-powered Somfy motors hold up over the years?\n* Any regrets about going battery instead of wiring when possible?\n* How is RTS in day to day use - stable, reliable?\n* Cruze users (if you’re out there) how do your blinds stack up?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Mainly they're only lockable (reliably) from the inside / manually. The motor sounds like it is locking when you push the lock button, but it doesn't actually lock (even with fresh batteries). The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather). The fingerprint access is the reason I bought them at the time, and it rarely works (even when I reprogram the lock, it forgets my prints in a week or two). I will not buy another Utec and when I searched the group that's what people recommended.  \nWe are looking for a deadbolt replacement lock (no handle / knob needed) that has fingerprint and bluetooth (no wifi). Any secure ones out there that are resistant to drilling? If we had to go with no bluetooth, that would be fine too. Thanks in advance.",

I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this).

In the past I tried to do this with Amazon Ring doorbell camera and Fire TV.  By the time I could see the door video on the TV I could have gotten up and answered the door, twice… three times!  In short, it was so slow as to be useless.  Hopefully, HomeKit can do better.\n\nI am considering getting Homey or Home Assistant - I don’t know if that would help with speed.  It would be okay if the camera is separate from the doorbell.  I just want it to connect fast enough to be useful.  I am open to anything that solves this problem.  Moving in December so there is time to shop Black Friday sales and even change the mesh devices or other devices.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI'm trying to set up my Yeelight bulb and keep getting stuck at the same point. The app fails during the \"Connect to device\" step with the error: \"Connecting to network timed out - Bring phone closer to device and try again\"\nWhat I've already tried:\n\nPhone is literally inches away from the bulb during setup\nConnected to 2.4GHz network only (confirmed in router settings)\nWiFi password has no special characters\nReset the bulb multiple times (5+ power cycles until it blinks)\nReinstalled the Yeelight app\nTurned off mobile data and VPN\nRouter has strong signal where the bulb is located\nTried setup at different times of day\n\nMy setup:\n\nBulb model: Mi Smart LED Bulb Essential (White and Color) - Model: MJDPL01YL\nPhone: iPhone (iOS)\nRouter: 2.4GHz enabled, WPA2 security\nApp: Latest version from App Store\n\nHere's the weird part: I also have a Yeelight LED (YLDP02YL - the older color version) that I set up successfully with the same network, same phone, same app. That one connected without any issues. So I know my setup works in general, but this specific bulb just won't connect.\nThe bulb powers on fine and goes into pairing mode (blinking), but it times out every single time at the network connection step.\nHas anyone else dealt with this timeout error on the Essential model specifically? Any ideas why one bulb would work fine but the other won't? Thanks in advance for any help!",

The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather).

    "selftext": "My home has a two-gang box w/ two switches on the living room wall, and whatever used to be hooked up to one of the switches was disconnected before I bought it. We mostly use lamps with Hue bulbs in this room and I thought I could replace that dead switch with a remote to toggle a scene in my HomeKit setup instead of futzing with phones or assistants.\n\nThe Hue dimmer does what I want _technically_ but I would love something that fits behind a Decora plate. The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

Any reviews from anyone using these in their home ? \n\nLink provided in case you’re are curious.

Obviously I don’t want to sever power from the bulbs.\n\nI’ve searched a variety of different sensor switches, stand-alone PIR motion sensors, etc but can’t get to a confident decision on how to handle this.  I’m open to the possibility of using stand alone (small footprint) sensors to achieve an automation via homeassistant but I’d like to do it as simply as possible while still having a physical switch to activate the smart LED fixtures. \n\nI’m open to ideas",

    "selftext": "Is or has anyone else thought about doing this? Has anyone done it successfully? \n\nI'd like parts of my home to have lights turn on ONLY when there is a person detected. Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

Something bright but it doesn't have to be crazy. RGB isn't necessary but I did enjoy switching to red lights whenever I felt overstimulated. ㅤNeed 4. \n\nI loved the simple operation of the Sengled bulbs being controlled from my phone with Google Assistant or through the app. \n\n2. Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up? Something without a subscription.\n\n  \nAdded request - We're using a really old camera system. I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription. I don't live in the US and spending USD adds up really quick with forex limits.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nPS.

Sounds great on paper but which entry method do you actually use daily.\n\nI have a basic single deadbolt on a wood door. I host family and a dog sitter so I want to stop hiding keys. I was eyeing August or Schlage but brand does not matter. I just need it to work when it is snowing.\n\nHow reliable are fingerprints with cold dry hands. Are keypads quicker in real life. Is a fob handy or just another thing to lose.\n\nDo I need a hub for WiFi or does the router handle it. For Thread I think you need a hub too, does a HomePod Mini count.\n\nWhat worked for you for auto lock timing, battery life, and guest codes. Any install gotchas for a first timer.",

I thought maybe the ecobee would work, but upon further investigation It looks like its a high voltage system. There's no c-wire in the system. \n\nAre there any options out there, or am I screwed without an electrician. We're looking into getting heat pumps, but we're in a part of the world where it's getting cold quickly and oil is hella expensive so it'd be nice to conserve it as best I can with a smart thermostat. \n\nSorry if these are all dumb questions.

My current boiler is wired up differently however.\n\nThe first picture is the default setup. The white wire in the trunking is Live In. The white on the left goes in to the relay (to trigger the central heating), and the white on the right goes from the relay to the boiler. The Black is permanent live to the boiler for hot water.\n\nThe second picture is using WAGO connecters instead of the standard connector, hot water works fine.\n\nThe third picture shows how the relay is wired (there's a piece that plugs in to connect and control). My assumption was that I could just swap that Live/Neutral on the left to the inputs on the ZBMINIR2, and then the Live/Neutral on the right to the outputs, and everything should work.\n\nWith just the inputs, the ZBMINIR2 'works' fine, in that I can see it and toggle it in HomeAssistant. However the issue is that whenever I power the boiler on with the outputs connected, my RCD trips instantly.\n\n  \nHoping for some advice on what I'm doing wrong, because I am perplexed.",

Now, we have moved to a bigger house and plan to buy a smart ceiling lamp, in additional to more bulbs.\n\nInitially the plan was to buy Philips Hue Enrave M, but then we realised Wiz is also made by Signify and started considering WiZ SuperSlim -kattovalaisin 22W 2700-6500K RGB, which on paper is brighter than the enrave M. In the future we will also switch to HomePod instead of Alexa, so they will be controlled through Matter (if I understood correctly). Plus, we would like to buy the motion sensor devices, but still unsure where to use them. Currently the Philips bulbs are in the bedrooms and kitchen, while the ceiling lamp would go to living room (which is an open space extending from the kitchen)\n\nI have researched reviews and don't find major differences between Hue and Wiz. Reviews of Wiz are also generally quite positive, and I am trying to understand what would justify the difference in price. Here where I live, Wiz costs 65€ and Philips around 120€ (both discounted this week, so need to make a decision asap)",

Circles represent lights, split into circuits that I’ve colour coded. \n\nWhen I leave for work, it’s dark, and I currently have to turn on and off about a million switches to light my way to the front door. \n\nWhat i would like is an extra switch next to ‘Green Circuit Switch 2’ that turns on and off ALL the lights between the kitchen and the front door. I would like another extra switch next to ‘Blue Circuit Switch 1’ that does the same. \n\nI still want to be able to control each circuit separately too. \n\nI have a WiFi mesh system that supports Matter. I also have a Tapo hub and a NAS running home assistant. I’m planning to get an Apple TV at some point too. \n\nI don’t mind setting up automations but i want physical switches rather than PIR triggered lights. \n\nI think I need a combination of smart switches and relays?  Like, a smart switch at each far end, combined with a smart relay hidden behind the regular lighting panels of the other circuits. And when I hit either of the smart switches, the relays are all automated to turn on or off. \n\nIs that right?! What’s the best way to run such an automation? Or is there a better solution?\n\nThank you!\n",

Either by linking a smart button to existing Google Home routines, or faking a voice command through a button press?\n\nAny tips or product recommendations (that work well in Europe/Sweden) are much appreciated!",

Other circuits run through tight electrical boxes, and won't accomodate larger standard ZWave or Zigbee switches like Jasco/GE/Enbrighten. Lutron Caseta doesn't fit the aesthetic of this old Victorian. This is new territory for me, so I am looking at the Sonoff units like the one below.  \n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYNRF8GV?ref=ppx\\_yo2ov\\_dt\\_b\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYNRF8GV?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)\n\nI am using Home Assistant now - I been using SmartThings from Samsung/Aeotek for 10 years.  I ordered the Sonoff Pro Hub just in case I need it, but I'd rather integrate directly with HA. My Home Assistant Green has both Zigbee and Zwave plug ins already installed and working.\n\nI'd love to hear from some folks with similar setups and their experiences with them. This is a larger house, and there are probably 14 light circuits that I would like to control.\n\nTIA",

If we just tell the light to always be \"on\" and bypass the switch, then there needs to be some type of centralised server on the LAN that tells light X to turn on when Y button or Z motion detection is triggered, which is a central point of failure.\n\nIs there a solution, where the light temperature, brightness and color can be controlled via a smart home system, but the wall switch itself communicates directly with the light, issuing it commands, like turn on, dim to 50% etc?\n\nThis sounds like something Matter and Thread were trying to solve.\n\nI obviously want to be able to cut power to the light socket itself via the switch with a manual override too in case I ever need to touch the wiring.\n\nIf the solution already exists, can anyone point to some hardware?",

It took some time, but I’ve decided it’s time to overhaul everything; desk, chairs, blackboard, and, most importantly, my bed. After long nights of work and countless tabs open, comfort has become non-negotiable.\n\nAnd that’s how I stumbled onto the concept of the Smart Bed. Adjustable firmness, sleep tracking, temperature control; the features sound straight out of a sci-fi film. Getting one now feels more possible than ever with all the online options available. My friend even helped me look through various designs on Alibaba and we were able to narrow it down to 2 peculiar interests. \n\nBut here’s the catch: while money isn’t the issue, I can’t shake off this nagging thought. Shouldn’t my late-night hours be a sanctuary away from screens and tech? Am I inviting more distractions into a space that should balance work and rest?\n\nPart of me is excited about the upgrade, but another part feels skeptical. Will a smart bed genuinely improve my life, or is it just a shiny gadget I don’t really need?\n\nSo please, I’d love your take. Do you own a smart bed? Is it worth the hype, or should I stick to a traditional high-quality mattress? What are the hidden pros and cons no one talks about?",

Same for roller shutters - like “close 90%” per window, or close/open all to X% buttons.\n\nI read that **Home Assistant** seems the best - open source, very flexible. But **BTicino** looks tricky to connect with HA or other systems. So I’m wondering: what’s the **best setup**, which brands are worth checking for each type of device, and should I go **wired** or use with Wi-Fi/local network?\n\nThe apartment is quite big, so Wi-Fi might not reach the other side. Maybe I’ll need **two routers or access points** with seamless roaming, but I’m not sure what’s best.\n\nI’m a software developer, so I can handle APIs and automations, but I’ve never done a home setup.

    "selftext": "My home has a two-gang box w/ two switches on the living room wall, and whatever used to be hooked up to one of the switches was disconnected before I bought it. We mostly use lamps with Hue bulbs in this room and I thought I could replace that dead switch with a remote to toggle a scene in my HomeKit setup instead of futzing with phones or assistants.\n\nThe Hue dimmer does what I want _technically_ but I would love something that fits behind a Decora plate. The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

I saw that the company shut down or something like that. I have zero interest in any complicated set ups to make it work again so I'm looking to replace them. What are some good budget replacements? Something bright but it doesn't have to be crazy. RGB isn't necessary but I did enjoy switching to red lights whenever I felt overstimulated. ㅤNeed 4. \n\nI loved the simple operation of the Sengled bulbs being controlled from my phone with Google Assistant or through the app. \n\n2. Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up? Something without a subscription.\n\n  \nAdded request - We're using a really old camera system. I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription. I don't live in the US and spending USD adds up really quick with forex limits.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nPS. If there's a better community for me to ask these things, feel free to scold me and send me on my way.",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nin our house we have used so far Philips bulbs and nothing more than Alexa to switch them on and off and change intensity. Now, we have moved to a bigger house and plan to buy a smart ceiling lamp, in additional to more bulbs.\n\nInitially the plan was to buy Philips Hue Enrave M, but then we realised Wiz is also made by Signify and started considering WiZ SuperSlim -kattovalaisin 22W 2700-6500K RGB, which on paper is brighter than the enrave M. In the future we will also switch to HomePod instead of Alexa, so they will be controlled through Matter (if I understood correctly). Plus, we would like to buy the motion sensor devices, but still unsure where to use them. Currently the Philips bulbs are in the bedrooms and kitchen, while the ceiling lamp would go to living room (which is an open space extending from the kitchen)\n\nI have researched reviews and don't find major differences between Hue and Wiz. Reviews of Wiz are also generally quite positive, and I am trying to understand what would justify the difference in price. Here where I live, Wiz costs 65€ and Philips around 120€ (both discounted this week, so need to make a decision asap)",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI have several ceiling spotlights in the hallway of our apartment, which are controlled by a total of three light switches. Since it would be too expensive for me to replace all the switches with smart ones (especially because I have the same problem in other parts of the apartment), and since it’s also not possible for me to replace the ceiling spots themselves, I’m looking for a way to integrate them into my Home Assistant system.\n\nThe light switches are configured in a multi-way (intermediate) circuit.\n\nDoes it make sense — or is it even possible — to replace only one of the switches in this setup, or would that not work? Are there any other options I might not have considered?\n\nI hope everything is understandable :D I am not a native speaker.\n\nThank you in advance guys!\n\n  \nEDIT1: I it is a Intermediate switching/4-way switch circuit",

It has physical stop settings, so the risk of overtravel is limited as long as those don't fail, but the motor switch is 3-position.\n\nIt's not 3-way: it's 3-position, that is, the up position goes clockwise, down goes counter-clockwise, and there's a middle neutral position that is off. A switch like that would have to have a very specific \"on\" time. Like, I should be able to tell it how long it takes to extend fully and program that time in seconds.\n\n  \nIs there any product that works well and integrates with the typical smart home hubs that would work? Right now, we have and really like Hue hub for our exterior lights and a way to hook this up to Hue would be awesome. What I'd like to avoid is another Wi-Fi-based switch with a proprietary app. I am pretty handy, but a plug-and-play switch is really all I'm willing to invest in for this project.",

Device management has become practically unusable — and all of this without any error messages.\n\n**What’s happening:**\n\n* Devices can’t be accessed, let alone deleted, renamed, or edited. The app just jumps back to the overview.\n* This affects all my essential skills: AOSU, Nuki, EuFy, eWeLink, Shelly, Tuya, Govee.\n* Newly added devices disappear right after confirmation — they’re not visible in the favorites or device list.\n* Favorites can’t be changed or saved. At times, I even get the message “Unable to load Favourites,” although they were initially visible.\n* No error messages, no logs, no response from Amazon.\n* After switching to a different Alexa account, the same issues reappear after a while.\n\nI suspect a cloud-side issue, since the behavior is identical across multiple devices and persists even after reinstalling the app. Other users have reported similar bugs — some going back weeks.\n\nAnd this is still the “old” Alexa — what’s coming our way with Alexa+?\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n* Has anyone experienced the same?\n* Are there any workarounds (e.g., via the web interface or voice commands)?\n* Has anyone tried bypassing the Alexa app entirely by creating a new, empty Alexa account and using Echo devices just as microphones/speakers for Home Assistant?\n* Has anyone received a meaningful response from Amazon support?",

    "selftext": "Is or has anyone else thought about doing this? Has anyone done it successfully? \n\nI'd like parts of my home to have lights turn on ONLY when there is a person detected. Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I have a Lenovo V15 G4 ABP - Type 83CR laptop, and I've had it since spring of this year. Ever since I've had it, my computer will just randomly restart when i use it without the charger (here's a link to a video of the incident occuring yesterday: [https://quickshare.samsungcloud.com/kjuVD32VAnWy](https://quickshare.samsungcloud.com/kjuVD32VAnWy)). it usually happens when the battery is at about 60% or 20%, but honestly it's pretty random. A few months ago, I ran into a related issue where windows has a hard time activating itself (which i think is the cause of these issues), which forced me to factory reset the computer. However, the issue still persists, and when it's not plugged in, it'll randomly restart, or sometimes say that Windows isn't responding. I'm not sure why. I'm fairly certain it's a software error as my computer hasn't received any physical stress, and i worry it might have something to do the with the files (i believe it was safe, just video, audio, screenshots and art, and a few apps) I transferred from my old computer (which became unusable bc of this issue). In general, I'm not sure what's going on, and I'm at a total loss as to how I can fix it, because this issue destroyed my previous computer and I don't want that to happen here.

I decided I wanted to replace my HDD because I have had it since 2020 and I'm having issues where my computer is downloading/updating slowly and I think it's because my hard drive is kind of just old and slowing my performance down. I couldn't defrag it either so that was another reason to replace it. I tried switching it out for WD - Blue 4TB PC Internal Hard Drive for Desktops. The problem has been that anytime I boot up my PC, it is not recognized. In device manager, it seen as \"Unknown Device\". In BIOS, it does not exist. In disk management, there is an endless loading of \"Connecting to virtual disk service\". I have tried checking if it's plugged in correctly and IT IS (same SATA cables and everything that I used with my old hard drive. I even switched back to the old one and it is recognized without any issues). I tried resetting virtual disk service and it still will not actually connect to show me the drive. I have tried updating the device and nothing happens. I have tried disabling it and rebooting and nothing. It's a little frustrating because if it comes down to the fact that the drive is dead upon me just having bought it, that's a bummer. Any and all advice is appreciated. I just want my PC to run smoothly.",

A Samsung Evo 2.5 SSD (plugged into SATA port 1). So I cloned the WD to the Samsung and told it to shut down after. (But also checked the option for hot swap.\n\nNow when I attempted to boot the machine back up, it goes straight to the bios, as if no storage is installed at all. I was like okay maybe it's just confused or something went wrong with the clone. So I just completely unplugged the 2.5 SSD (the one I was trying to clone to) and tried booting again. Straight to BIOS. Okay maybe it's a setting for boot options or secure boot. Well Secure boot is re-enabled (I don't recall turning it off but I definitely could have) and made sure that boot priority is set to UEFI Hard Disk as #1. The original WD m.2 is still being seen by the system in the BIOS and BIOS mode is still set to UEFI as well.\n\nAnd help or suggestions would be helpful.\n\nSPECS:\n\nWINDOWS 11  \nMPG B550 Gaming Plus (MS-7C56) (bios update from 9/24/21)  \nAMD Ryzen 5 3600  \n32GB RAM  \n7800XT GPU\n\nTitle is the tl;dr\n\n[BIOS Snapshot](https://imgur.com/a/YJmukxQ)\n\nEDIT: Found another post with a similar issues which could be mine as well: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Backup/comments/1h7gvf3/cloned\\_boot\\_drive\\_with\\_clonezilla\\_now\\_neither\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Backup/comments/1h7gvf3/cloned_boot_drive_with_clonezilla_now_neither_the/)\n\nIf it is the case....I'm not sure how to go about getting those partitions back on the original or clone\n\n",

When I turn it off it stays black or very glitchy if I keep trying to turn it on unless I leave it off for a whole day. It runs fine and I'm able to connect it to a TV via HDMI and use it through that. I've tried a driver reset and updating the drivers, virus scan, deleting recently downloaded software (I read online that if it's app incompatibility Task Manager is unlikely to be affected by flickering but it is, so I don't think it's this) and nothing has worked. So I think it's probably an internal issue, I have admittedly dropped my laptop on the floor a few times over the years. \n\nWhat kind of issue could it be exactly? I don't know much about hardware and have never opened a laptop so I don't know if I should try looking into it myself or just see a repair store. But if I knew exactly what I needed to do and how to do it I think I'd give it a try.",

As you can imagine, this is infuriating. All traffic dies, wifi devices stay in network but don't have any connection to the internet itself, and you can't ping anything. Thing is, UDP traffic, like existing discord calls or the likes, will keep working, even if it's like crap.\n\nI suspect it's an NAT issue, which would mean the only fix is to bite the bullet and buy a good router and leave this piece of crap in bridge mode, but i'd like to get a second opinion if at all possible before doing that. Any wisdom to share? Thanks!\n\nEDIT: I forgot to say that when this happens, even internal traffic dies. You can't even ping the router itself, or even get to the management interface until it subsides.",

It will ripple as though it's being pressed on very hard and red-black pixels/spots will sometimes appear. The pixels go away if you rub at them gently - but obviously I don't want to mess with it too much and cause serious damage, so I've just stopped closing the laptop. No issues as long as I don't do that, but I mean, it's not ideal.\n\nWhat might be causing this? And can I do anything about it short of replacing the screen/casing, or can I just not take my laptop anywhere anymore? Thanks.",

Even when i for example completely disable sound in my VLC media player AND in windows volume mixer, this still happens on fully muted videos and programs.\n\nThis has been happening since yesterday.

On said hard drive I had around 8,000 MP3s. I cannot wrap my head around simply losing them. But...said MP3s also exist on an iPod Classic (that I still regularly use). \n\nSo, I plugged the iPod into my Mac, showed hidden folders, opened iPod Control > Music, and copied all the Music back onto my Mac. What I am left with now is approximately 8,000 files with names like XPRT.mp3 and no way of knowing if that's Dr. Dre or Taylor Swift without opening up and listening to each of the 8,000 files. Surely there must be an easier way to return them all to their previously nice file names??? I would dearly love to be able to know which file is which. \n\nI have spent all day pulling them into Foobar2000 and have about 800 of them renamed, but man this is a tedious and time consuming way of doing it. Is there a way to batch do it? Foobar2000 is having less than 50% success with it, too. ",

Because most of this drive is filled simply with small things under a gigabyte or just the actual os and bios and whatnot of my computer the drive is just completely filled, valorant, even though i deleted it, stays on that drive taking up 40 gigabytes of space. When i try to uninstall it from my storage menu it just says that it simply cannot find the file and therefore cant delete it. I am no better than a computer and also am unable to find the file, how am i supposed to go about doing this?",

    "selftext": "Hi r/techsupport !!!\n\nFirst of all, apologies if this is the wrong place to ask about this. If so, please let me know where I should go instead!\n\nMy laptop (specs at bottom) has had severe instability issues for a while, including random freeze-ups, crashes (in Windows and Linux), sudden restarts and so on. Reinstalling OS (or using a different one), updating BIOS, switching around BIOS settings etc. did little to change it.\n\nI've tried testing the memory with 15 Memtest86+ passes, CPU stress tests (OCCT, stress-ng on linux), etc. All of them passed with no problem.\n\nOne way I found to consistently cause a crash is to boot the system plugged in on AC power, then switch it from \"Performance\" mode to \"Power Saver\" mode. On linux, the system kernel panics within a few ms of doing this, but on Windows it takes \\~5 seconds before crashing.\n\nI noticed that it is much likely to crash when it is idle (or in any case, not under heavy load). When running intensive tasks (eg. gaming) it can go for hours without even a single crash, but then idle it crashes every few minutes sometimes.  \nIt is also more stable when plugged in than on battery.\n\nWindows bugchecks (BSODs) most commonly use the following stopcodes:\n\n* IRQL\\_NOT\\_LESS\\_OR\\_EQUAL\n* KERNEL\\_BUFFER\\_STACK\\_OVERRUN\n* KERNEL\\_AUTO\\_BOOST\\_INVALID\\_LOCK\\_RELEASE\n* PAGE\\_FAULT\\_IN\\_NONPAGED\\_AREA\n\nbut a variety of others.  \nMost commonly the file that failed is claimed to be ntoskrnl.exe, though I have seen it being acpi.sys once or twice.\n\nLinux kernel panics usually error out with \"fatal exception in interrupt\", \"attempted to kill idle task\", or \"attempted to kill init\". Reading the logs, most commonly memory or pointer related issues eg. paging issues, kernel null pointer dereferences etc. from a variety of different drivers.\n\nBased on my debugging attempts (reading linux kernel logs, trying (but failing) to get windows traces, and general observation) I am almost confident this is a power management issue (faulty power rails, or maybe something to do with the EC?).\n\n[This pastebin](https://pastebin.com/D0u2wXJn) has some linux kernel panic logs if it's of any help (I got them by streaming journalctl through ssh), this is an easily reproducible scenario so if necessary I can provide different logging levels etc.\n\n[Here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/rwvnpvdyp95puvz/Minidump.zip/file) is also a zip file containing 5 Windows minidumps, I wasn't able to get much of anything useful from it but someone with more expertise than me might get something good out of them.\n\nWould really appreciate some pointers. Tried to figure this one out myself but it's beyond me. Thanks in advance everyone <3\n\n**Laptop specs:**  \nModel: ROG Flow X16 (2022) GV601RM  \nCPU: Ryzen 9 6900HS  \nDedicated GPU: RTX 3060  \nIntegrated GPU: Radeon 680M  \nRAM: 16GB DDR5  \nOSes: Windows 11 and a variety of different linux distros (currently installed Arch Linux). The issue occurs on any OS\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nMy laptop (ROG Flow X16 GV601RM; specs above) has stability issues - lockups, freezing, crashing etc. on any OS. Reinstalls, BIOS setting changes etc. did not help.  \nWhen systems crash (BSOD/kernel panic) they usually mention memory-related errors (paging, pointer dereferencing) coming from a variety of different drivers and components.  \nThe system is more stable on AC power than battery, and it is also more stable under heavy load than when idle.  \nSwitching from a high-performance power mode to a power saving mode consistently causes a crash.",

I quickly unplugged it. After a few seconds, the screen returned to normal, but the desktop wasn't showing (Windows 11). But just logging out and logging back in was enough to get it back to normal, or almost, now there's no longer any screen brightness transition, it's just a sharp transition when I change the brightness. I of course disabled the overclock also.\n\nMy theory is that this sudden power outage may have corrupted the NVidia drivers, and I do intend to reinstall to fix that. But before I do I'd like to know if what happened could have caused any problems for my device, and if so what I could do to find out, some test or safety procedure, or even if what happened is considered normal.

I have an issue that I suspect lies with the cheapo ISP Sagemcom f4st3890 AP/Modem/Router combo.\n\nWhat happens about 7 times a day is the internet dies completely. As you can imagine, this is infuriating. All traffic dies, wifi devices stay in network but don't have any connection to the internet itself, and you can't ping anything. Thing is, UDP traffic, like existing discord calls or the likes, will keep working, even if it's like crap.\n\nI suspect it's an NAT issue, which would mean the only fix is to bite the bullet and buy a good router and leave this piece of crap in bridge mode, but i'd like to get a second opinion if at all possible before doing that. Any wisdom to share? Thanks!\n\nEDIT: I forgot to say that when this happens, even internal traffic dies. You can't even ping the router itself, or even get to the management interface until it subsides.",

Certainly niche.\n\nI'll try to keep the backstory short -- my external hard drive with all my music on it shit the bed and even a data recovery centre was unable to save its life (bye bye, $2,500, it was nice knowing you...). On said hard drive I had around 8,000 MP3s. I cannot wrap my head around simply losing them. But...said MP3s also exist on an iPod Classic (that I still regularly use). \n\nSo, I plugged the iPod into my Mac, showed hidden folders, opened iPod Control > Music, and copied all the Music back onto my Mac. What I am left with now is approximately 8,000 files with names like XPRT.mp3 and no way of knowing if that's Dr. Dre or Taylor Swift without opening up and listening to each of the 8,000 files. Surely there must be an easier way to return them all to their previously nice file names??? I would dearly love to be able to know which file is which. \n\nI have spent all day pulling them into Foobar2000 and have about 800 of them renamed, but man this is a tedious and time consuming way of doing it. Is there a way to batch do it? Foobar2000 is having less than 50% success with it, too. ",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, how are you all? 👋\n\nI recently built a high-performance PC, and here are the specs: •\tCPU: i7-1400K •\tGPU: ASUS TUF RTX 4070 Super (12 GB) •\tRAM: 64 GB\n\nI’ve been having a bad experience with VMware. I tried installing Kali Linux using the ISO method, but it feels really slow and laggy. I also tried the VMware prebuilt image—same issue. And please don’t say “increase RAM or CPU usage,” because I’ve already done that, and it didn’t help.\n\nWith VirtualBox, everything worked fine at first, but after around two months it also started to get slow and laggy, just like VMware.\n\nHere’s what I’ve already tried, but none of these helped: •\tIncreased RAM allocation •\tIncreased CPU cores •\tEnabled 3D acceleration (also tried disabling it—no difference) •\tDisabled Hyper-V and any related features in Windows\n\nPlease, I’m looking for real solutions, because I’m tired of this issue. I just want a smooth experience running Kali Linux.",

    "selftext": "I have a Lenovo V15 G4 ABP - Type 83CR laptop, and I've had it since spring of this year. Ever since I've had it, my computer will just randomly restart when i use it without the charger (here's a link to a video of the incident occuring yesterday: [https://quickshare.samsungcloud.com/kjuVD32VAnWy](https://quickshare.samsungcloud.com/kjuVD32VAnWy)). it usually happens when the battery is at about 60% or 20%, but honestly it's pretty random. A few months ago, I ran into a related issue where windows has a hard time activating itself (which i think is the cause of these issues), which forced me to factory reset the computer. However, the issue still persists, and when it's not plugged in, it'll randomly restart, or sometimes say that Windows isn't responding. I'm not sure why. I'm fairly certain it's a software error as my computer hasn't received any physical stress, and i worry it might have something to do the with the files (i believe it was safe, just video, audio, screenshots and art, and a few apps) I transferred from my old computer (which became unusable bc of this issue). In general, I'm not sure what's going on, and I'm at a total loss as to how I can fix it, because this issue destroyed my previous computer and I don't want that to happen here. I've posted about this issue several times but I haven't received a response, and I'm really worried. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.",

I couldn't defrag it either so that was another reason to replace it. I tried switching it out for WD - Blue 4TB PC Internal Hard Drive for Desktops. The problem has been that anytime I boot up my PC, it is not recognized. In device manager, it seen as \"Unknown Device\". In BIOS, it does not exist. In disk management, there is an endless loading of \"Connecting to virtual disk service\". I have tried checking if it's plugged in correctly and IT IS (same SATA cables and everything that I used with my old hard drive. I even switched back to the old one and it is recognized without any issues). I tried resetting virtual disk service and it still will not actually connect to show me the drive. I have tried updating the device and nothing happens. I have tried disabling it and rebooting and nothing. It's a little frustrating because if it comes down to the fact that the drive is dead upon me just having bought it, that's a bummer. Any and all advice is appreciated. I just want my PC to run smoothly.",

A Samsung Evo 2.5 SSD (plugged into SATA port 1). So I cloned the WD to the Samsung and told it to shut down after. (But also checked the option for hot swap.\n\nNow when I attempted to boot the machine back up, it goes straight to the bios, as if no storage is installed at all. I was like okay maybe it's just confused or something went wrong with the clone. So I just completely unplugged the 2.5 SSD (the one I was trying to clone to) and tried booting again. Straight to BIOS. Okay maybe it's a setting for boot options or secure boot. Well Secure boot is re-enabled (I don't recall turning it off but I definitely could have) and made sure that boot priority is set to UEFI Hard Disk as #1. The original WD m.2 is still being seen by the system in the BIOS and BIOS mode is still set to UEFI as well.\n\nAnd help or suggestions would be helpful.\n\nSPECS:\n\nWINDOWS 11  \nMPG B550 Gaming Plus (MS-7C56) (bios update from 9/24/21)  \nAMD Ryzen 5 3600  \n32GB RAM  \n7800XT GPU\n\nTitle is the tl;dr\n\n[BIOS Snapshot](https://imgur.com/a/YJmukxQ)\n\nEDIT: Found another post with a similar issues which could be mine as well: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Backup/comments/1h7gvf3/cloned\\_boot\\_drive\\_with\\_clonezilla\\_now\\_neither\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Backup/comments/1h7gvf3/cloned_boot_drive_with_clonezilla_now_neither_the/)\n\nIf it is the case....I'm not sure how to go about getting those partitions back on the original or clone\n\n",

It runs fine and I'm able to connect it to a TV via HDMI and use it through that. I've tried a driver reset and updating the drivers, virus scan, deleting recently downloaded software (I read online that if it's app incompatibility Task Manager is unlikely to be affected by flickering but it is, so I don't think it's this) and nothing has worked. So I think it's probably an internal issue, I have admittedly dropped my laptop on the floor a few times over the years. \n\nWhat kind of issue could it be exactly? I don't know much about hardware and have never opened a laptop so I don't know if I should try looking into it myself or just see a repair store.

    "selftext": "I accidentally deleted a bunch of iMessages from my iPhone, they were also removed from “Recently Deleted.” Since both my iPhone and MacBook Pro had Messages in iCloud enabled, the deletions synced across devices.\n\nLuckily, I caught it quickly and turned on my MacBook, saw the messages were still there, and immediately:\n\t•\tTurned off Wi-Fi\n\t•\tDisabled Messages in iCloud on the MacBook\n\t•\tAlso turned off Messages in iCloud on my iPhone\n\nSo now:\n\t•\tMy MacBook still has all the messages\n\t•\tMy iPhone does not\n\t•\tMessages in iCloud is OFF on both devices\n\nI then waited 30 days for iCloud to delete its stored messages (per Apple’s auto-delete policy), and iCloud.com shows zero message storage. But when I re-enabled Messages in iCloud on the MacBook, instead of uploading my message archive, it started downloading messages (as if the deleted iCloud archive was still there!).\n\n⸻\n\nMy question:\n\nHow can I safely restore my MacBook’s local iMessages back to my iPhone, without risking losing them to iCloud’s sync system?\n\nI want my Mac’s messages to become the “source of truth,” but Apple Support said there’s no way to force sync in one direction.\n\nAny help or suggestions would be appreciated — especially if anyone’s tried restoring messages from Mac to iPhone without iCloud doing something destructive. 🙏\n",

    "selftext": "Basically what the header is-\nI have a PC, and i will be honest, i cant tell you much about what the system is other than having an RTX 3080 and 9 fans. \n\nShe is beautiful but she needs to be cleaned really badly, lots of dust build-up and i am aware. It has gotten to the point where i get nervous that the PC is going to overheat, but my task manager has never read temps above 85 celsius. I know thats not great, but its not throttling. \n\nI was gaming and using my PC for awhile tonight, probably 6 hours or so and maybe around the 3rd hour mark i started to smell a very foul smell; like someone passing horrible gas. It smelled like sulfur maybe and just very gassy. Now, i have two dogs and one of them has stomach issues and so i thought she was just having a horrible night of gas. But after putting my PC into sleep mode and doing other things for about an hour, i came back into the room and noticed the smell was gone. I had left my bedroom door open to ventilate, so i figured my dog’s gas dissipated.\n\nBut then i went to “wake” my pc to shut it down for the night and i got a huge whiff of that same smell. So now i am worried that there is something wrong with my PC.\n\nIf worst comes to worst, and i have something “leaking” in my PC (i am completely uneducated in the hardware realm and have only read things about leaking batteries or capacitors)- is this going to be dangerous fumes?\n\nI am aware its an electrical hazard so irs completely unplugged and will not be used until i can get it into the shop. But is it safe to keep in my bedroom with me and my dogs after smelling that odor? Any hazard to my health or is it just a hazard to electrical/fire safety?\n\nTLDR:\nIm being overly cautious after smelling a very rotten/gassy smell in my room after being on my PC. Suspected it was my dog passing horrible gas (to give you an idea of what this odor snelled like) but it seems to be possibly coming from my PC. I have unplugged it and i have my ceiling fan and bedroom door open, but is it possible that my PC could be leaking any hazardous fumes that could hurt me or my dogs’ health? The PC is in my bedroom.",

    "selftext": "Sorry to bother you fine folk, but this has me completely stumped, to the point of having to come here to ask for help. I have an issue that I suspect lies with the cheapo ISP Sagemcom f4st3890 AP/Modem/Router combo.\n\nWhat happens about 7 times a day is the internet dies completely. As you can imagine, this is infuriating. All traffic dies, wifi devices stay in network but don't have any connection to the internet itself, and you can't ping anything. Thing is, UDP traffic, like existing discord calls or the likes, will keep working, even if it's like crap.\n\nI suspect it's an NAT issue, which would mean the only fix is to bite the bullet and buy a good router and leave this piece of crap in bridge mode, but i'd like to get a second opinion if at all possible before doing that. Any wisdom to share? Thanks!\n\nEDIT: I forgot to say that when this happens, even internal traffic dies. You can't even ping the router itself, or even get to the management interface until it subsides.",

It will ripple as though it's being pressed on very hard and red-black pixels/spots will sometimes appear.

    "selftext": "Maybe a really dumb question. Certainly niche.\n\nI'll try to keep the backstory short -- my external hard drive with all my music on it shit the bed and even a data recovery centre was unable to save its life (bye bye, $2,500, it was nice knowing you...). On said hard drive I had around 8,000 MP3s. I cannot wrap my head around simply losing them. But...said MP3s also exist on an iPod Classic (that I still regularly use). \n\nSo, I plugged the iPod into my Mac, showed hidden folders, opened iPod Control > Music, and copied all the Music back onto my Mac. What I am left with now is approximately 8,000 files with names like XPRT.mp3 and no way of knowing if that's Dr. Dre or Taylor Swift without opening up and listening to each of the 8,000 files. Surely there must be an easier way to return them all to their previously nice file names??? I would dearly love to be able to know which file is which. \n\nI have spent all day pulling them into Foobar2000 and have about 800 of them renamed, but man this is a tedious and time consuming way of doing it. Is there a way to batch do it? Foobar2000 is having less than 50% success with it, too. ",

Ever since I've had it, my computer will just randomly restart when i use it without the charger (here's a link to a video of the incident occuring yesterday: [https://quickshare.samsungcloud.com/kjuVD32VAnWy](https://quickshare.samsungcloud.com/kjuVD32VAnWy)). it usually happens when the battery is at about 60% or 20%, but honestly it's pretty random. A few months ago, I ran into a related issue where windows has a hard time activating itself (which i think is the cause of these issues), which forced me to factory reset the computer. However, the issue still persists, and when it's not plugged in, it'll randomly restart, or sometimes say that Windows isn't responding. I'm not sure why. I'm fairly certain it's a software error as my computer hasn't received any physical stress, and i worry it might have something to do the with the files (i believe it was safe, just video, audio, screenshots and art, and a few apps) I transferred from my old computer (which became unusable bc of this issue). In general, I'm not sure what's going on, and I'm at a total loss as to how I can fix it, because this issue destroyed my previous computer and I don't want that to happen here.

    "selftext": "i need to emphasise that i am very pc illiterate and will try to explain whats going on to the best of my ability. \n\ni genuinely dont know whats happening. it started off when my bf tried connecting my pc to my tv so we can watch something since my tv is old and stupid. sound wasnt coming through so we just connected the pc back ti the monitor to watch on there instead. still no sound. in fact the speakers have disappeared from the little thingy when u click on sound setting or wtv its called. its not there. \n\ni didnt really care because all i play is sims (modded, if that makes a difference) and i can live with no sound. but i will say, when i first turn in my pc it plays that little tone sound (does this make sense) but gets cut off like halfway. \n\ni wasnt entirely fussed about the speakers but now my pc wont even load the login screen. it just says alphasync with the spinning loading thing.\n\ni spoke to a friend and he walked me through some stuff. essentially i would turn the pc off and back in at the plug and that would jumpstart a blue screen with options (shut down, advanced options -> troubleshoot, restart, etc) instead of the endless loading spiral. the friend walked me through what to click, i honestly couldnt tell you off the top of my head what i did, and i managed to get to the login screen and the pc worked fine. until it didnt and the same problem keeps happening. \n\ni should probably mention that the reason i think the whole loading screen issue started was because i downloaded a load of new mods to play in the sims but then my sims kept crashing and was really slow, so i shut the sims down but the rest of my pc was also really slow so i shut the pc down and then turned it back on hoping it would fix itself i guess. \n\nim genuinely dont know what to do, my friends are clueless, and i dont have the money ti take it to a technician bc im broke to the max. \n\nim very sorry is this didnt make much sense and that this is very very long. and for any typos. \n\ni will greatly appreciate and accept any advice at all because honestly im losing my shit now. \n\n<33",

    "title": "I replaced my HDD and it won't show up on my disk manager.",
    "selftext": "So, I have two drives. My OS is on an SSD. No issues there. I decided I wanted to replace my HDD because I have had it since 2020 and I'm having issues where my computer is downloading/updating slowly and I think it's because my hard drive is kind of just old and slowing my performance down. I couldn't defrag it either so that was another reason to replace it. I tried switching it out for WD - Blue 4TB PC Internal Hard Drive for Desktops. The problem has been that anytime I boot up my PC, it is not recognized. In device manager, it seen as \"Unknown Device\". In BIOS, it does not exist. In disk management, there is an endless loading of \"Connecting to virtual disk service\". I have tried checking if it's plugged in correctly and IT IS (same SATA cables and everything that I used with my old hard drive. I even switched back to the old one and it is recognized without any issues). I tried resetting virtual disk service and it still will not actually connect to show me the drive. I have tried updating the device and nothing happens. I have tried disabling it and rebooting and nothing. It's a little frustrating because if it comes down to the fact that the drive is dead upon me just having bought it, that's a bummer. Any and all advice is appreciated. I just want my PC to run smoothly.",

    "selftext": "Title gives the general gist of the problem:\n\nRundown is I have a machine that the OS is installed on a WD Blue m.2 drive and with windows saying a new update isn't possible because of whatever it said, I decided to clone it to another drive that I have in the machine. A Samsung Evo 2.5 SSD (plugged into SATA port 1). So I cloned the WD to the Samsung and told it to shut down after. (But also checked the option for hot swap.\n\nNow when I attempted to boot the machine back up, it goes straight to the bios, as if no storage is installed at all. I was like okay maybe it's just confused or something went wrong with the clone. So I just completely unplugged the 2.5 SSD (the one I was trying to clone to) and tried booting again. Straight to BIOS. Okay maybe it's a setting for boot options or secure boot. Well Secure boot is re-enabled (I don't recall turning it off but I definitely could have) and made sure that boot priority is set to UEFI Hard Disk as #1. The original WD m.2 is still being seen by the system in the BIOS and BIOS mode is still set to UEFI as well.\n\nAnd help or suggestions would be helpful.\n\nSPECS:\n\nWINDOWS 11  \nMPG B550 Gaming Plus (MS-7C56) (bios update from 9/24/21)  \nAMD Ryzen 5 3600  \n32GB RAM  \n7800XT GPU\n\nTitle is the tl;dr\n\n[BIOS Snapshot](https://imgur.com/a/YJmukxQ)\n\nEDIT: Found another post with a similar issues which could be mine as well: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Backup/comments/1h7gvf3/cloned\\_boot\\_drive\\_with\\_clonezilla\\_now\\_neither\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Backup/comments/1h7gvf3/cloned_boot_drive_with_clonezilla_now_neither_the/)\n\nIf it is the case....I'm not sure how to go about getting those partitions back on the original or clone\n\n",

    "title": "Screen Flickering",
    "selftext": "HP Laptop 15s-eq2036na, Windows 11\n\nMy laptop screen has been glitching out and flickering whenever I turn it on, it starts out subtle then progressively gets worse until the screen goes black. When I turn it off it stays black or very glitchy if I keep trying to turn it on unless I leave it off for a whole day. It runs fine and I'm able to connect it to a TV via HDMI and use it through that. I've tried a driver reset and updating the drivers, virus scan, deleting recently downloaded software (I read online that if it's app incompatibility Task Manager is unlikely to be affected by flickering but it is, so I don't think it's this) and nothing has worked. So I think it's probably an internal issue, I have admittedly dropped my laptop on the floor a few times over the years. \n\nWhat kind of issue could it be exactly? I don't know much about hardware and have never opened a laptop so I don't know if I should try looking into it myself or just see a repair store. But if I knew exactly what I needed to do and how to do it I think I'd give it a try.",
