    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI‚Äôd like to share the app I‚Äôve been working on over the past few months - **Dory**.\n\nI think the video does a much better job of explaining what it‚Äôs all about, so feel free to check it out here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z\\_Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z_Q)\n\n**Dory is an app switcher that lets you quickly cycle through apps without moving your hand from the mouse, keyboard or trackpad - and without needing to remember any shortcuts.**\n\nClick a mouse button - or a modifier key if both hands are on the keyboard - and type the first letter of the app‚Äôs name.\n\nFind apps using the first letter, middle letters, acronyms, or similar names.\n\nIf multiple apps share that letter, just keep tapping it to cycle through them.\n\nYou can also press the middle mouse button and start typing the app‚Äôs name directly.\n\nPrefer tapping over holding? No problem. With Press Mode, you can open Dory‚Äôs sleek UI using a global shortcut or a **trackpad gesture!** (new)\n\nDory works right out of the box - and over time, it learns which apps you use most and prioritizes them.\n\nNo extra shortcuts.\n\nNo setup. Nothing to remember.\n\n\\--\n\nIt's currently $4.99 on the¬†[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dory-app-switcher/id6746273626?mt=12)¬†(**One-time purchase**.¬†**No subscription.**) for a limited time.",

    "title": "iPhone & Wi-Fi 7",
    "selftext": "> For those unaware, Apple claims that the iPhone 16 and 17 series support 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), but in practice this is **highly limited** compared with the full standard.  \n>  \n> **Wi-Fi 7‚Äôs most important technical features include:**  \n>  \n> ‚Ä¢ **Up to 240 MHz channel width on the 5 GHz band**  \n> ‚Ä¢ **Up to 320 MHz channel width on the 6 GHz band**  \n> ‚Ä¢ **4096-QAM modulation**  \n> ‚Ä¢ **MLMR MLO (Multi-Link Multi-Radio)** capable of aggregating multiple Wi-Fi bands into one high-throughput pipeline  \n>  \n> While Apple meets the *minimum certification requirement* (MLSR MLO), it disables nearly all optional features that make Wi-Fi 7 truly high-performance. As a result, **iPhone 16 and 17 models perform at speeds comparable to Wi-Fi 6/6E**, while other flagship phones achieve **3‚Äì4√ó higher throughput** using the optional features Apple ignored for two generations.  \n>  \n> For context, Wi-Fi 6/6E tops out at **160 MHz-wide channels**, **1024-QAM modulation**, and only one Wi-Fi band at a time ‚Äî yielding peak theoretical speeds around **2402 Mbps**.  \n>  \n> Wi-Fi 7, when fully implemented, doubles channel width to 320 MHz, quadruples QAM density to 4096, and enables **true multi-band operation via MLO**, dramatically increasing real-world throughput.  \n>  \n> Apple‚Äôs iPhones, however, still restrict channels to 160 MHz, leave QAM at 1024, and only use MLO as a basic failover mechanism ‚Äî effectively **Wi-Fi 6/6E with rudimentary band steering**.  \n>  \n> Some argue that wider channels, higher QAM, or MLMR MLO would drain battery. While Apple may have designed these limits intentionally, other flagship phones fully enable these features **without widespread battery complaints**, showing it‚Äôs a feasible design choice.  \n>  \n> Others claim that 5 GHz doesn‚Äôt support 240 MHz channels ‚Äî but in regions like the **United States**, access points can operate at 240 MHz on 5 GHz, and Apple‚Äôs iPhones simply don‚Äôt take advantage of it.  \n>  \n> Apple‚Äôs documentation confirms that the Broadcom chip in the iPhone 16 series and the N1 chip in the iPhone 17 series are **capped to a single 160 MHz band**. Meanwhile, users have observed the performance discrepancy across multiple forums and reviews:  \n>  \n> ‚Ä¢ [Jason Deegan review](https://jasondeegan.com/iphone-16-review-disappointment-with-wifi-7-performance/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [Apple forum complaints](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255812908?sortBy=rank)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [MacRumors forum complaints](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-buy-wifi7-router.2438418/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [Apple's official tech specs of 16 & 17 series](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/wi-fi-ethernet-specifications-apple-devices-dep268652e6c/web)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [TP-Link Community complaints](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/705570)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [YouTube comparison of the 16 series](https://youtu.be/07FRuS67iD8)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [YouTube comparison of the 17 series](https://youtu.be/VtimPHdiv7U)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [YouTube warning not to buy Wi-Fi 7 routers](https://youtube.com/shorts/Pc3dAEoPPFo)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/apple-n1-chip-has-wi-fi-7-limitation/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [5GStore analysis](https://5gstore.com/blog/2025/09/16/apple-n1-chip-wifi-7-iphone-17/#what-wccftech-found-apples-n-1-chip-its-limitation)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [PhoneArena article](https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-16-pro-models-prevented-from-reaching-full-wi-fi-7-potential_id163151)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [iThinkDiff article](https://www.ithinkdiff.com/apple-n1-chip-iphone-17-wifi-7-limit/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [iPhoneWired article](https://iphonewired.com/news/857921/)  \n>  \n> In conclusion, many users invest in premium iPhones and Wi-Fi 7 equipment expecting the full benefits of the standard. Apple‚Äôs current implementation delivers **minimal improvement over Wi-Fi 6/6E**.  \n>  \n> **If you‚Äôd like to see full Wi-Fi 7 features enabled on Apple devices, submit feedback via Safari:**  \n\n1. Type *AppleFeedback://* in the address bar and press Enter  \n2. Press **New Feedback**  \n3. Tap **iOS & iPadOS**  \n4. Enter *iPhone Wi-Fi 7 features* as the title  \n5.

    "title": "The iPhone Upgrade Program is absolutely NOT compatible with AppleCare One",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR: DO NOT try and add your iPhone Upgrade Program iPhone to AppleCare One, unless you want significant problems down the road.**\n\nI added my 16 Pro to AppleCare One in July, a few days after the program started. The support specialist read me boilerplate along the lines of \"In order to remain enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program, you must immediately add your phone to AppleCare One to ensure no gap in coverage\". I did that, got a gift card back for \\~$120, and felt happy with myself.\n\nI successfully used the program to get a 17 Pro a few weeks ago, which I picked up in store. However, when I came to return the 16 Pro, the phone was marked as \"Enrolled in iPhone Upgrade Program\", but the option to close the loan was greyed out with \"loan details not found\". The store associates, up to and including supervisors were very confused by this and hadn't seen it before.\n\nAfter approximately **11 hours** on the phone with Citizens, and Apple Support, speaking with about 15 different people, all of whom were very friendly, but none of whom had any idea what had happened, and **3 visits** to the store, I was eventually advised to return the phone as a standalone trade-in, and receive a store gift card. I then had to call a special escalated support number and have them cancel the gift card and close the loan. (It still ended with a 4¬¢ balance, which I then had to pay Citizens by credit card üòÖ)\n\nI eventually had final confirmation from that escalated support line that, despite what AppleCare specialists tell you, and despite the boilerplate coverage language, cancelling the Theft and Loss protection to put your phone into AppleCare One **immediately** cancels the Upgrade Program eligibility. Obviously some systems are aware of this (allowing me to upgrade to 17 Pro), and some are not (preventing me from returning 16 Pro).\n\nI asked about the 17 Pro and confirmed that it too had been removed from the program. They advised me to do a Closed Box return in store and then immediately re-buy the same phone through the program to get it back into eligibility. I tried this, and while I passed the credit check and managed to keep my same phone, Verizon refused to activate the line (presumably because it was already connected - to me). As a result, I couldn't complete the transaction, and ended up having to re-buy my phone outright.\n\nTo Apple's credit, they recognized what a clusterfuck this was, and gave me a credit of $250, which I used for some AirPods Pro 3, and the guy in-store also gave me an Ultra Watch band for free. I also ended up with a negative loan balance of $260, which I got back as a check, and when you add back the $120 gift card back from July, I ended up doing ok. \n\nBut, it was an incredible time and energy suck and I did have to drop $1400 all in one go. I am lucky that I could just do that otherwise I would have left the store without my phone and then who knows what would have happened. I do not recommend this adventure to anyone. \n\nHopefully by the time the next phones are released there will be a proper integrated upgrade path, but for now, if you want to preserve your sanity, just stick with Theft and Loss coverage.\n\n ",

    "title": "Hazel is overkill for 90% of users. Mine works in 3 clicks.",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple! üëã\n\nI'm excited to share Neatify, a macOS productivity app I've been working on for automatic file organization.\n\n# \"Wait, isn't this just Hazel?\"\n\nFair question. I know Hazel exists, and it's an incredibly powerful tool. But here's the thing: Hazel is built for people who love to customize every detail. **Neatify is built for people who want their files organized instantly, without setup or scripting.**\n\n**I made Neatify for people who:**\n\n* Value automation that works right away\n* Want images in one folder, PDFs in another, done\n* Prefer project-based file routing without extra configuration\n* Want clarity instead of complexity\n\nThink of it this way: Hazel is a custom-built PC. Neatify is a MacBook that just works.\n\nBoth are powerful, but one lets you skip the setup and get things done faster.\n\nIf you enjoy building complex automation workflows, Hazel is fantastic. If you just want your files to go where they belong while you focus on your work, Neatify is built for you.\n\n# The Problem I'm Solving\n\nYou're working on multiple projects simultaneously. Literature essay, art history presentation, geopolitics research paper. Files are everywhere. Downloads folder is chaos. Every time you save or download something, you face decision fatigue: \"Where should this go?\"\n\nYou could use Hazel, but after 30 minutes of documentation and rule setup, you're more overwhelmed than when you started.\n\n# How Neatify Works\n\n**üéØ Project-Based Organization**\n\nCreate a project structure in 3 clicks:\n\n1. Name your project (e.g., \"Literature Essay\")\n2. Select file types to manage (Images, PDFs, Presentations)\n3. Choose location (Desktop, Documents, wherever)\n\nDone. Now every image you download automatically goes to Literature Essay/Images. Every PDF to Literature Essay/PDFs. No manual sorting.\n\n**‚ö°Ô∏è Smart File Sorting with Saved Rules**\n\nCreate reusable sorting configurations. One for work, one for personal files, one for creative projects. Switch between them from the menu bar in one click.\n\n**üîÑ Quick Sorter**\n\nNeed to organize something right now? Quick Sorter lets you point at a folder, pick file types, and start sorting immediately. Perfect for one-off tasks.\n\n**üßπ Bulk File Organizer**\n\nGot a messy folder with 500 mixed files? Select it, and Neatify reorganizes everything into a clean structure (Visual/Images, Visual/Videos, Audio, Code/Frontend, Code/Backend, Documents, etc.) in seconds.\n\n**üöÄ Set It and Forget It**\n\nEnable \"Launch at Login\" with a default project or rule. Neatify runs silently in your menu bar. Your files stay organized without you thinking about it.\n\n**üìä Menu Bar Control**\n\nClose the app, it lives in your menu bar. Switch sorting rules, pause/resume, or check status without opening the main window.\n\n# Why I Built This\n\nI was constantly switching between projects and drowning in file chaos. I tried Hazel, spent hours configuring it, felt more stressed, and thought: \"There has to be a simpler way.\"\n\nSo I built Neatify to do one thing really well: keep your files organized so you can focus on your work, not your folders.\n\nIt's 100% native macOS (Swift + SwiftUI), optimized for performance, and follows Apple's design language. No Electron bloat.\n\n# Try the Beta\n\nNeatify is currently in public beta on TestFlight. I'd genuinely love your feedback, especially from anyone who's tried Hazel and found it too heavy, or anyone juggling multiple projects who's tired of file chaos.\n\nBeta Access: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/Eyp3uwZS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Eyp3uwZS)  \nWebsite: [https://neatifyhq.com](https://neatifyhq.com)  \nDemo: [https://neatifyhq.com/#demo](https://neatifyhq.com/#demo)\n\nI'd Love Your Thoughts On\n\n* Does the \"simpler alternative to Hazel\" positioning make sense?\n* What file organization pain points do you face daily?\n* For Hazel users: what would make you consider a faster, easier tool?\n* Any concerns about automatic file management?\n\nI'll be here all day answering questions, discussing workflows, or debating the merits of different organization philosophies. Thanks for reading! üôè",

Let me know if there‚Äôs anything you like about the app and what would you improve.\n\nI hope you‚Äôll enjoy it!\n\nCheck it out: https://apps.apple.com/app/slice-and-share/id6752774728",

    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

I DO NOT CARE about any of that. If i have an alarm set - i expect it to go off no matter what silly little setting could prevent it. It's an ALARM. It should just work.\n\nHonestly this is so basic and no one at apple is doing anything about it, which is either neglect or honestly at this point straight up malice towards their users.\n\nIs there a world in which we can actually do something about this?

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n‚Äã\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

The camera bump (or, plateau, as they‚Äôre now so eloquently calling it) is so big it‚Äôs even bulging out of the side slightly!\n\n\nThe lanyard is a nice inclusion though! It‚Äôs giving me 2013 iPod Touch vibes! Not to mention, I‚Äôve finally been downgraded to USB-C!\n\nJoking aside, I received this emergency radio and kept thinking it reminded me of something I had seen recently. I turned it sideways and it hit me suddenly‚Ä¶ iPhone!\n\nOnce I made the realization, I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at how much this radio resembled the new iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. I‚Äôm not sure whether or not this is intentional by the manufacturer, but I thought it was definitely worth a share!\n\nTake care!\n\n",

But never used it before. \n\nFrom what I read, we can take it to apple for it to be repaired for a fee, or request and express replacement for a bit higher fee where they send a replacement and you post your phone number \n\nWhat happens when they repair yours? Do they then send it back, you swap again, and send the replacement back?\n\nWhen they repair yours phone due to a broken glass, do they also replace the battery (automatically or upon request)? As it‚Äôs 90% already, it would be a good opportunity to get a refresh battery. \n\nIf we get a refurbished replacement, do they always come with a new battery?\n\nI read online that people just smash up their phone to get a new one or dip it in water, it just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me but I really would like the battery to be refreshed (as it dropped to 90% rather quickly) or get a refurbished one without feeling too bad ethically.

    "selftext": "So far, I like it! The performance has been excellent! But, I have to ask, is there no end to how thick they‚Äôre willing to make these things? The camera bump (or, plateau, as they‚Äôre now so eloquently calling it) is so big it‚Äôs even bulging out of the side slightly!\n\n\nThe lanyard is a nice inclusion though! It‚Äôs giving me 2013 iPod Touch vibes! Not to mention, I‚Äôve finally been downgraded to USB-C!\n\nJoking aside, I received this emergency radio and kept thinking it reminded me of something I had seen recently. I turned it sideways and it hit me suddenly‚Ä¶ iPhone!\n\nOnce I made the realization, I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at how much this radio resembled the new iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. I‚Äôm not sure whether or not this is intentional by the manufacturer, but I thought it was definitely worth a share!\n\nTake care!\n\n",

But never used it before. \n\nFrom what I read, we can take it to apple for it to be repaired for a fee, or request and express replacement for a bit higher fee where they send a replacement and you post your phone number \n\nWhat happens when they repair yours? Do they then send it back, you swap again, and send the replacement back?\n\nWhen they repair yours phone due to a broken glass, do they also replace the battery (automatically or upon request)? As it‚Äôs 90% already, it would be a good opportunity to get a refresh battery. \n\nIf we get a refurbished replacement, do they always come with a new battery?\n\nI read online that people just smash up their phone to get a new one or dip it in water, it just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me but I really would like the battery to be refreshed (as it dropped to 90% rather quickly) or get a refurbished one without feeling too bad ethically. What is the best way? ",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android üëã,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to¬†**WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is¬†**SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

    "selftext": "Recently, I was searching for flip phone reviews and saw an article on the Vertu website. The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

    "title": "[Dev] Introducing Media Bar - Control media playback from your status bar with swipe gestures!",
    "selftext": "Hi all! I've been working on something I think you'll find useful. **Media Bar** transforms your Android status bar into a functional media controller and progress indicator.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nInstead of pulling down notifications or switching apps to control your music/podcast/video, you can now:\n\n* **See media progress** as a thin colored bar along your status bar\n* **Swipe left/right** on the status bar to scrub through your media\n* **Tap, double-tap, or long-press** three invisible regions on the status bar for custom actions (play/pause, skip, jump forward/back, launch app, etc.)\n\n**How is this different from Android's Live Notifications or OneUI's Now Bar?**\n\nWhile Android's live notifications and Samsung's Now Bar are excellent features, Media Bar takes a different approach:\n\n* **Always visible, minimal footprint** \\- Just a thin line on your status bar (can be as small as 1 pixel), not a pill or expandable widget that takes screen real estate\n* **Blind muscle memory control** \\- Your entire status bar becomes an interactive surface. No need to look for or tap specific small buttons\n* **Works system-wide** \\- Doesn't matter which media app you're using or which Android skin you have\n* **Swipe to scrub** \\- Directly scrub through your media by swiping, rather than tapping skip buttons\n* **Deep customization** \\- Color coding for progress tracking, custom button zones, transparency options, etc.\n\nThink of it as complementary to those features - it's for when you want the most minimal, muscle-memory-based control possible.\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nI found myself constantly interrupting my workflow to control media playback - whether I was gaming, browsing, or working. I wanted something that was always visible and accessible without being intrusive.\n\n**The \"aha\" moment:**\n\nHere's the thing - **Media Bar might feel a bit unusual at first, but give it a day or two.** Once your muscle memory kicks in, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.\n\nImagine this: You're at the gym mid-rep and need to pause your music. Instead of fumbling to find the play button, your thumb just *knows* where to tap on the status bar. Or you're deep into a 3-hour podcast and want to skip ahead - a quick swipe does it without even looking.\n\n**That's the magic**: your fingers learn the zones, and suddenly media control becomes second nature. No more hunting for tiny buttons or pulling focus from what you're doing. It just... flows. I'm confident that once it becomes part of your routine, it'll feel indispensable.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n**Color coding options** \\- Solid colors, dynamic (based on album art/app), segments (changes color at different progress points), or gradients\n\n**Highly customizable** \\- Adjust the bar's thickness (down to 1 pixel!), position (top/bottom), transparency, button regions, and more\n\n**Smart behavior** \\- Auto-hides in fullscreen apps, works with any media player\n\nIf you want to give it a shot, [get it from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.mediabar)! I would love to hear what you guys think about it and happy to answer any questions you may have! I would specifically like to hear if you build a muscle memory for it! :)",

    "title": "I Switched from iPhone to Android: My Story of Losses and Gains",
    "selftext": "# Hey Reddit! I want to share my story of switching from iPhone to Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It wasn't just choosing a new phone; it was a real journey full of expectations, doubts, and unexpected discoveries.\n\n# Introduction: Seeking a New Experience\n\nI used an iPhone 13 Pro and it was almost perfect. Even when the Pixel 10 came out, I had no desire to watch the presentation. But over time, I started to feel a \"technological itch.\" I was tired of Apple's predictability and the lack of true innovation. When the 17th iPhone came out again without significant AI improvements, it was the final disappointment. On the horizon appeared the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra ‚Äî a symbol of freedom, customization, and powerful AI. This wasn't just a phone choice; it was a choice of a new philosophy. I dreamed of a world where I control my device, not the other way around.\n\n# Part I: Pros and Cons from My Experience\n\niPhone (iOS): The World I Left Behind\n\n‚Ä¢Pros (What I Miss):\n\n‚Ä¢\"Ecosystem magic\" is not a myth, but a reality. It's not just a set of features, but an invisible fabric that connects the family. I acutely felt this when I realized I could no longer see my wife's phone battery charge (a symbol of care) and disappeared from our shared fitness competition (a symbol of play and unity).\n\n‚Ä¢Flawless simplicity (\"It just works\"). AirPods connecting with animation, passwords autofilling without glitches, stable battery performance after updates. This reliability is not \"boring,\" but reassuring. It brings peace of mind, freeing my brain from having to \"fix\" basic things.\n\n‚Ä¢Predictability as an advantage. I always know what to expect. No unpleasant surprises, like a sudden battery drain or strange sleep metrics on the watch after an update. It's a world without rollercoasters.\n\n‚Ä¢Camera philosophy. The iPhone camera strives for a \"cinematic\" reality. It creates volumetric, pleasing-to-the-eye photos immediately, without the need to \"tinker\" with settings.\n\n‚Ä¢Well-designed password system. Passwords seemed like a simple app. But it's so well-designed that you don't need to remember many passwords; importantly, it generates passwords itself and works across other devices.\n\n‚Ä¢Integrated calls and messages. The ability to call other messengers from the built-in call app and a convenient built-in messaging app.\n\n‚Ä¢Health and fitness synchronization. Easy synchronization of a fitness tracker and app with the built-in health app.\n\n‚Ä¢Battery life. I'm impressed that such a small battery lasts an active day. No need to turn off Bluetooth and WiFi to save power.\n\n‚Ä¢User care. Features related to health, diary, and headphone usage monitoring.\n\n‚Ä¢Sound quality. Good sound from the speakers and the phone itself.\n\n‚Ä¢Size and dimensions. Exactly what I was looking for.\n\n‚Ä¢Face ID. A very convenient feature, especially at work where fingerprint unlock might be inconvenient.\n\n‚Ä¢Seamless Bluetooth connection. No problems connecting to Bluetooth devices.\n\n‚Ä¢Reminders. The \"Reminders\" app is very helpful for organizing thoughts and tasks.\n\n‚Ä¢Cons (Why I Left):\n\n‚Ä¢\"Golden cage.\" The feeling of being locked in. Dependence on AirDrop, iMessage, lack of flexibility. The desire to break free and try something new was incredibly strong.\n\n‚Ä¢Illusion of innovation. Annual updates brought minimal changes but cost maximum money. It felt like a waste.\n\n‚Ä¢Lack of control. I can't customize the system to my liking. I'm forced to live by Apple's rules. This is annoying when I know there could be something better and more convenient for me.\n\n‚Ä¢Notification limitations. Inability to change notification sounds in Instagram and Viber.\n\n‚Ä¢Browser limitations. On iPhone, you can't choose which browser to open news from the Google News app, which leads to a lot of ads.\n\nSamsung (Android/One UI): The World I Chose\n\n‚Ä¢Pros (What I'm Fighting For):\n\n‚Ä¢True freedom and customization. The ability to customize everything ‚Äî from the desktop to system functions via Good Lock. It's the feeling that you are the master of your device. It's my own home where I choose the wall color.\n\n‚Ä¢Powerful, ahead-of-its-time innovations. Galaxy AI, enhanced camera capabilities (after configuration), DeX. I feel like I'm using the technologies of the future today.\n\n‚Ä¢Sense of uniqueness. I'm not \"one of the crowd.\" My choice is conscious and differs from the mainstream. This brings a certain intellectual satisfaction.\n\n‚Ä¢Small things that make life easier. A more convenient messenger, a better keyboard, no \"crutches\" for basic things (like listening to music from the browser).\n\n‚Ä¢System openness. The ability to install modded YouTube and YouTube Music apps, which works great.\n\n‚Ä¢Circle to Search. The on-screen search function works great.\n\n‚Ä¢Watch integration. Notifications from my device work on my watch, which was an important factor.\n\n‚Ä¢Step transfer. Steps from the phone are transferred to the watch, allowing me to see full activity statistics.\n\n‚Ä¢Browser control. The ability to uncheck \"open in built-in browser\" for news, which helps avoid ads.\n\n‚Ä¢Cons (The Harsh Truth):\n\n‚Ä¢Freedom requires work. Customization is not only joy but also a necessity. Sometimes this necessity turns into \"repair.\" When I have to fix basic functions (battery, sleep tracking) after an update, it's no longer \"customization\" but fixing manufacturer errors.\n\n‚Ä¢Fragility of innovations. The latest features can be \"raw\" and break. This undermines trust. I expect stability from a flagship but get beta testing for my own money.\n\n‚Ä¢Emotional isolation. The most significant drawback. I fall out of familiar family \"digital rituals.\" This creates a feeling of loneliness and makes me wonder if technological freedom is worth this emotional price.\n\n‚Ä¢Camera quality. Photos come out \"flat,\" without the depth or volume that iPhone has. Videos are also not top-notch. I want the phone to do this for me, not force me to \"play with photos.\" iPhone handles this, even the 13 Pro.\n\n‚Ä¢UI appearance. The iPhone's lock screen looks better.\n\n‚Ä¢Reminders and calendar. Reminder events don't appear in the calendar by default, and while there are workarounds, it feels like a \"crutch.\"\n\n‚Ä¢Weather app. The iPhone's weather app is more detailed; Samsung just redirects to a web page.\n\n‚Ä¢Passwords. The built-in password app doesn't always work on time or connect to save new passwords. I had to install Bitwarden.\n\n‚Ä¢Watch. Although notifications work, auto-tracking for cycling didn't start, and heart rate shows incorrectly during elliptical workouts.\n\n# Part II: The Main Conclusion I Reached\n\nI realized that my choice wasn't between two phones. It was a choice between two life priorities: personal technological freedom and seamless family integration.\n\nI left iPhone because I valued the first. I started to miss it because I underestimated the importance of the second.\n\nThe problem isn't that Samsung is bad and iPhone is good. The problem is that an ideal world where there is both absolute freedom and absolute integration with family on another platform does not exist. And each of us is forced to choose which of these two values is more important to us at a given moment in life.\n\nMy struggle is not an attempt to prove that Samsung is better. It's an attempt to find a way to \"build bridges\" between my new free world and the cozy \"digital home\" where my family remained. And I don't know yet if I will succeed.\n\nMy choice of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was wise, economically justified, and aligns with my desire for innovation and freedom. The only thing I need to do is give myself permission to fully transition to Samsung. Stop comparing and start enjoying my new device. True perfectionism is not demanding an ideal, but achieving maximum comfort with minimal expenditure of resources (time, money, nerves). That's exactly what I did.",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android üëã,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to¬†**WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is¬†**SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

    "selftext": "Compared to traditional Linux distros, Android is very restricted, the newer versions even more so, it is very hard to root too. So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android üëã,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to¬†**WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is¬†**SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Recently, I was searching for flip phone reviews and saw an article on the Vertu website. The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

They advertise that their case works with PixelSnap and even has product photos of it using a stand, but it's false advertising and their case doesn't work at all with PixelSnap accessories.\n\nThey also have a return policy of 30 days and when I reached out, their automated emailing system said it would be 24 hours before they would get back to me and that never happened. I ended up having to reach out to PayPal to investigate before doing a charge back and guess what? I finally got a response and they are having me pay for shipping the case back with me just putting a return number in the package. There's not real official return process outside of that \n\nTLDR: The Ghostek Pixel 10 Pro Fold case is a scam and doesn't work with PixelSnap.",

That I did not have the phone was always in a protecting cover. They wanted 150‚Ç¨. I couldn't even get more info, had 2 options. Pay for the repair or send the phone back to me. \n\nOf course I chose to send it back, I have not received any more information. It's been 10 days with no info. Today I finally got hold of someone at Google and they just said the same thing again and again. They will escalate the issue. Could not tell me where the phone is, if it is sent or not, if it is lost or not.

    "selftext": "Confession, I like analogue paper and pen or pencil. I find the kinesthetic aspect of handwriting helps me remember things or work things through. However this is not always available to me so I have to use my phone. Never satisfying as it never works as well as I need it to. \n\nNow I've had the Swype keyboards from earliest days on my Samsung galaxy s2 though various android phones too my P9 now. It got ok but then kind of lost the plot.\n\n I've tried the Google gesture typing. I've tried typing each letter and use autocorrect but jeez how many times do I have to make sure the language is English UK and it still passes English US spelling. How hard is it to remember to use grey, colour, etc??!!\n\nThen there's the gesture types of keyboards. The first one I used you did a loop over a letter you doubled snoop, loop, etc has a squiggle over the letter o. It worked years ago on older phones but it's been going wrong on my last two or three phones.\n\nThen there's the note taking app itself. It's so difficult to put in formatting to highlight say bullet points, underlining or highlighting. I've used basic notes through to onenote, and those competitors like evernote, keep, etc.\n\nSo my question is twofold, what is the best way to put notes down into the memory of your phone via an input method? Secondly, what is a really good and efficient note taking app that allows efficient ways to put thoughts or notes down with formatting to emphasis points as needed? \n\nThe first I am limited by not wanting voice input method. The second is limited by not wanting to spend that much on it. Also, little notebook isn't helpful for me as I want to not carry such things on the off chance I'm going to need it when there's a phone with me all the time. It's a phone based option I need \n\nI hope people have ideas to help me here ",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm facing a serious provisioning issue after an *official motherboard replacement* of my **Pixel 9 Pro (Hazel, 512 GB, original SKU: GEC77)**.\n\nMy phone unexpectedly stopped powering on in Sept. Since there‚Äôs no official Google service center in my country, I took it to a **Google-authorized service center in Singapore** during a business trip, where the staff replaced the motherboard.\n\nAfter the repair, I verified that the phone had **two valid IMEIs**, and the system is **Android 14**.\n\nHowever, after returning home and updating to **Android 16**, I suddenly received an email saying that my phone was **blacklisted** after several days of use.\n\nWhen I checked *#06#*, I was shocked to find that both IMEIs were **gone** ‚Äî replaced by a **single IMEI shared by both SIM slots**.\n\nI checked this new IMEI at [imeipro.info](https://www.imeipro.info/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and it was **indeed blacklisted**, listed as an **old Nokia device**.\n\nIn addition, my Google account now shows this phone as a **Verizon Pixel 9 Pro (Obsidian, 128 GB)** and system properties report the **SKU as ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù**\n\nBased on these findings, I believe the **replacement motherboard was never fully provisioned** ‚Äî the IMEIs were *soft-provisioned* during the repair but never *permanently burned* into the protected area. After the Android 16 OTA, a fallback IMEI used, which happens to be part of a **globally blacklisted** IMEI.\n\nI‚Äôm currently living in a country without a Google repair center and can‚Äôt travel again soon.  \nI‚Äôve already contacted Google Support, but they could only suggest visiting an authorized region in person.\n\nüëâ **Request:**  \nPlease escalate this as a *post-repair provisioning defect*.  \nI need confirmation that my case will remain eligible for a **delayed re-provisioning fix** (IMEI re-burn or change a new board) once I‚Äôm able to visit an official repair region.\n\nThanks to anyone from the **Google Repair or Pixel Hardware team** who can help flag this internally.",

    "selftext": "Last week Amazon had a deal on a Pixel Tablet for $249. \nGoogle store had it for $279. I contacted customer support to ask if they can match that price and they said: yes, buy it for $279 and after you receive it contact us back to get the difference refunded. \nSo I did. \nWhen I came back to claim the refund I was told that they cannot do it because it goes against their policy. \nWhat I'm upset about is not really $30, although that's not nothing, but the fact that I was simply lied to.\nI have that first conversation where I was promised the refund saved in writing. Presenting this transcript made no difference. Google refused to do absolutely anything to defuse this situation. \nIn the end I decided to return the tablet. That way Google is paying for shipping and refurbishing this tablet. I could care less at this point. \nSilver lining is that I got Galaxy Tab 10 lite instead and couldn't be happier. After over a decade of having nothing but Nexus and Pixel phones, headphones, and watches, I'm seriously looking forward to switching my entire ecosystem to Samsung. \nPixel feels very limited and closed off, dare is say: Apple-like. \nSamsung on the other hand reminds me of the good old times when I used to side load custom Android systems from XDA on rooted phones...\nFarewell Pixel.

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device‚Äôs screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A ‚Ç¨500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn‚Äôt I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google‚Äôs assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can‚Äôt even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen‚Äôs problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle‚Äôs written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don‚Äôt know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I‚Äôve been for months without my phone, and it‚Äôll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google‚Äôs abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this!

Not having much luck troubleshooting online, so if anyone has suggestions for either of these, help would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n1. No longer autocompleting Google searches. The phone asked if I wanted to sync information across devices, which I thought I'd done on my last one, so I said yes. Since agreeing to that, I no longer get autocomplete/suggested searches for Google searches (on my phone or on my laptop). When I start typing a question, all that comes up is my own previous queries. I do have the Trending Search setting turned on. I also tried turning on the personalized autocomplete setting, but all that did was start including websites I have saved to my bookmarks. I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, and restarting the phone, but nothing helps \n\n2. Discover won't go away. I've ensured the discover setting is off, but I still get an MSN-style list of news stories every time I open a new tab or spend time away from a tab (I come back to it, and the content is minimized with an option to pick back up where I left off... with an MSN-style list of stories beneath it). This one is still working correctly on my laptop (no stories shown to me there), but it's making me a bit nuts that it won't go away on the Pixel. Again here, I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, restarting the phone, to no avail.\n\nThanks again for any tips!",

My last phone was a Nothing 2a and the ones before that were primary Xiaomi phones. I never had a feeling of finishednes and high quality in my hands before. Although the Chip and the battery aren't the best on a or specifically this foldable, I always wanted one and went all in. I love everything about it and even the noticeable grace of this foldable is rather pleasant to me, I wanted a foldable, I got one, and it only reminds me of the fact that it's foldable.\n\nNow to the rent part of this post, the camera. I'm not a camera guy at all. The years before I didn't even transport or safe my pictures before changing the phone so I lost them every time. It was nothing memorable, just pictures of things to remind me of or something.\nBut with pixel, as it was considered the best phone camera for a long time, I thought, I'd look into it. It looks well done as everything does, but why can't I have the option to just shoot raw in the full, advertised 48mp?\n\nEvery other pixel phone has the option as far as I know and even Gemini told me that it's there, even after the proof of multiple screenshots. It just sounds like a no brainer to just not included the option because, why not.\nI read things online about pixel binging and all the different stuff, but after all, let the people decide what they want after they paid about 1800‚Ç¨ for a brand new phone with the camera of lasts gen, which, btw. had the option to select 48mp raw.\nI won't really need it, it just noticed it and got pissed off, because when I shoot pictures, I also want raw in full quality!\n\nWhy Google, just why? It's such a small thing and yet so dumb!\n\nIf I'm missing something, please correct me!",

The past two years I switched to the Apple echosystem.. I actually really liked it because it brought me back to the basics and it managed to handle basic task very very very good. Build quality felt amazing and the camera's were amazing. Because of some compatibilty issues with work I had to switch to Android. Again, choosing the Samsung over every other phone because of the looks and performance (on paper). \n\nI realised that the Apple Echosystem is very restrictive so I don't think I will ever switch back to Apple again.\n\nSo here I am... looking into a Pixel because it really gives me Apple vibes, as if Samsung and the iPhone had a baby.\n\nSo, I have a few questions before I consider taking the Pixel (I think I will wait for the Pixel 11):\n\n1. How is the camera? I really like taking Portrait pictures with my phone.  \n2. I had a few moments with the Pixel in a phone store but I couldn't get all out. But it looked to me like as if the widgets were very limited. I normally use the weather widget and the google agenda widget on my homescreen, the google agenda widget on the Samsung shows the full month with the daily tasks on the screen. It didnt look like Pixel has the same widget option. Does anyone know wether this is customizable?  \n3. How is gaming on the Pixel? I sometimes like to play games like Genshin Impact or Wuthering Waves\n\nThank you all",

    "title": "Pixel 9 gap between screen and frame + other potential issues, should I RMA?",
    "selftext": "Purchased a Pixel 9 about a month ago while on vacation in another country because my previous phone gave out. I noticed that there is a noticeable gap between the screen and the frame (enough to slot a piece of paper in), mostly uniform but slightly more pronounced at the bottom. The screen is also ever so slightly raised up from frame level.\n\nI didn't request for the device to be replaced because I was due to leave for the country I live in in just a few days, also because there was conflicting information online on whether this was normal or not.\n\nI also recently noticed that sometimes there's this faint cluster of pixels flashing green just under the selfie camera cutout (happens only on lower brightness settings), although I'm not sure if it's a hardware issue because I haven't seen it before, and I would definitely have noticed it before if it happened. I don't think it's dead/stuck pixels either because I don't see this happening when I view solid colours on the screen. Also since this phone has a Samsung display and not a BOE one, so the chances are lower. It's usually intermittent but it has stopped happening for now.\n\nI also understand that the gap probably won't void the water resistance because it's not the size of the gap that protects the device, rather the glue under the screen that attaches the display to the frame.\n\nAnyway, I contacted Google support today, and the support agent was more than willing to start an RMA when I asked for it, and said they'd send a brand new replacement. They also said they'd reject the RMA if they found physical damage on my current device.\n\nNow I'm just confused if it's worth attempting an RMA because the phone seems to be working fine and the gap probably doesn't affect water resistance. Besides, there's a couple hairline scratches on the screen, hard to find, but they're there. \n\nI'm afraid the RMA might get rejected because of this and apparently the whole process may take 5-10 business days. Don't want to have to factory reset my phone and wait so long only for it to get rejected.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Does anyone here have experience RMA-ing Pixels in Germany?\n\nPictures of how the gap looks: https://imgur.com/a/GUKiaK1 (zoom in for a better look)",

    "selftext": "It's been 3 weeks since my Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold started having multiple problems. It's been 3 weeks since I've been going back an forth with Google over this phone. I bought the phone brand new about 3 months ago and it has been great until these last 3 weeks. These are my problems. \n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The SIM reader stopped reading my SIM suddenly\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Front screen started glitching and sometimes won‚Äôt come on\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The phone overheats every time I use it\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The phone doesn‚Äôt receive charge when unfolded\n\n5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The camera app causes the phone to hang/crash\n\n6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If restarted, the phone may not come one until after 12 hours of repeated attempts at turning it on\n\n7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The phone just goes off on its own.\n\nAt first, Google had me send my phone to a google affiliated repair center who stated that the only problem with the phone was a small scratch and so the warranty had been removed. To fix the phone, I was given a quote for EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!!   \nI requested to have my phone returned and reached out to Google support again. This time, I was asked to take pictures of the phone and send it to the Google support again. The agent looked at the phone and stated that there were scratches to the phone's body, camera and inner screen. What he saw were left over stickies from the phone living in a Spigen body armor. \n\nI spoke to another agent who just cut the phone on me and did not call back. After speaking to 5 different Google support agents, one agent finally agreed to have me send the phone to Google's very own technicians in Warsaw Poland. Within a day, I received a report that there was a dent on the inner screen and that the warranty had been removed and to fix it, I HAD TO PAY A THIRD OF WHAT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!! No report was given with regards the 7 problems the phone had. \n\nIt's been 3 weeks since this problem started, 3 weeks without a phone, 3 weeks of putting my sim in my wife's phone just to check my notifications. 3 weeks of going around in circles with Google support. \n\nStill I haven't gotten any report about the 7 problems with the phone. Before this phone, I've been with Samsung for the past 17 years and I had no problems with their service whatsoever. Honestly I'm starting to regret leaving Samsung. \n\nAt the moment, I still do not have a phone, I'm still going back and forth with Google agents and so far, only one agent has brought up the option of a replacement and for that to occur, they have to check the warranty. \n\nPlease if you have experienced this problem or anything similar, what happens next? Will Google replace the phone? And if the answer is Yes (I hope), how long will it take. \n\nMy productivity has received a massive dent as a result of all this. I have had countless sleepless nights because of this. \n\nGoogle, please, this is not how to treat humans. This is totally unfair. ",

    "title": "My Pixel 9 Pro had a factory defect. Google's response left me speechless.",
    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device‚Äôs screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A ‚Ç¨500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn‚Äôt I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google‚Äôs assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can‚Äôt even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen‚Äôs problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle‚Äôs written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don‚Äôt know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I‚Äôve been for months without my phone, and it‚Äôll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google‚Äôs abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this! Best wishes. üôÇ",

They advertise that their case works with PixelSnap and even has product photos of it using a stand, but it's false advertising and their case doesn't work at all with PixelSnap accessories.\n\nThey also have a return policy of 30 days and when I reached out, their automated emailing system said it would be 24 hours before they would get back to me and that never happened. I ended up having to reach out to PayPal to investigate before doing a charge back and guess what? I finally got a response and they are having me pay for shipping the case back with me just putting a return number in the package. There's not real official return process outside of that \n\nTLDR: The Ghostek Pixel 10 Pro Fold case is a scam and doesn't work with PixelSnap.",

That I did not have the phone was always in a protecting cover. They wanted 150‚Ç¨. I couldn't even get more info, had 2 options. Pay for the repair or send the phone back to me. \n\nOf course I chose to send it back, I have not received any more information. It's been 10 days with no info. Today I finally got hold of someone at Google and they just said the same thing again and again. They will escalate the issue. Could not tell me where the phone is, if it is sent or not, if it is lost or not. Just that they will escalate and hopefully I will be contacted via e-mail within 48h.\n\nI loved my pixel 8, almost bought the new one. Instead am typing this on my Samsung now. ",

    "selftext": "I'm just sad, I've always been an android user and we always had more customization options than Apple. With every new update it seems our customization  options keep dwindling and the options for changing colors and themes gets worse and worse. For example with the new update I hate the semi-transparent background to my launcher and notification menu and I want it back to white but no option now. I used to use custom launchers back in the day but they seem more finicky and glitchy with newer phones. I loved Android because I could customize everything to fit my personality and now they're making us like Apple. It feels like the same pull to minimalism and sad beige aesthetic that is plaguing homes and businesses (looking at you McDonald's and Taco Bell) now a days. All personality is being sucked out. I want choices without needing a custom launcher. ",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm facing a serious provisioning issue after an *official motherboard replacement* of my **Pixel 9 Pro (Hazel, 512 GB, original SKU: GEC77)**.\n\nMy phone unexpectedly stopped powering on in Sept. Since there‚Äôs no official Google service center in my country, I took it to a **Google-authorized service center in Singapore** during a business trip, where the staff replaced the motherboard.\n\nAfter the repair, I verified that the phone had **two valid IMEIs**, and the system is **Android 14**.\n\nHowever, after returning home and updating to **Android 16**, I suddenly received an email saying that my phone was **blacklisted** after several days of use.\n\nWhen I checked *#06#*, I was shocked to find that both IMEIs were **gone** ‚Äî replaced by a **single IMEI shared by both SIM slots**.\n\nI checked this new IMEI at [imeipro.info](https://www.imeipro.info/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and it was **indeed blacklisted**, listed as an **old Nokia device**.\n\nIn addition, my Google account now shows this phone as a **Verizon Pixel 9 Pro (Obsidian, 128 GB)** and system properties report the **SKU as ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù**\n\nBased on these findings, I believe the **replacement motherboard was never fully provisioned** ‚Äî the IMEIs were *soft-provisioned* during the repair but never *permanently burned* into the protected area. After the Android 16 OTA, a fallback IMEI used, which happens to be part of a **globally blacklisted** IMEI.\n\nI‚Äôm currently living in a country without a Google repair center and can‚Äôt travel again soon.  \nI‚Äôve already contacted Google Support, but they could only suggest visiting an authorized region in person.\n\nüëâ **Request:**  \nPlease escalate this as a *post-repair provisioning defect*.  \nI need confirmation that my case will remain eligible for a **delayed re-provisioning fix** (IMEI re-burn or change a new board) once I‚Äôm able to visit an official repair region.\n\nThanks to anyone from the **Google Repair or Pixel Hardware team** who can help flag this internally.",

    "selftext": "Confession, I like analogue paper and pen or pencil. I find the kinesthetic aspect of handwriting helps me remember things or work things through. However this is not always available to me so I have to use my phone. Never satisfying as it never works as well as I need it to. \n\nNow I've had the Swype keyboards from earliest days on my Samsung galaxy s2 though various android phones too my P9 now. It got ok but then kind of lost the plot.\n\n I've tried the Google gesture typing. I've tried typing each letter and use autocorrect but jeez how many times do I have to make sure the language is English UK and it still passes English US spelling. How hard is it to remember to use grey, colour, etc??!!\n\nThen there's the gesture types of keyboards. The first one I used you did a loop over a letter you doubled snoop, loop, etc has a squiggle over the letter o. It worked years ago on older phones but it's been going wrong on my last two or three phones.\n\nThen there's the note taking app itself. It's so difficult to put in formatting to highlight say bullet points, underlining or highlighting. I've used basic notes through to onenote, and those competitors like evernote, keep, etc.\n\nSo my question is twofold, what is the best way to put notes down into the memory of your phone via an input method? Secondly, what is a really good and efficient note taking app that allows efficient ways to put thoughts or notes down with formatting to emphasis points as needed? \n\nThe first I am limited by not wanting voice input method. The second is limited by not wanting to spend that much on it. Also, little notebook isn't helpful for me as I want to not carry such things on the off chance I'm going to need it when there's a phone with me all the time. It's a phone based option I need \n\nI hope people have ideas to help me here ",

I was hoping someone here had a solution or even just a \"Yeah, we know\" kind of thing.. \n\nWhen I'm trying to watch videos on Reddit, trying to open the comments cuts the video playing in half, as if it's not scaling the UI properly to the resolution.\n\nOn discord, whenever I try to change the name of one my custom emotes, it opens and instantly closes the keyboard, again as if it's not allowing the UI to scale to the resolution.\n\nAs an online casino player, it's loading slots quickly, but then only displaying half of the screen diagonally (think of how you would cut a grilled cheese sandwich, can't post a picture here but I posted an example on my profile.) Some other slots stutter dramatically, and I've already tested switching between refresh rates.\n\nDoes anyone have anything that could help?

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device‚Äôs screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A ‚Ç¨500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn‚Äôt I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google‚Äôs assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can‚Äôt even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen‚Äôs problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle‚Äôs written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don‚Äôt know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I‚Äôve been for months without my phone, and it‚Äôll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google‚Äôs abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this!

I used to use custom launchers back in the day but they seem more finicky and glitchy with newer phones. I loved Android because I could customize everything to fit my personality and now they're making us like Apple. It feels like the same pull to minimalism and sad beige aesthetic that is plaguing homes and businesses (looking at you McDonald's and Taco Bell) now a days. All personality is being sucked out.

Since there‚Äôs no official Google service center in my country, I took it to a **Google-authorized service center in Singapore** during a business trip, where the staff replaced the motherboard.\n\nAfter the repair, I verified that the phone had **two valid IMEIs**, and the system is **Android 14**.\n\nHowever, after returning home and updating to **Android 16**, I suddenly received an email saying that my phone was **blacklisted** after several days of use.\n\nWhen I checked *#06#*, I was shocked to find that both IMEIs were **gone** ‚Äî replaced by a **single IMEI shared by both SIM slots**.\n\nI checked this new IMEI at [imeipro.info](https://www.imeipro.info/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and it was **indeed blacklisted**, listed as an **old Nokia device**.\n\nIn addition, my Google account now shows this phone as a **Verizon Pixel 9 Pro (Obsidian, 128 GB)** and system properties report the **SKU as ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù**\n\nBased on these findings, I believe the **replacement motherboard was never fully provisioned** ‚Äî the IMEIs were *soft-provisioned* during the repair but never *permanently burned* into the protected area. After the Android 16 OTA, a fallback IMEI used, which happens to be part of a **globally blacklisted** IMEI.\n\nI‚Äôm currently living in a country without a Google repair center and can‚Äôt travel again soon.  \nI‚Äôve already contacted Google Support, but they could only suggest visiting an authorized region in person.\n\nüëâ **Request:**  \nPlease escalate this as a *post-repair provisioning defect*.  \nI need confirmation that my case will remain eligible for a **delayed re-provisioning fix** (IMEI re-burn or change a new board) once I‚Äôm able to visit an official repair region.\n\nThanks to anyone from the **Google Repair or Pixel Hardware team** who can help flag this internally.",

However this is not always available to me so I have to use my phone. Never satisfying as it never works as well as I need it to. \n\nNow I've had the Swype keyboards from earliest days on my Samsung galaxy s2 though various android phones too my P9 now. It got ok but then kind of lost the plot.\n\n I've tried the Google gesture typing. I've tried typing each letter and use autocorrect but jeez how many times do I have to make sure the language is English UK and it still passes English US spelling. How hard is it to remember to use grey, colour, etc??!!\n\nThen there's the gesture types of keyboards. The first one I used you did a loop over a letter you doubled snoop, loop, etc has a squiggle over the letter o. It worked years ago on older phones but it's been going wrong on my last two or three phones.\n\nThen there's the note taking app itself. It's so difficult to put in formatting to highlight say bullet points, underlining or highlighting. I've used basic notes through to onenote, and those competitors like evernote, keep, etc.\n\nSo my question is twofold, what is the best way to put notes down into the memory of your phone via an input method? Secondly, what is a really good and efficient note taking app that allows efficient ways to put thoughts or notes down with formatting to emphasis points as needed? \n\nThe first I am limited by not wanting voice input method. The second is limited by not wanting to spend that much on it. Also, little notebook isn't helpful for me as I want to not carry such things on the off chance I'm going to need it when there's a phone with me all the time. It's a phone based option I need \n\nI hope people have ideas to help me here ",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion.

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve never been a big fan of Samsung electronics. Didn‚Äôt have anything against them per se, but I just wasn‚Äôt often impressed by them. I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I‚Äôm absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I‚Äôm there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this sound bar isn‚Äôt quite on the same level as my old system was, but it‚Äôs probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Samsung did a lot of good with this phone. Like a lot. They made the cover screen a lot better than what it used to be, and I can do and see a lot more because of that. They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "selftext": "Upgrading from a Note 10+ (loved the phone but half the screen no longer reacts to touch, only s pen unfortunately) decided to trial run both the s24 ultra (1TB) & S25+ (512GB) before finalizing which to keep, the other goes back. Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

I really wish I could've found a good reason to keep it because I loved the flip factor, I can run with it and go hiking without feeling a big bulk bouncing around in my pocket. My main complaints were the short battery life and longer time to charge, camera quality, and phone temperature during regular use/charging (it gets really warm on the outter screen). Maybe sometime in the future Samsung will bring the Z series closer to the ultra given their higher pricing. ",

    "title": "Pairing galaxy watch with xiaomi China rom",
    "selftext": "I recently bought a new Xiaomi 17 Pro Max (without any options, it's a China ROM) and I am the owner of a global version Galaxy Watch 6. The question arose of how to connect them to the phone, since the standard connection via the Galaxy Wearable app from the Google Play Market didn't work. I kept getting an error that the connection failed or that the phone was not supported. So, for people like me, I'm writing this guide, since I managed to do it, and I haven't found another guide like this on the internet. (At any stage, you may encounter difficulties with permission to install applications, but I hope you can handle this yourself <3 )  \n1. This is probably optional, I haven't tested without this step: Resets the watch settings;  \n2. You need to download the Tencent App Store;  \n3. Next, download the following applications from the Tencent App Store: Galaxy Wearable and Wear OS by Google;  \n4. Download the required version of the galaxy plugin from the Play Market: for me it was Galaxy Watch6 plugin.  \n5. Go to the settings of all 3 applications and set them to autostart in the battery settings \"No restrictions\", and in the permissions settings you can give all access. I don‚Äôt remember exactly, but \"Acess list of installed apps\" and \"Open new window shile running in the background\" it was enough if someone doesn‚Äôt want to give everything;  \n6. Go to Bluetooth settings and connect the watch;  \n7. In Wear OS, you should see two buttons. One for Wear OS watch, And the second one with text \"Have a Samsung watch?\" with a button \"Open Galaxy Wearable\" <- you need this button. Galaxy Wearable should open and show your Bluetooth connected watch. Start connecting.  \n8. **SKIP ALL THE STEPS OF LOGGING INTO YOUR SAMSUNG AND GOOGLE ACCOUNTS!!**! You can do it later.  \nP.S. Sometimes, during the setup process, everything might break at some percentage. Don't panic, and try again. I usually get it right on the second try.",

    "selftext": "Hello redditors!\n\nI have previously asked in this community if it's worth purchasing the Galaxy Watch 4 LTE 44mm refurbished for around 80$, and most people said I should I go search for an another model at around the same price. So while looking today, I found a lot of Galaxy Watch 7 40mm LTE listings for around 100$ - 120$. My question is if it's worth getting it for that price? One seller even said it's almost brand new, and it's been used for only 5 days, another said it's been rarely used. And for the price tag, plus the LTE feature, and being a relatively new flagship model (last year is was a flagship watch), I think it's worth to go for it. What do you guys think? Or should I get it, or should I go for Watch 6, 5, or an older model?\n\nMy question is if it's worth getting the Watch 7 LTE 40mm for this price tag? Is the battery relatively good, especially with LTE ON? Or does the Galaxy Watch 4 44mm or other older watches perform better? What about the experience, is it lag-free, what sensors does it have compared to older models, and why should I get it over an older model? And will it be any difference if using it with a Galaxy phone or not? And, jumping from a Galaxy Fit 3 to this watch would be a major difference? And if anything, how much does a battery swap cost?\n\nThanks in advance for helping me out!\n\n  \nEDIT 1: I forgot to mention, does this watch have comfortable straps and a comfortable design compared to older models?",

Under Sounds and Vibrations, I see 2 relevant settings:  \n\\- \"Vibration\" (Longs/Short and Light/Strong)  \n\\- \"Notification Vibration\"\n\nFrom my understanding the latter one is the vibration pattern and the former one is the Intensity controls. But does it (\"Vibration\") control the intensity of only the notifications, or something else as well as it doesn't exclusively mention notifications?\n\nBesides what controls the Vibration settings for \"Phone Alarms\" - are they treated like notifications as they are originally from the phone? Is it independent of the controls mentioned above? If yes, how is Vibration settings for \"Phone Alarms\" controlled - the intensity, pattern and even ON/OFF?\n\nThanks.",

    "title": "Pairing galaxy watch with xiaomi China rom",
    "selftext": "I recently bought a new Xiaomi 17 Pro Max (without any options, it's a China ROM) and I am the owner of a global version Galaxy Watch 6. The question arose of how to connect them to the phone, since the standard connection via the Galaxy Wearable app from the Google Play Market didn't work. I kept getting an error that the connection failed or that the phone was not supported. So, for people like me, I'm writing this guide, since I managed to do it, and I haven't found another guide like this on the internet. (At any stage, you may encounter difficulties with permission to install applications, but I hope you can handle this yourself <3 )  \n1. This is probably optional, I haven't tested without this step: Resets the watch settings;  \n2. You need to download the Tencent App Store;  \n3. Next, download the following applications from the Tencent App Store: Galaxy Wearable and Wear OS by Google;  \n4. Download the required version of the galaxy plugin from the Play Market: for me it was Galaxy Watch6 plugin.  \n5. Go to the settings of all 3 applications and set them to autostart in the battery settings \"No restrictions\", and in the permissions settings you can give all access. I don‚Äôt remember exactly, but \"Acess list of installed apps\" and \"Open new window shile running in the background\" it was enough if someone doesn‚Äôt want to give everything;  \n6. Go to Bluetooth settings and connect the watch;  \n7. In Wear OS, you should see two buttons. One for Wear OS watch, And the second one with text \"Have a Samsung watch?\" with a button \"Open Galaxy Wearable\" <- you need this button. Galaxy Wearable should open and show your Bluetooth connected watch. Start connecting.  \n8. **SKIP ALL THE STEPS OF LOGGING INTO YOUR SAMSUNG AND GOOGLE ACCOUNTS!!**! You can do it later.  \nP.S. Sometimes, during the setup process, everything might break at some percentage. Don't panic, and try again. I usually get it right on the second try.",

    "selftext": "I recently bought a new Xiaomi 17 Pro Max (without any options, it's a China ROM) and I am the owner of a global version Galaxy Watch 6. The question arose of how to connect them to the phone, since the standard connection via the Galaxy Wearable app from the Google Play Market didn't work. I kept getting an error that the connection failed or that the phone was not supported. So, for people like me, I'm writing this guide, since I managed to do it, and I haven't found another guide like this on the internet. (At any stage, you may encounter difficulties with permission to install applications, but I hope you can handle this yourself <3 )  \n1. This is probably optional, I haven't tested without this step: Resets the watch settings;  \n2. You need to download the Tencent App Store;  \n3. Next, download the following applications from the Tencent App Store: Galaxy Wearable and Wear OS by Google;  \n4. Download the required version of the galaxy plugin from the Play Market: for me it was Galaxy Watch6 plugin.  \n5. Go to the settings of all 3 applications and set them to autostart in the battery settings \"No restrictions\", and in the permissions settings you can give all access. I don‚Äôt remember exactly, but \"Acess list of installed apps\" and \"Open new window shile running in the background\" it was enough if someone doesn‚Äôt want to give everything;  \n6. Go to Bluetooth settings and connect the watch;  \n7. In Wear OS, you should see two buttons. One for Wear OS watch, And the second one with text \"Have a Samsung watch?\" with a button \"Open Galaxy Wearable\" <- you need this button. Galaxy Wearable should open and show your Bluetooth connected watch. Start connecting.  \n8. **SKIP ALL THE STEPS OF LOGGING INTO YOUR SAMSUNG AND GOOGLE ACCOUNTS!!**! You can do it later.  \nP.S. Sometimes, during the setup process, everything might break at some percentage. Don't panic, and try again. I usually get it right on the second try.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI‚Äôve been troubleshooting my HP Omen 17-cb0040nr (2019, i7-9750H + RTX 2070 + 144 Hz G-Sync panel) for years, and it‚Äôs finally reaching a weird, half-alive state. Here‚Äôs the full story in chronological order.\n\nüïê 2019 ‚Äì Early 2020\n\nLaptop worked great for the first ~6 months.\n\nHeavy gaming (Apex Legends, etc.) pushed GPU temps to 80‚Äì85 ¬∞C.\n\nThe display would suddenly go black, sound would freeze, and I had to force shutdown.\n\nAfter cooling down, it would boot normally again.\n\nLag when plugged in: Occasionally, since purchase, performance would drop badly until I unplugged and re-plugged the charger, then FPS would instantly recover.\n\nüßπ Mid 2020 ‚Äì 2021\n\nFound dust clogging the cooling system; cleaned it thoroughly.\n\nTemps improved and random shutdowns reduced.\n\nAround 2021, HP UEFI Diagnostics flagged a ‚ÄúVideo Memory [F] failure‚Äù ‚Üí confirmed early VRAM instability on the GPU.\n\nFrom this point onward, the GPU remained functional but unstable under high load.\n\n‚ö° 2022 ‚Äì 2024\n\nContinued gaming on medium settings; GPU stayed below 78 ¬∞C.\n\nOccasional driver crashes or screen flickers.\n\nNo major shutdowns, but instability kept creeping back.\n\nüîã 2025\n\nHP Smart reported a ‚Äúblown charge-state fuse‚Äù ‚Äî battery stopped charging completely. Removed the battery since this. I get CMOS error and I press enter to see boot (hp omen logo).\n\nBegan using the laptop plugged in only, like a desktop.\n\nThe power button started blinking continuously even during normal operation ‚Üí likely due to the battery-circuit fault.\n\nSystem still booted and worked fine on AC.\n\nüí• Current State (2025 October)\n\nThe internal laptop display stays black most of the time (backlight faintly glows).\n\nExternal 200 Hz monitor (HDMI) works well ‚Äî I can even play Apex Legends for hours on medium settings with GPU VRAM capped to 4 GB.\n\n\nNVIDIA Control Panel won‚Äôt open, though the RTX 2070 is visible in Device Manager and Task Manager.\n\nBoot behavior:\n\nExternal monitor connected via HDMI.\n\nPress power ‚Üí CMOS error occurs(sometimes it wont be displayed in either of the displays, occurs when I start the laptop after a long time, like half a day etc) (I press enter to proceed with booting, as one can see if windows is booted or not by pressing caps lock to see if the button lights are working or not) \n\nWhat happens next in a successful boot is, the powee button light goes off and turns on in like 2 sec, I press entee agan and the same cycle happens for one more time (2 to 3 timez at max), and then the external display connected (sometimes internal display too) gets hp omen logo boot screen. Post this, if windows login acreen comes, in atleast one of the displays, it is a successful boot. Else, I have to force shutdown the pc and start again\n\nSystem reboots itself once or twice.\n\nHP Omen logo appears ‚Äî almost always on the external monitor.\n\nDisplay outcomes (approx. 10 boots):\n\n5 times ‚Üí only external monitor shows the Windows login screen, laptop panel stays blank.\n\n1 time ‚Üí both monitors work correctly and internal 144 Hz panel shows Windows login.\n\n4 times ‚Üí internal panel = black, external = HP logo only (no Windows output). I can still log in blindly and shut down via Alt + F4, so the system is running headless.\n\nWhen I try to ‚ÄúDuplicate display,‚Äù both displays drop to 1024√ó768 @ 60 Hz, the only modes Windows detects for the laptop screen.\n\nüîé Current Symptoms Summary\n\nGPU and HDMI output work reliably; internal panel almost dead.\n\nCMOS error on every cold boot ‚Üí BIOS resets device detection.\n\nHP Diagnostics previously confirmed Video Memory failure.\n\nüí≠ My Suspicions\n\nPartial GPU VRAM degradation or faulty eDP (output to internal panel).\n\nPossible loose or damaged eDP cable/panel connector.\n\nWeak CMOS battery causing repeated re-detection and boot loops.\n\nBattery-charging fuse blown (confirmed), forcing AC-only operation.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è What Still Works\n\nExternal monitor gaming at 200 Hz for hours.\n\nAll USB, audio, and Ethernet functions.\n\nInternal panel sometimes returns to life for one boot, then fails again.\n\n‚ùìLooking for Advice\n\nHas anyone seen an RTX-series GPU that works fine externally but fails internally?\n\nCould a failing VRAM or eDP transmitter cause intermittent CMOS errors?\n\nIs a GPU reball worth it on this board (L50873-006), or should I hunt for a replacement motherboard?\n\nAny way to disable the internal panel entirely to speed up boot?\n\nAny insights or similar experiences would really help.\nThanks for reading ‚Äî posting this so future Omen owners facing half-dead GPUs can find a full timeline too.",

I have an Android phone.\n* I store my files on both Google Drive and OneDrive (and don't really store things locally, but I use the sync apps).\n\nI'm drawn to the MacBook Air due to it's battery life and reliability. But I'm drawn to the Surface due to it's familiarity and customisability. There are a few Windows features I use regularly, and I don't know if I could give them up:\n\n* Ability to copy and paste file paths in Explorer.\n* Snipping Tool.\n* The task bar (each window having it's own icon, being able to hover over the icons and see previews).\n* Easily snapping windows on the screen using keyboard shortcuts.\n* Centre clicking the scroll wheel to close tabs/open links.\n\n**So, what do you think? I'm thinking Surface Laptop, but I'm worried about longevity (mostly battery life).**\n\nThankyou!",

After I gave it to the repair shop they started taking too long and when I asked for updates they said they needed to import some pieces and that's what was taking too long. Unbeknownst to me during these weeks they went on a minor holiday, despite the fact I told them I had a thesis to write and that in the meantime they could give me back my laptop temporarily. Fed up with the waiting, I demanded that to be returned, only for them to disassemble it the same morning I came back to take it and asking me for one more day. After one day I took it back and now it doesn't start anymore, the BIOS doesn't start, and Windows recovery USB doesn't work either. I looked inside but nothing has been stolen. What could have they done with it?(They asked for my password) How can I at least salvage the situation?",

    "selftext": "So as the title implies, for some reason GHelper thinks HDR is active, even though my system doesn't even support it (Asus ROG Strix G18 (2024)). On top of that, I'm getting an issue commonly experienced when HDR is, in fact, on; my cursor is overexposed (washed out, light colors), except when dragging windows. First I thought it was Nvidia's fault since it only occurred when I was on the NVIDIA GPU only display mode, but after another restart it started happening when I'm on Optimus as well...\n\nThis led me to think that something is tricking my system into thinking it's using HDR, but I can't for the life of me figure out what that something is. I've checked everything that comes to mind, both Nvidia's settings and my Windows settings. In Windows settings it is clearly stated that only HDR Video is supported, but \"Use HDR\" isn't. In the Nvidia settings the only HDR-related setting that I can find is HDR under RTX Video Enhancement, but whether I turn it on or off does not make any difference.\n\nIf anyone knows how to handle this, I'd be pleased to receive feedback.",

The Zenbook lineup has many variants. I really liked the A14, but it‚Äôs quite expensive and comes with the Snapdragon X Elite chip, which isn‚Äôt compatible with Premiere Pro. There are also other variants with Intel Core Ultra processors, but I‚Äôve heard they tend to overheat, and I‚Äôm unsure how they perform.\n\nRight now, I‚Äôm leaning towards the MacBook since I use one myself and would like to gradually get him into the Apple ecosystem. However, he‚Äôs been using Windows for years, so switching to macOS might be a bit challenging for him. Unfortunately, none of the Windows laptops seem to offer the same premium experience as the MacBook at this price range.\n\nI really want to get the best option for him, but I‚Äôm so confused about what to choose. Please let me know what you think I should go for between these two, or if there are any other good alternatives you‚Äôd recommend.\n\nThank you!",

My main uses will be homework, basic stuff like Tryhackme, If possible Ill dual boot a linux distro for practice but if I can't Ill use an emulator. \n\nMy question is, is this worth it for the price I'm paying or are there better options out there? Im a broke teenager so my budget is between ¬£90 and ¬£150, but the closer to the left end the happier my wallet will be.\n\nEdit: Just realised theres a suggest a laptop sub but I still need advice, will be reposting there soon",

The mute microphone button had also been turned on for some reason and would not turn off. I force shut down the laptop and when I tried to turn it back on I was met with a power LED (no flashing, just static) but no display. My keyboard would flash as though the laptop was being turned on but no boot on the display.  \n\nI‚Äôve tried resetting the graphics card using win+ctrl+shift+b and doing a hard reboot by holding the power button in for 30 seconds and nothing has worked.

I only opened this up again since I need a laptop for school this yr and when I did, I was reminded of why I hated this thing. It's slow, laggy, and didn't even do me well over the yrs. It was constant pain. It's got lots of great memories but I think I have to let go already. But to let go means to get a new one. The problem is: I don't have money. To be in a country like mine and being a broke teenager, it's almost impossible to save up money fast enough to still get my school work done. Right now I'm mostly borrowing my mother's laptop and it's just not consistent because she needs it for her work too and our schedule lines up and I end up never being able to use it. Anyways my whish for this Christmas is a new laptop so I could do my school work and possibly have an online job.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm hoping some of you may have some insight between the screens on these laptops, Lenovo T450 with panel N140bge-ea3 (1366x768) compared to Lenovo T470 with panel N140HCA-EAB (1080p), and what may be the cause of the additional eye strain.\n\nSince I switched to the T470 recently I've started experiencing significant eye strain. Previously I could use the T450 pretty much all day without any discomfort, but now after using the T470 for just a few hours my eyes hurt like crazy along with a massive headache. This is regardless of screen brightness. I've also disabled anything in Intel graphics control panel like noise reduction, color enhancement, etc. that might be messing with things. I've used plenty of other 1080p or 4k devices for prolonged periods so I don't believe the resolution is related.\n\nI've compared the panels on panelook ([https://www.panelook.com/modelcompare.php?ids=17574,30063](https://www.panelook.com/modelcompare.php?ids=17574,30063)) and I see they have different PWM frequencies and duty cycles, but I don't know enough about monitors/panels to know for sure if this could be the culprit or if something else is more likely.\n\nThe T470 / N140HCA-EAB has a duty cycle of 1\\~100%, and a PWM frequency of 100(min) \\~ 500(Max) Hz, while the T450 / N140bge-ea3 has a duty cycle 5\\~100% and PWM frequency of 190 (min) \\~ 2K(Max) Hz. There are also some other differences like slightly higher nits and contrast ratio.\n\nI'd like to replace the panel with something that's 1080p still but doesn't hurt my eyes so much. In the meantime I've been using F.lux aggressively and that seems to help some, although I never needed it on the old laptop. I would greatly appreciate any insight or experiences you might have.\n\n  \nThanks",

I also want a laptop that will hold up well and not be outdated the moment I open the box.\n\nThe biggest issue I'm having is finding what looks to be a good laptop for a good price on Amazon, only for it to have several 1-star reviews, saying it blue-screened shortly after purchase. I also find laptops that I am unable to find/build on the manufacturers website, which makes me think that it's either outdated or crap.\n\nI'm not looking to spend a ton of money, so I'd like to find a reliable laptop for perhaps around $600, but can go higher if I'd be getting a great machine for the price. I also know Black Friday is a month away, so I can wait for price drops, if necessary. \n\nThanks in advance!",

It was constant pain. It's got lots of great memories but I think I have to let go already. But to let go means to get a new one. The problem is: I don't have money. To be in a country like mine and being a broke teenager, it's almost impossible to save up money fast enough to still get my school work done. Right now I'm mostly borrowing my mother's laptop and it's just not consistent because she needs it for her work too and our schedule lines up and I end up never being able to use it. Anyways my whish for this Christmas is a new laptop so I could do my school work and possibly have an online job.",

As of today it‚Äôs practically unusable with a battery that lasts about three hours (all I ever use it for is study and video calls), it also takes ages to charge and overheats if I join a meeting, open more than a few tabs, or try to charge it while using it.\n\nBeing autistic I really don‚Äôt want to have to learn a new system(I‚Äôm terrible with tech) I know MacBooks have controversial reputation though I‚Äôm not sure why. If I were to buy the same make and model second hand (with a new battery) would it last me at all? Or do I need to bite the bullet and get a reliable Lenovo or something?\n\nEdit: I only do video calls a couple of times a week, usually less. I use my laptop in three one hour blocks a day to prevent it from overheating and turn it off (not sleep mode) in between so it cools down.",

I have an Android phone.\n* I store my files on both Google Drive and OneDrive (and don't really store things locally, but I use the sync apps).\n\nI'm drawn to the MacBook Air due to it's battery life and reliability. But I'm drawn to the Surface due to it's familiarity and customisability. There are a few Windows features I use regularly, and I don't know if I could give them up:\n\n* Ability to copy and paste file paths in Explorer.\n* Snipping Tool.\n* The task bar (each window having it's own icon, being able to hover over the icons and see previews).\n* Easily snapping windows on the screen using keyboard shortcuts.\n* Centre clicking the scroll wheel to close tabs/open links.\n\n**So, what do you think? I'm thinking Surface Laptop, but I'm worried about longevity (mostly battery life).**\n\nThankyou!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI‚Äôve been troubleshooting my HP Omen 17-cb0040nr (2019, i7-9750H + RTX 2070 + 144 Hz G-Sync panel) for years, and it‚Äôs finally reaching a weird, half-alive state. Here‚Äôs the full story in chronological order.\n\nüïê 2019 ‚Äì Early 2020\n\nLaptop worked great for the first ~6 months.\n\nHeavy gaming (Apex Legends, etc.) pushed GPU temps to 80‚Äì85 ¬∞C.\n\nThe display would suddenly go black, sound would freeze, and I had to force shutdown.\n\nAfter cooling down, it would boot normally again.\n\nLag when plugged in: Occasionally, since purchase, performance would drop badly until I unplugged and re-plugged the charger, then FPS would instantly recover.\n\nüßπ Mid 2020 ‚Äì 2021\n\nFound dust clogging the cooling system; cleaned it thoroughly.\n\nTemps improved and random shutdowns reduced.\n\nAround 2021, HP UEFI Diagnostics flagged a ‚ÄúVideo Memory [F] failure‚Äù ‚Üí confirmed early VRAM instability on the GPU.\n\nFrom this point onward, the GPU remained functional but unstable under high load.\n\n‚ö° 2022 ‚Äì 2024\n\nContinued gaming on medium settings; GPU stayed below 78 ¬∞C.\n\nOccasional driver crashes or screen flickers.\n\nNo major shutdowns, but instability kept creeping back.\n\nüîã 2025\n\nHP Smart reported a ‚Äúblown charge-state fuse‚Äù ‚Äî battery stopped charging completely. Removed the battery since this. I get CMOS error and I press enter to see boot (hp omen logo).\n\nBegan using the laptop plugged in only, like a desktop.\n\nThe power button started blinking continuously even during normal operation ‚Üí likely due to the battery-circuit fault.\n\nSystem still booted and worked fine on AC.\n\nüí• Current State (2025 October)\n\nThe internal laptop display stays black most of the time (backlight faintly glows).\n\nExternal 200 Hz monitor (HDMI) works well ‚Äî I can even play Apex Legends for hours on medium settings with GPU VRAM capped to 4 GB.\n\n\nNVIDIA Control Panel won‚Äôt open, though the RTX 2070 is visible in Device Manager and Task Manager.\n\nBoot behavior:\n\nExternal monitor connected via HDMI.\n\nPress power ‚Üí CMOS error occurs(sometimes it wont be displayed in either of the displays, occurs when I start the laptop after a long time, like half a day etc) (I press enter to proceed with booting, as one can see if windows is booted or not by pressing caps lock to see if the button lights are working or not) \n\nWhat happens next in a successful boot is, the powee button light goes off and turns on in like 2 sec, I press entee agan and the same cycle happens for one more time (2 to 3 timez at max), and then the external display connected (sometimes internal display too) gets hp omen logo boot screen. Post this, if windows login acreen comes, in atleast one of the displays, it is a successful boot. Else, I have to force shutdown the pc and start again\n\nSystem reboots itself once or twice.\n\nHP Omen logo appears ‚Äî almost always on the external monitor.\n\nDisplay outcomes (approx. 10 boots):\n\n5 times ‚Üí only external monitor shows the Windows login screen, laptop panel stays blank.\n\n1 time ‚Üí both monitors work correctly and internal 144 Hz panel shows Windows login.\n\n4 times ‚Üí internal panel = black, external = HP logo only (no Windows output). I can still log in blindly and shut down via Alt + F4, so the system is running headless.\n\nWhen I try to ‚ÄúDuplicate display,‚Äù both displays drop to 1024√ó768 @ 60 Hz, the only modes Windows detects for the laptop screen.\n\nüîé Current Symptoms Summary\n\nGPU and HDMI output work reliably; internal panel almost dead.\n\nCMOS error on every cold boot ‚Üí BIOS resets device detection.\n\nHP Diagnostics previously confirmed Video Memory failure.\n\nüí≠ My Suspicions\n\nPartial GPU VRAM degradation or faulty eDP (output to internal panel).\n\nPossible loose or damaged eDP cable/panel connector.\n\nWeak CMOS battery causing repeated re-detection and boot loops.\n\nBattery-charging fuse blown (confirmed), forcing AC-only operation.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è What Still Works\n\nExternal monitor gaming at 200 Hz for hours.\n\nAll USB, audio, and Ethernet functions.\n\nInternal panel sometimes returns to life for one boot, then fails again.\n\n‚ùìLooking for Advice\n\nHas anyone seen an RTX-series GPU that works fine externally but fails internally?\n\nCould a failing VRAM or eDP transmitter cause intermittent CMOS errors?\n\nIs a GPU reball worth it on this board (L50873-006), or should I hunt for a replacement motherboard?\n\nAny way to disable the internal panel entirely to speed up boot?\n\nAny insights or similar experiences would really help.\nThanks for reading ‚Äî posting this so future Omen owners facing half-dead GPUs can find a full timeline too.",

After I gave it to the repair shop they started taking too long and when I asked for updates they said they needed to import some pieces and that's what was taking too long. Unbeknownst to me during these weeks they went on a minor holiday, despite the fact I told them I had a thesis to write and that in the meantime they could give me back my laptop temporarily. Fed up with the waiting, I demanded that to be returned, only for them to disassemble it the same morning I came back to take it and asking me for one more day. After one day I took it back and now it doesn't start anymore, the BIOS doesn't start, and Windows recovery USB doesn't work either. I looked inside but nothing has been stolen. What could have they done with it?(They asked for my password) How can I at least salvage the situation?",

    "selftext": "So as the title implies, for some reason GHelper thinks HDR is active, even though my system doesn't even support it (Asus ROG Strix G18 (2024)). On top of that, I'm getting an issue commonly experienced when HDR is, in fact, on; my cursor is overexposed (washed out, light colors), except when dragging windows. First I thought it was Nvidia's fault since it only occurred when I was on the NVIDIA GPU only display mode, but after another restart it started happening when I'm on Optimus as well...\n\nThis led me to think that something is tricking my system into thinking it's using HDR, but I can't for the life of me figure out what that something is. I've checked everything that comes to mind, both Nvidia's settings and my Windows settings. In Windows settings it is clearly stated that only HDR Video is supported, but \"Use HDR\" isn't. In the Nvidia settings the only HDR-related setting that I can find is HDR under RTX Video Enhancement, but whether I turn it on or off does not make any difference.\n\nIf anyone knows how to handle this, I'd be pleased to receive feedback.",

The Zenbook lineup has many variants. I really liked the A14, but it‚Äôs quite expensive and comes with the Snapdragon X Elite chip, which isn‚Äôt compatible with Premiere Pro. There are also other variants with Intel Core Ultra processors, but I‚Äôve heard they tend to overheat, and I‚Äôm unsure how they perform.\n\nRight now, I‚Äôm leaning towards the MacBook since I use one myself and would like to gradually get him into the Apple ecosystem. However, he‚Äôs been using Windows for years, so switching to macOS might be a bit challenging for him. Unfortunately, none of the Windows laptops seem to offer the same premium experience as the MacBook at this price range.\n\nI really want to get the best option for him, but I‚Äôm so confused about what to choose. Please let me know what you think I should go for between these two, or if there are any other good alternatives you‚Äôd recommend.\n\nThank you!",

I've never bought a laptop on my own and don't really know much about computers, so any help would be great. Thanks!",

It was constant pain. It's got lots of great memories but I think I have to let go already. But to let go means to get a new one. The problem is: I don't have money. To be in a country like mine and being a broke teenager, it's almost impossible to save up money fast enough to still get my school work done. Right now I'm mostly borrowing my mother's laptop and it's just not consistent because she needs it for her work too and our schedule lines up and I end up never being able to use it. Anyways my whish for this Christmas is a new laptop so I could do my school work and possibly have an online job.",

I have an Android phone.\n* I store my files on both Google Drive and OneDrive (and don't really store things locally, but I use the sync apps).\n\nI'm drawn to the MacBook Air due to it's battery life and reliability. But I'm drawn to the Surface due to it's familiarity and customisability. There are a few Windows features I use regularly, and I don't know if I could give them up:\n\n* Ability to copy and paste file paths in Explorer.\n* Snipping Tool.\n* The task bar (each window having it's own icon, being able to hover over the icons and see previews).\n* Easily snapping windows on the screen using keyboard shortcuts.\n* Centre clicking the scroll wheel to close tabs/open links.\n\n**So, what do you think? I'm thinking Surface Laptop, but I'm worried about longevity (mostly battery life).**\n\nThankyou!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI‚Äôve been troubleshooting my HP Omen 17-cb0040nr (2019, i7-9750H + RTX 2070 + 144 Hz G-Sync panel) for years, and it‚Äôs finally reaching a weird, half-alive state. Here‚Äôs the full story in chronological order.\n\nüïê 2019 ‚Äì Early 2020\n\nLaptop worked great for the first ~6 months.\n\nHeavy gaming (Apex Legends, etc.) pushed GPU temps to 80‚Äì85 ¬∞C.\n\nThe display would suddenly go black, sound would freeze, and I had to force shutdown.\n\nAfter cooling down, it would boot normally again.\n\nLag when plugged in: Occasionally, since purchase, performance would drop badly until I unplugged and re-plugged the charger, then FPS would instantly recover.\n\nüßπ Mid 2020 ‚Äì 2021\n\nFound dust clogging the cooling system; cleaned it thoroughly.\n\nTemps improved and random shutdowns reduced.\n\nAround 2021, HP UEFI Diagnostics flagged a ‚ÄúVideo Memory [F] failure‚Äù ‚Üí confirmed early VRAM instability on the GPU.\n\nFrom this point onward, the GPU remained functional but unstable under high load.\n\n‚ö° 2022 ‚Äì 2024\n\nContinued gaming on medium settings; GPU stayed below 78 ¬∞C.\n\nOccasional driver crashes or screen flickers.\n\nNo major shutdowns, but instability kept creeping back.\n\nüîã 2025\n\nHP Smart reported a ‚Äúblown charge-state fuse‚Äù ‚Äî battery stopped charging completely. Removed the battery since this. I get CMOS error and I press enter to see boot (hp omen logo).\n\nBegan using the laptop plugged in only, like a desktop.\n\nThe power button started blinking continuously even during normal operation ‚Üí likely due to the battery-circuit fault.\n\nSystem still booted and worked fine on AC.\n\nüí• Current State (2025 October)\n\nThe internal laptop display stays black most of the time (backlight faintly glows).\n\nExternal 200 Hz monitor (HDMI) works well ‚Äî I can even play Apex Legends for hours on medium settings with GPU VRAM capped to 4 GB.\n\n\nNVIDIA Control Panel won‚Äôt open, though the RTX 2070 is visible in Device Manager and Task Manager.\n\nBoot behavior:\n\nExternal monitor connected via HDMI.\n\nPress power ‚Üí CMOS error occurs(sometimes it wont be displayed in either of the displays, occurs when I start the laptop after a long time, like half a day etc) (I press enter to proceed with booting, as one can see if windows is booted or not by pressing caps lock to see if the button lights are working or not) \n\nWhat happens next in a successful boot is, the powee button light goes off and turns on in like 2 sec, I press entee agan and the same cycle happens for one more time (2 to 3 timez at max), and then the external display connected (sometimes internal display too) gets hp omen logo boot screen. Post this, if windows login acreen comes, in atleast one of the displays, it is a successful boot. Else, I have to force shutdown the pc and start again\n\nSystem reboots itself once or twice.\n\nHP Omen logo appears ‚Äî almost always on the external monitor.\n\nDisplay outcomes (approx. 10 boots):\n\n5 times ‚Üí only external monitor shows the Windows login screen, laptop panel stays blank.\n\n1 time ‚Üí both monitors work correctly and internal 144 Hz panel shows Windows login.\n\n4 times ‚Üí internal panel = black, external = HP logo only (no Windows output). I can still log in blindly and shut down via Alt + F4, so the system is running headless.\n\nWhen I try to ‚ÄúDuplicate display,‚Äù both displays drop to 1024√ó768 @ 60 Hz, the only modes Windows detects for the laptop screen.\n\nüîé Current Symptoms Summary\n\nGPU and HDMI output work reliably; internal panel almost dead.\n\nCMOS error on every cold boot ‚Üí BIOS resets device detection.\n\nHP Diagnostics previously confirmed Video Memory failure.\n\nüí≠ My Suspicions\n\nPartial GPU VRAM degradation or faulty eDP (output to internal panel).\n\nPossible loose or damaged eDP cable/panel connector.\n\nWeak CMOS battery causing repeated re-detection and boot loops.\n\nBattery-charging fuse blown (confirmed), forcing AC-only operation.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è What Still Works\n\nExternal monitor gaming at 200 Hz for hours.\n\nAll USB, audio, and Ethernet functions.\n\nInternal panel sometimes returns to life for one boot, then fails again.\n\n‚ùìLooking for Advice\n\nHas anyone seen an RTX-series GPU that works fine externally but fails internally?\n\nCould a failing VRAM or eDP transmitter cause intermittent CMOS errors?\n\nIs a GPU reball worth it on this board (L50873-006), or should I hunt for a replacement motherboard?\n\nAny way to disable the internal panel entirely to speed up boot?\n\nAny insights or similar experiences would really help.\nThanks for reading ‚Äî posting this so future Omen owners facing half-dead GPUs can find a full timeline too.",

After I gave it to the repair shop they started taking too long and when I asked for updates they said they needed to import some pieces and that's what was taking too long. Unbeknownst to me during these weeks they went on a minor holiday, despite the fact I told them I had a thesis to write and that in the meantime they could give me back my laptop temporarily. Fed up with the waiting, I demanded that to be returned, only for them to disassemble it the same morning I came back to take it and asking me for one more day. After one day I took it back and now it doesn't start anymore, the BIOS doesn't start, and Windows recovery USB doesn't work either. I looked inside but nothing has been stolen. What could have they done with it?(They asked for my password) How can I at least salvage the situation?",

I want a 4 TB and compared the Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black 850, and Seagate Firecuda 530 (or 530R as well, which is slightly different). However, there are many threads talking about known issues with the Samsung 990 Pro and Seagate Firecuda 530. The 990 Pro issues were allegedly solved nearly 2 years ago, so I'm wondering if that's true and they are safe to buy now. Also, the Seagate problem comes from using a Phison E18 controller and I hear the Seagate was the only one to wait to firmware update a fix until June of this year. I'm not tech savvy, so I plan on just buying and sticking it in the PS5. Can anyone confirm if the Samsung issues from years ago have been resolved? Do you think Seagate's fix has been applied to SSDs not sold and are safe to buy for the extra endurance (significantly higher than competition)? I know these threads are old news and have come up several times, but I can't seem to find information regarding if the 990 Pro issues have truly been fixed. Also the Firecuda fix seems so recent that I doubt they are ready to go and fixed straight off the shelves.\n\nTLDR: Looking to buy internal SSD: Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black 850, or Seagate Firecuda 530. 1.) Have 990 Pro issues from years ago been fixed? 2.) Do you think the Firecuda fix for Phison E18 controllers from June are safe to buy off shelves? 3.) Which internal SSD should I buy for my PS5 with a heatsink?",

I paid 150 euro's for it. Would you consider this a good deal? I purely choose the x over the x3d version simply because they are not on the market anymore here in the netherlands. Will the fps boost be as significant because I did not want to drop abother 800 euro's to upgrade to am5 because whenever I get a new GPU then I will most likely upgrade the whole new rig.  \nwhat are your thoughts?",

I'm no aficionado when it comes to hardware (I don't have alot of opportunity to tinker with parts) but I did my best looking from sources like Daniel Owen and the PSU Cultist Network, and here's what I ended up choosing for the most part. I'd love to get your opinions on this because when I put these into the PCPartPicker website, it told me that the PSU exceeds the recommended length of 140mm for the casing, and that the RAM clearance with CPU Coolers are not checked. I know the parts from the image but I can't really imagine it like how it would all physically fit, if there's some website out there that can visualize this, that might help though..\n\nAnyways, here are the parts and thanks in advance!\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D  \nCPU Fan: Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE 66.17 CFM  \nMoBo: ASRock B850M Pro-A WiFi Micro ATX AM5  \nMemory: G.Skill Flare X5 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL36  \nStorage: Western Digital WD\\_Black SN850X 4 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4  \nGPU: Asus TUF GAMING OC GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB Video Card  \nCase: Asus Prime AP201 MicroATX Mini Tower Case  \nPSU: NZXT C1200 (2024) 1200 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply",

Considering all this im thiking to upgrade.\n\nBTW im from India and there are plenty of cheap options but obviosly they dont have all the features, i want good airflow, clean aesthetic (im planning for a blackout build with glass sides) be as future proof as possible so it should be somewhat modern today.\n\nI saw two Antec cases to be interesting which are the Antec p20c and C7, but to me the c7 looks much better and has more cable management options and got it for $79, so i already ordered that, but now im wondering if it will be enough for air flow, it comes with 4 argb fans, im gonna install and Arctic liquid freezer III Pro 360 aio which add 3 more fans, then ill get 3 more Arctic p12 max fans.\n\nWill this be enough? should I look at other case options?

It's been awhile that Windows doesn't sync, always need to manually sync the time despite the settings set to auto sync are enabled. It's always off everyday, keeps changing back to a few hours",

    "title": "VRM thermal pads melted, driver crashes when launching games(black screen), is my GPU cooked?",
    "selftext": "To preface, I have a 3080 FTW Ultra that I got in early 2021 powered by a SF750 SFX.\n\nSo I had been running FanControl for a while to run a fan profile on my case fans / GPU, but I guess a recent update had knocked out its ability to read sensor data correctly. Last Thursday while playing BF6 for idk an hour or so, one match I went to load into and my screen went blank but discord etc remained working. I tried win+shift+ctrl+b to reset the driver and it did nothing, so I had to hard restart the computer. When it rebooted, there was a windows update (of course) and then I noticed there was an nvidia driver update dated Oct 14 that was available so I downloaded it, and resumed gaming.\n\nThe next day, while playing some BF6 again I could hear my fans running like crazy, opened up fancontrol and saw the notification indicating the sensor reading issue and that it needed an update to allow it to properly read sensor data - fancontrol said my GPU was at like idk 45C but HWinfo had it at 88C, the hotspot was around 100C, I have no clue what it was while running BF6 since I had quit the game immediately when I heard the fans. Updated fan control, redid my fan curves and then launched BF6 again and it was fine. I played Valorant a bit later and was fine. In hindsight I have no clue what temps were when i initially had the first black screen, I‚Äôm unsure if the computer would have just shut off to prevent it from melting entirely or crashing the display driver and stop working would be the way it would handle overheating.\n\nSaturday I had gamed for a lil with zero issues, but then yesterday evening, I launched BF6, sat in the menu and then upon joining a game, black screen. I launched OCCT to try and stress test, black screen again. Mind you the rest of the computer appears to work, just no video output. Restarted, opened MSI afterburner and tried UV a tiny bit (used to have a nice UV for a long while but the profile got deleted on an update maybe sometime in August, didn‚Äôt really worry about redoing it and dialing it in again. Reduced power limit to 90% to see if maybe it was a PSU issue, ran a power test and it was fine, ran the VGA test and it threw an error but I didn‚Äôt get a black screen so I assumed the UV was maybe a tad unstable or something. Launched valorant while my friends were playing, sat in the menu, went to the range and did several rounds and when they were ready I joined their group and the moment it found a match and went to switch screens, black screen again‚Ä¶\n\nSo I took the GPU out, I have no clue what I‚Äôm looking at/for, but I noticed my thermal pads I‚Äôm assuming on my VRMs had melted sometime before last night, I‚Äôd only assume it could have been last Thursday but I‚Äôve had this card for several years (normally under load it would be ~60C or less). \n\nIm assuming thermal pads don‚Äôt melt unless it sustains some bad temps.  Am I cooked, would replacing the thermal pads and putting paste on the GPU even be worth it?  Here is a [photo of the VRMs](https://postimg.cc/HJPsM8hv) and the board. I‚Äôm nervous that repeated issues could be causing power spikes / instability and potentially damage my PSU as well.\n\nAnyone out there who could maybe help?\n",

The retailer website says it supports up to 7000 series and some sites say it needs an bios update. so i'm wondering if the later is true and how hard is it to do a bios update. by logic i'm thinking you just put it on a flashdrive plug it in and flash the bios somehow, but i've heard that you can brick the mbo by doing it if you do it wrong. So do i really need a 9600x if i upgrade to a 5070ti or is the 7600x enough, the price difference is around 30‚Ç¨ so it would be financially wiser to get the 9600x. Oh and i'm on 1080p and if i'm upgrading to a 5070ti that means i've decided to get a 1440p monitor. Thanks for the advice in advance",

If it was needed would I still be able to use the 5070 on a 1080p monitor until I upgraded the monitor to 1440p (which would be in at least 2 months or 3) or am I fine without a 1440p monitor for now?  \n  \nThe games I mostly play are:  \nMinecraft: Modpacks. 300+ mods (would like to use shaders with as much FPS as possible), Overwatch, Valorant (rarely), Baldur's Gate 3, Rocket League, Red Dead Redemption 2, Borderlands 3 (want to get 4), The Last of Us, Halo Infinite, Life is Strange, Cyberpunk 2077, Assassin's Creed Shadows and so on.\n\n  \n**TL/DR**  \nCurrently running a 240 Hz 1080p monitor with an RTX 3060 Ti and Ryzen 5 5600G.

The crashes happen while playing but ive also had in during the intro when launching the game.\n\nWhen I look at the crash reports I see these messages:\n\n\"Message: Gpu Crash for unknown reasons! Callstack here is probably irrelevant. Check if Breadcrumbs or Aftermath logged anything useful.\"\n\n\"The GPU will not respond to more commands, most likely because of an invalid command passed by the calling application. GPU Crash Reason: Unknown\"\n\nThe crashes started happening after I briefly tried playing with a 100Mhz overclock (memory and clockspeed). I didn't touch the voltage. During stress testing my temp's where around 60 degrees and stable. Temps are the same while playing. After undoing the overclock the crashes persist. Everything is stable in both Kombuster and superposistion and when benchmarking other intensive games like total war warhammer II. I tried playing Total war warhammer II without benchmarking and this was also no problem\n\nI have so far tried:  \n\\-Removing MSI afterburner  \n\\-Clean reinstall of my driver to most recent version  \n\\-Clean reinstall of the game(removing all my mods)  \n\\-Lowering Graphic settings  \n\\-Going back to save file before the crashes started happening\n\nDriver crashes and fan stopping point to GPU damage, altough this seems unlikely according to most sourches I've read. I've had the GPU for about 4-5 years. The problem also seems game specefic.\n\nCan ayone help?\n\nspecs:  \nMSI B450 TOMAHAWK MAX (MS-7C02)  \nAMD Radeon RX 5700  \nAMD Ryzen 7 5700X",

No AIO etc. I am looking at a system using a 9600x CPU, 9060 XT GPU. One M2 drive with no other drives.\n\nIs the Lian Li A3 quieter overall?

I plan to put the 140mm as rear exhaust, three 120 mm as front intake, one 120 mm on the PSU shroud and two 120mm as top exhaust (over the CPU).  \nI still have two 120mm fans as well as five potential fan locations : the last top location (not over any components) and the second PSU shroud location (right above the PSU itself), as well as three locations on the side.  \nIs it better to :\n\n1. Put one more over the PSU and one on the final top location?\n2. Put the two on the side of the case as intake?\n3. Order three more fans to fill all the slots and achieve such godlike airflow my computer becomes capable of flight?\n\nMy problem with 1. is that I feel like the third top exhaust is just going to \"steal\" some of the front intake which will be diverted without going over any component and the second shroud is right over the PSU itself so will have poor intake anyways. On the other hand with 2. the side intakes will be orthogonal to the front intakes which I feel probably isn't that great for airflow (weird turbulences)? And also if I do that my intake will starts grossly overtaking my exhaust. Is there such thing as too much positive pressure?\n\n(I'm well aware the real answer is that I don't need so many fans, but I've already ordered them and you only live once, so...)  \nThanks.\n\nEdit : Here's a picture in case my description isn't clear : yellow is where I'm not sure.  \n[https://imgur.com/a/pGaxaAk](https://imgur.com/a/pGaxaAk)",

I have seen a couple but standing out would be the asrock b650 steel legend which is 180e. There is also a b850 for 190e. I find this however a bit too pricey for my budget and also heard about a problem with upgrading to 9000 series on asrock. Are there any good mobo with pci e 5(future proof) that i can find below this price. I found some from gigabyte but there seem to be problems over reddit with some of them. Also, i would want them to be preferably black( asrock steel legend doesnt meet this criteria either :) ). Thank you!",

    "selftext": "Hey redditors!\n\n  \nIf you're looking for someone's experience on bringing their PC to an international flight, mine might be heplful.\n\nI took my PC on a 3 hour flight with me, and was initially very scared. After watching many tutorials, I settled upon taking the GPU out and entirely filling the interior of the PC with clothes. I've seen people fill it with expandable foam, which is a better option but is way more expensive than just my clothes, that I'll be taking with me anyway. I then wrapped the PC in about 3-4 layers of bubble wrap to keep it from moving. As for the box, anything with enough cushioning should work fine. Use the original PC case box if you still have it, but pretty sure your PC will hardly fit in it anymore because of the bubble wrap, but that box was supposed to handle your empty case, not your built pc. My initial plan was a suitcase, but only go with that if its a hard-shell, but still give a lot of cushioning because the airport staff might reject to label it as \"FRAGILE\" and the airport handlers really don't care about our luggage. Finally, I bought a corrugated box that was pretty tough and in it, surrounded the pc from all 6 sides by foam/clothes. I was travelling with family so had no issue as for the amount of clothes, but you can buy normal foam as well, just make sure it wont start dropping pieces of it when moved around (happens with certain types of foam). I then taped the box as well as I could (almost spent an entire roll) and even sat on it to confirm its rigidity. As for the GPU, I took a rigid box I got with my headphones and after bubble wrapping the GPU, I put it in the box, surrounded by foam as well. I could not find static bag so had to use bubble wrap, but if you manage to find a static bag, often in the original packing of the GPU, use that before bubble wrapping. At the airport, the security officers thankfully did not suspect a thing and I passed security. Before getting the boarding pass and checking in the bag, I told them to label the bag as \"FRAGILE\" and they did so in front of me. But I'm not really sure how much that helped since the side the \"FRAGILE\" was written on is almost everytime not the one facing you. I'm pretty sure the handlers ignored it too. When I reached my home and opened the box, I could see everything in the same condition as I had left it, which was a huge relief. Then I opened the side glass, took out all my clothes, installed the GPU (which arrived in perfect condition too) and powered on the PC. \n\nAnd that's how I successfully brought my PC with me on a flight.",

    "selftext": "Tried to post this to r/playstation and it got removed immediately. If you know of another place I should post this instead of here I can post there as well. I've been doing a lot of research on mainly 3 internal SSDs for PS5 since I plan on upgrading my storage. I want a 4 TB and compared the Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black 850, and Seagate Firecuda 530 (or 530R as well, which is slightly different). However, there are many threads talking about known issues with the Samsung 990 Pro and Seagate Firecuda 530. The 990 Pro issues were allegedly solved nearly 2 years ago, so I'm wondering if that's true and they are safe to buy now. Also, the Seagate problem comes from using a Phison E18 controller and I hear the Seagate was the only one to wait to firmware update a fix until June of this year. I'm not tech savvy, so I plan on just buying and sticking it in the PS5. Can anyone confirm if the Samsung issues from years ago have been resolved? Do you think Seagate's fix has been applied to SSDs not sold and are safe to buy for the extra endurance (significantly higher than competition)? I know these threads are old news and have come up several times, but I can't seem to find information regarding if the 990 Pro issues have truly been fixed. Also the Firecuda fix seems so recent that I doubt they are ready to go and fixed straight off the shelves.\n\nTLDR: Looking to buy internal SSD: Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black 850, or Seagate Firecuda 530. 1.) Have 990 Pro issues from years ago been fixed? 2.) Do you think the Firecuda fix for Phison E18 controllers from June are safe to buy off shelves? 3.) Which internal SSD should I buy for my PS5 with a heatsink?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm completely stuck with a problem that started the moment I upgraded my GPU, and I‚Äôm hoping someone here can see what I‚Äôm missing. I upgraded from an RX 580 to a Gigabyte RX 9060 XT, and ever since then my whole system has become stuttery ‚Äî not just in games, but even in Chrome and Windows. None of this happened before the upgrade.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nSymptoms\n\t‚Ä¢\tIn games (Apex, etc.):\n\t‚Ä¢\tCPU sits at 100%\n\t‚Ä¢\tGPU usage only 30‚Äì50%\n\t‚Ä¢\tLow FPS and heavy stutters\n\t‚Ä¢\tApex menu sometimes stuck at ~30 FPS\n\t‚Ä¢\tShaders rebuild more often than they should\n\t‚Ä¢\tEven outside gaming:\n\t‚Ä¢\tChrome tabs can send CPU to 100%\n\t‚Ä¢\tWindows feels ‚Äúmicro-stuttery‚Äù and slower than before\n\t‚Ä¢\tTemps are fine (both around ~60¬∞C)\n\t‚Ä¢\tThis did NOT happen with the RX 580\n\nThis doesn‚Äôt feel like a normal ‚ÄúCPU bottleneck.‚Äù If it were, Windows and Chrome wouldn‚Äôt be choking, and the system wouldn‚Äôt feel worse with a better GPU.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nMy specs\n\t‚Ä¢\tCPU: Ryzen 5 3500X\n\t‚Ä¢\tGPU: Gigabyte RX 9060 XT\n\t‚Ä¢\tMotherboard: ASRock B550M Pro4\n\t‚Ä¢\tRAM: 16GB (2√ó8GB) DDR4 @ 3200MHz\n\t‚Ä¢\tPSU: Seasonic S12III 500W\n\t‚Ä¢\tMonitor: 1440p 165/180Hz\n\n‚∏ª\n\nThings I have already tried\n\t‚Ä¢\tClean driver reinstall with DDU in Safe Mode (internet unplugged + AMD factory reset)\n\t‚Ä¢\tBIOS settings checked:\n\t‚Ä¢\tCSM disabled\n\t‚Ä¢\tAbove 4G decoding enabled\n\t‚Ä¢\tResizable BAR enabled\n\t‚Ä¢\tReinstalled shader cache\n\t‚Ä¢\tVerified game files\n\t‚Ä¢\tRAM XMP enabled (3200MHz confirmed)\n\t‚Ä¢\tNo overclocking\n\t‚Ä¢\tTemps good\n\t‚Ä¢\tFresh AMD software settings (no overlays, no V-Sync issues, no FMF enabled)\n\n‚∏ª\n\nWhy I‚Äôm confused\n\nMy old RX 580 was weaker, but everything was smooth ‚Äî in games and in Windows. After the upgrade, the system feels worse overall, which makes me think something is wrong at a deeper level (driver issue, BIOS quirk, PSU? CPU scheduling?).\n\n‚∏ª\n\nWhat I want to know\n\t‚Ä¢\tCould a PSU or BIOS issue cause this behavior?\n\t‚Ä¢\tIs there something AMD-specific I might‚Äôve overlooked when switching GPUs?\n\t‚Ä¢\tHas anyone seen a GPU upgrade cause system-wide stutter, not just gaming issues?\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny advanced troubleshooting steps I should try next?\n\nI‚Äôm open to trying anything. Any ideas are appreciated, because I‚Äôm out of things to test at this point.\nThanks in advance!",

I pressed on the pads to make them thinner, reapplied thermal paste and made sure to remount the leaf spring in a cross pattern with even torque. Here were the results:\n\nGPU Temp: 86¬∞C / VRAM Temp: 95¬∞C\n\nI reopened the card again. This time I change the thermal paste with some Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut.

Considering all this im thiking to upgrade.\n\nBTW im from India and there are plenty of cheap options but obviosly they dont have all the features, i want good airflow, clean aesthetic (im planning for a blackout build with glass sides) be as future proof as possible so it should be somewhat modern today.\n\nI saw two Antec cases to be interesting which are the Antec p20c and C7, but to me the c7 looks much better and has more cable management options and got it for $79, so i already ordered that, but now im wondering if it will be enough for air flow, it comes with 4 argb fans, im gonna install and Arctic liquid freezer III Pro 360 aio which add 3 more fans, then ill get 3 more Arctic p12 max fans.\n\nWill this be enough? should I look at other case options?

    "selftext": "Hey redditors!\n\n  \nIf you're looking for someone's experience on bringing their PC to an international flight, mine might be heplful.\n\nI took my PC on a 3 hour flight with me, and was initially very scared. After watching many tutorials, I settled upon taking the GPU out and entirely filling the interior of the PC with clothes. I've seen people fill it with expandable foam, which is a better option but is way more expensive than just my clothes, that I'll be taking with me anyway. I then wrapped the PC in about 3-4 layers of bubble wrap to keep it from moving. As for the box, anything with enough cushioning should work fine. Use the original PC case box if you still have it, but pretty sure your PC will hardly fit in it anymore because of the bubble wrap, but that box was supposed to handle your empty case, not your built pc. My initial plan was a suitcase, but only go with that if its a hard-shell, but still give a lot of cushioning because the airport staff might reject to label it as \"FRAGILE\" and the airport handlers really don't care about our luggage. Finally, I bought a corrugated box that was pretty tough and in it, surrounded the pc from all 6 sides by foam/clothes. I was travelling with family so had no issue as for the amount of clothes, but you can buy normal foam as well, just make sure it wont start dropping pieces of it when moved around (happens with certain types of foam). I then taped the box as well as I could (almost spent an entire roll) and even sat on it to confirm its rigidity. As for the GPU, I took a rigid box I got with my headphones and after bubble wrapping the GPU, I put it in the box, surrounded by foam as well. I could not find static bag so had to use bubble wrap, but if you manage to find a static bag, often in the original packing of the GPU, use that before bubble wrapping. At the airport, the security officers thankfully did not suspect a thing and I passed security. Before getting the boarding pass and checking in the bag, I told them to label the bag as \"FRAGILE\" and they did so in front of me. But I'm not really sure how much that helped since the side the \"FRAGILE\" was written on is almost everytime not the one facing you. I'm pretty sure the handlers ignored it too. When I reached my home and opened the box, I could see everything in the same condition as I had left it, which was a huge relief. Then I opened the side glass, took out all my clothes, installed the GPU (which arrived in perfect condition too) and powered on the PC. \n\nAnd that's how I successfully brought my PC with me on a flight.",

I've been doing a lot of research on mainly 3 internal SSDs for PS5 since I plan on upgrading my storage. I want a 4 TB and compared the Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black 850, and Seagate Firecuda 530 (or 530R as well, which is slightly different). However, there are many threads talking about known issues with the Samsung 990 Pro and Seagate Firecuda 530. The 990 Pro issues were allegedly solved nearly 2 years ago, so I'm wondering if that's true and they are safe to buy now. Also, the Seagate problem comes from using a Phison E18 controller and I hear the Seagate was the only one to wait to firmware update a fix until June of this year. I'm not tech savvy, so I plan on just buying and sticking it in the PS5. Can anyone confirm if the Samsung issues from years ago have been resolved? Do you think Seagate's fix has been applied to SSDs not sold and are safe to buy for the extra endurance (significantly higher than competition)? I know these threads are old news and have come up several times, but I can't seem to find information regarding if the 990 Pro issues have truly been fixed. Also the Firecuda fix seems so recent that I doubt they are ready to go and fixed straight off the shelves.\n\nTLDR: Looking to buy internal SSD: Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black 850, or Seagate Firecuda 530. 1.) Have 990 Pro issues from years ago been fixed? 2.) Do you think the Firecuda fix for Phison E18 controllers from June are safe to buy off shelves? 3.)

Will the fps boost be as significant because I did not want to drop abother 800 euro's to upgrade to am5 because whenever I get a new GPU then I will most likely upgrade the whole new rig.  \nwhat are your thoughts?",

It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it‚Äôs amazing that AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "**Greetings, everyone!**\n\nOur upcoming project - a medieval RPG¬†**Legacy of Valor**¬†\\- is on Kickstarter, and we've already surpassed our first stretch goal.\n\nBut first, I'd like to introduce you to the game itself.\n\n**Legacy of Valor**¬†is a medieval RPG that blends¬†**castle building**,¬†**territory management**,¬†**large-scale battles**, and a¬†**story-driven narrative**¬†into one immersive experience. In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Hus√°k! üòä), but soon,¬†**thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his¬†**passion, enthusiasm, and desire**¬†are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Hus√°k himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to¬†**expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile ‚Äì and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point,¬†**we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that¬†**Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind¬†**Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*‚ÄúHey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors ‚Äî If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you‚Äôre gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step ‚Äî launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign ‚Äî just like old times ‚Äî and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let‚Äôs rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let‚Äôs build that castle from the ground up ‚Äî together.‚Äù*\n\nWe can‚Äôt express how much this means to us.¬†**Warhorse Studios inspired us**¬†\\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives¬†**Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let‚Äôs carry this legacy forward.¬†**Together!**\n\nKickstarter:¬†[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord:¬†[https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit:¬†[r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook:¬†[https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX:¬†[https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website:¬†[https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

At the time and to this day, I have not seen a banner on Humble's store indicating they are out of keys for Ryse: Son of Rome. I am using Chrome and not running any ad blocker, so I suspect this is not an issue with my personal browser. These banners are referenced in Humble's FAQ on key exhaustion. I have exchanged 3 messages with humble support inquiring about the lack of a banner and if the 60-day refund window applies if I have not received a key. Not only did they take on average 7 days to respond they also talked around my questions and provided no real support. I am willing to give a great deal of leeway, after all, this is for charity. That said, the dishonesty or ineptitude of the support team and the implication that Humble can keep my money and provide me with nothing in return just leaves me with a gross feeling that I can't shake. I will never use this storefront again. I have only ever heard good things about Humble. Am I just phenomenally unlucky, or is this a common experience no one talks about?",

Somewhere.\n\nThe biggest twist, is that the battles are fewer, but longer, with new enemies spawning, dropping loot, and allowing you to craft DURING combat.\n\nIt's a bit like an OVA anime from a larger universe.\n\nWe launched in April, but the game is on sale now, and we added a real nice update during the Autumn sale, so I thought I'd give it a try and tell you about the game.\n\nDesign-wise, I tried to focus on having fewer, but more tactically worthwhile spells, and enemies that are mechanically interesting.\n\nSince launch we've put out a few free updates, and hope to make more. Of note is the extra difficult secret level in the final world. We're very attentive to feedback, and the last update was about helping players deal with how they experienced randomness.\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, both the good and the bad stuff.",

    "selftext": "Just now I was playing mafia 2. I am 9 hours into the game and I started the game with hard difficulty like I have started to do with all of my games recently. I have come at a level that is simply impossible to cross, not because of any skill issue but simply because this game has a bad 'Hard' difficulty mode.\n\nThere are games where hard difficulty simply means a basic buff to all enemies. They function like normal npc's but their damaged is increased, they spot you unreasonably fast, and even their pistols shoot kilometers (miles) away and it takes a takes a whole mag to kill one enemy. Your gameplay does not change. You still take cover and shoot, you simply stay in cover for longer, and have to shoot the same enemy twice as much, but its the same.\n\nIn this particular mission in mafia, the enemies are just unfair. Rather than enemies coordinating better, they and their guns have simply been buffed. And I am not lying when I say this, I cannot shoot a Thompson at my target after a certain distance because of insane recoil, my enemies, with that same Thompson, are killing me with 2 bullets from twice that distance. Molotov cocktails fall in front of my cover but I still get damage, and the most baffling part is that I get some damage even behind covers.\n\nThis is a bad hard mode, although understandable because the game came out in 2010. In such a mode, you can overcome with skill only to be lead to such an instance where skill can not overcome the bad design. Like how my enemy keeps throwing molotovs every 5 seconds in a small space filled with constantly spawning enemies, I peak and someone shoots me, I play smart and get killed by a Molotov that isint even near me.\n\nI am also playing wolfenstein currently and it has a much better hard mode. Its actually challenging but most of all, its reasonably challenging, you can improve and get better or retry until you finally clear a level. Enemy damage does increase but they don't turn into bullet sponges, enemies coordinate better and have better reflexes rather than being one shot kill. In Wolfenstein you just have to plan better, remember the med kits and the Armour and use them strategically. But mafia 2 doesnt offer me any such option, the gameplay is yet the same regardless of difficulty.",

    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nRaivk here, one of the two people working on ULTRA VERTIGO. We initially made this as a sequel to Liminascent, our previous first-person platformer, and renamed it because here in France \"Liminascent\" isn't easy to pronounce...\n\nWell, we had a ton of fun making the game as a side project (besides our boring main jobs), and we are excited to see people playing the demo. It's our first solo project on Steam, as we already released a game with a publisher, but now we want more freedom, hence the self-publishing. We'd be more than happy to get feedback on the game, see what you like, what you dislike so we can enhance it and hopefully make something great in the long run! We're aiming for a release by the end of the year, as most of the \"complete\" game is ready.\n\nThe demo here is just a part of the complete game, to get the feeling of it and see if it's for you. We will probably keep the demo up permanently, as we believe it's better to be able to try a game before buying it.\n\nThat's it! Hope you'll enjoy it. I'll be available to answer any questions you might have.\n\nHere is the link of the game if you want to play!  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA\\_VERTIGO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA_VERTIGO)",

A bright fantasy with an underlying melancholy is how I‚Äôd describe the thematic heart of AA and we‚Äôve been incredibly happy to see how many people resonated with it.\n\n**It‚Äôs also no lie to say that Astral Ascent was the biggest step forward for us as developers in general, and we‚Äôre still incredibly thankful for the community support we received.**\n\nWe‚Äôve also recently launched our next project, [Fallen Fates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276270/Fallen_Fates/), this time a fantasy RPG (instead of a roguelite) built in collaboration with our community through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernian-workshop/fallen-fates). We‚Äôve learned a lot from our past games ‚Äî Astral Ascent most of all ‚Äî and want to take everything we love about them and carry it over into this new, even more ambitious project‚Ä¶ which, truth be told, probably won‚Äôt be done before 2028 (tentatively speaking) just because of the sheer scope of the project.\n\nIn any case, that‚Äôs the short of it about us.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a long road since we first started making games together, and each one has changed the way we think about what we do. Astral Ascent especially left a mark on us, not just in how we design but in how we see the people playing our work. It reminds us why we do this in the first place, and that‚Äôs to make beautiful games people will take joy in playing.\n\n**We‚Äôre excited to chat with you all and answer any questions whatsoever!**   \n\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you all! :)",

    "selftext": "Windows is very close to being great for gamepads. There are multiple third-party apps (like r/Playnite) that allow for a great gamepad experience in multiple aspects, however, typing is NOT one of them.\n\nA lot of games require typing, which prevents us from having a true couch gaming experience on PC, but there's an easy solution that only Microsoft can provide:\n\n**1 - Allow us to open the new on-screen keyboard (OSK), with gamepad support, that at the moment is reserved for tablets, by clicking or pressing A over text boxes, and through a gamepad button combo.**   \nThis would allow the OSK to be invoked by either simulating a mouse click with the gamepad (for older games), selecting text boxes with A (on modern games that eventually support this feature), or force-opening it with a gamepad combo for games that are particularly iffy with text boxes. This would effectively bypass the need to get out of the sofa and use a keyboard just to name your character in a new RPG, for example. \n\n**2 - Make sure the OSK, on gamepad mode, captures all gamepad inputs for itself, and does not allow these inputs to reach the game in the background.**  \nThis would prevent a big problem with the already existing Steam keyboard: if you're not playing the game with SteamInput enabled (for example, in games that already support Xbox gamepads), all the gamepad buttons being pressed while typing are also reaching the game, causing your character to walk, attack or do whatever actions correspond to the typing shortcuts, including leaving the text box in case of emulators. Capturing all inputs from the gamepad and only sending what is actually being typed (the keyboard keys) would prevent this, and massively increase compatibility with older games.\n\n**Bonus:** give us the fullscreen Windows experience for desktops, and allow it to use custom library managers (like Playnite). This would fix a lot of problems with window focus that can happen when launching games in borderless fullscreen and also make the experience more seamless. \n\nI believe these tweaks would greatly improve the gaming experience on Windows, bringing it much closer to an authentic Xbox experience.",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response ‚Äì there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it‚Äôs amazing that AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response ‚Äì there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it‚Äôs amazing that AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

As you can see i have these weird red lines moving over my screen in periodic waves. Weirdly this always just happens to ONE of the two monitors. Depending on which of them is plugged in to the right. Im using the rtx 3060 ti from Kfa2 and have 3dp and 1 hmdi and ive been testing all of them with different cables but always ONE of them has the lines. Now it gets to the even weirder part: When i open the OS Menu they do not appear on it AND when im playing demanding games f.e. RDR2 they dissapear until i close the game, also sometimes when i start sharing screen on discord they disappear too. In my opinion it has to do with the power from the gpu right? does it not have enough power for two monitors? bcs 1 always runs perfect in all different ports (dp 1-3, hdmi). \nPS: I also did a DDU and thought i fixed it but it reappeared after a few seconds...\nAny help would be greatly appreciated this has been driving me crazzyyy\n",

Of course I powered off the PC before install. Powered on and installed o.g. Rx 580 driver then got the driver failed to load about 1/3rd of the way through the install. Even doing a safe boot and ddu the drivers again when it powers up with the rx580 installed I still get no output from it and the wddm windows driver says its working.

The guy I bought it from said it worked in his build and as far as he knows was never used as a mining card.

    "selftext": "So I have basically a complete PC lying around (minus GPU) and I was thinking about putting everything together. It's one of the Chinese X99 knockoffs and while I have a low end Xeon, I also have a pretty high TDP one that I'd like to use. I know the VRMs are notoriously bomb like on these and I have an idea to remedy this, but I'm not sure if my idea is evil genius or court jester.\n\nThe case will not have enough room for a traditional water cooling system (tank, pump separate, all that jazz) so my thought was to buy a cheap AIO and hack in an extra water loop for the VRM. The VRM cooler would be an aluminum manifold block sitting on top of the VRM with putty or thermal glue, and I would just route the water through there before the CPU or after, whichever would work plumbing wise easier.\n\nI suppose if I go this route finding an AIO with a drain would be ideal, otherwise it would be practically impossible to do this without losing coolant and no real way to top it back off.\n\nSo, tear in, remind me of shit I have neglected to think of. As for why? It's just something to do and I hate having PC parts lying around because they become PCs, it's like having spare AR parts when you like guns, they always breed another.",

    "title": "Has anyone tested Advanced Shader Delivery on the new ASUS ROG Ally handhelds?",
    "selftext": "**In 2021 Valve introduced precompiled shader delivery system on SteamOS**. A lot of Steam Deck users liked this feature. It even give some performance advantage in games on Steam Deck compared to the same games launched on Windows. Unfortunately Valve never decided to release this feature to Windows users but there is a hope.\n\nA month ago MS revealed that Windows 11 2025 H2 support ['Advanced Shader Delivery' ](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/introducing-advanced-shader-delivery/)which is basically a copy of system used by Steam Deck on Steam OS. Currently it is used only on games from MS Store (Game Pass) on ROG Ally Xbox (ROG Ally 2). I googled and tried to find any benchmarks, but there are none. Very few people have access to this device\n\nHow to test it?\n\n1. You need have ROG Ally Xbox\n2. You need own a single game available on both Steam and MS Store (PC Game Pass)\n3. Install the same game from both Steam and Game Pass. But do not launch it yet because we need a cold start\n4. Launch a ROG Ally 2 without any apps in background, especially Steam or Epic must be disabled because they are a 'desktop apps' so they load a lot of unnecessary dependencies. Launch a game from Game Pass and do some benchmarks\n5. Launch a ROG Ally 2 again (restart) but this time only with Steam app launched. All other apps like Epic should be disabled so ROG will load to memory only a Steam app. Launch the same game as before but this time purchased from Steam.\n6. Compare results to check if 'precompiled shaders' makes a difference\n\nI‚Äôd love to run this test myself, but I don‚Äôt have a ROG Ally 2 and older devices don‚Äôt support the Advanced Shader Delivery system - at least for now. So I can‚Äôt test it on my ROG Ally 2023. But maybe someone who owns the new Ally 2 could run the test for me?\n\n**This is the first time PC users on Windows have access to 'precompiled shaders'. It could be an interesting to see if this makes any difference or not**",

Im not asking for recommendations on the best cards on the market for these tasks like the x3d or like the 9750 but what would be the best bang for buck if somehow the ones I listed are lacking, I can't figure out if 8 or 12 cores is better for this.(Motherboard recommendations also appreciated)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI'm pretty sure my laptop's GPU just died, and I'd like a second opinion on the chain of events.\n * Model: Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5\n * OS: NixOS\nHere is the exact timeline:\n * Last Night: I hibernated the laptop.\n * This Morning: I found it \"stuck.\" The screen was black, the keyboard was lit, the fan was running, and the chassis was very hot. It was clearly stuck in a failed state and overheating all night.\n * The Critical Failure: I did a hard reboot. The laptop actually started to boot! I saw the NixOS boot text, but then the screen became corrupted with random horizontal red lines and individual pixels getting \"stuck\" on red.\n * My Troubleshooting (After the Failure): After seeing the red lines, I tried to troubleshoot. I opened the case, disconnected the battery to force an EC reset, and also reseated the SSD just in case.\n * Current State: The troubleshooting didn't help (as the hardware was likely already damaged). Now, when I press the power button:\n   * The keyboard lights up.\n   * The screen stays black.\n   * The laptop immediately overheats‚Äîit gets extremely hot to the touch very fast.\n   * The fan spins at 100% trying to cool it.\n   * I've confirmed with an external monitor via HDMI, and it also stays black.\nMy Diagnosis:\nIt seems the failed NixOS hibernate caused the laptop to overheat for hours, which permanently damaged the GPU. The \"red lines\" I saw on that one final boot were the GPU actively dying. Now, the damaged component has a short circuit, causing the instant heat and preventing the laptop from passing its power-on self-test (POST).\nDoes this sound correct?\nThe laptop is still under warranty, so my next step is a Lenovo service call. I just want to be sure I've understood the problem correctly. Thanks!\nTL;DR: Failed NixOS hibernate caused my laptop to overheat all night. When I rebooted, the screen had red lines and stuck pixels. Now it's 100% dead (black screen, instant overheat, fan at max). This is a dead GPU, right?",

I figured I still have my olde 970, so I plopped it in my new rig with my 4070 TI. For a couple of years, everything worked fine  \n  \nHowever recently, everytime I boot certain games I get instant BSOD's/continuous crashes (CS, PUBG). I've noticed turning off the 970 in device manager seems to fix the issue, but that means I can't use my extra monitors anymore.\n\nBut here is where things get truly weird. If I disable the 970, my 4070 TI will keep running at max util (100%) no problem. If I enable the 970, my 4070 TI will drop severely in util right before the crash. In any case, the 970 remains at 0% util.\n\nWhat the hell is going on here? It seems like the 970 is causing some weird sort of interference with the 4070 TI. I've already checked all settings to death, but I can't figure out what the issue suddenly is. Even if I put a load on the 970 exclusively it seems perfectly fine!\n\nSomeone please help!",

It is using a lot more power than the 4080 to get the same performance though, but hey man, you pay anywhere from $200 to $400 less depending on if you buy your gpu used or not. I havent personally tested anything yet but hoping my GPU will run better than the 5070 ti at least by increasing the power limit, not to 366 watts because that might be a bit too much, more like 330w.\n\nthere is a bios switch to this gpu and considering this OC model has three different bios configurations on TechPowerUp, one \"regular\", one quiet, one OC. not sure about what the regular one is supposed to be considering the gpu has a dual bios switch, not a trio bios switch.\n\nKeep in mind the strix bios I flashed was the OC strix bios of the GPU, I see a GPU that was not the OC version but havent tried flashing it to my GPU. so essentially the OC bios of the OC card.\n\noverall, I thought I would have a ton of problems but the process was so smooth I thought it was way too good to be true.\n\nP.S.\n\nwish me luck not burning my 12vhpwr connector üòä\n\nI do have a two 2x8 connector to 12vhpwr each individually powered (not pigtailed) and 75 watts through pcie slot so total limit would be 375 watts from the power supply and 12vhpwr connector, definitely want to get an atx 3.1 psu for this",

I am now sure about most of the components apart from the motherboard and the cooling system.\n\n\n\nFor the cooling system I choose a Thermalright Assassin spirit 120 evo dark for 23 ‚Ç¨. I'll buy a ryzen 5 9600x with a radeon 9060 xt and I'm not sure if the cooling system is enough. Should i buy something \"stronger\"?.\n\n\n\nFor the motherboard I decided for a Gigabyte B850 eagle wifi6e for 181 ‚Ç¨. My questions are: is it a good motherboard? Should i spend some more for a better one? There are also the ASRock one, that are less pricey where I live, but I'm afraid of that whole frying CPU thing. I know that there were some problems with the 9000 3XD and not the 9000x but i would rather not risk my cpu.\n\n\n\nAdding some more details: I'm italian. My build now cost more or less 1100 ‚Ç¨ and I would like to remain near the 1000.

    "selftext": "Hello! I have a question. I want to build a very cheap gaming pc, and I am torn between 2 second hand GPUs: RX 580 8GB (70$) and RX 5500 XT 4 GB (80$). They're almost the same price. I only play games like Geometry Dash, Osu!, Valorant, and maybe some Hell Let Loose and Death Stranding 1. No new AAA games, or new games in general. Which one would be better in terms of performance? Those are the only GPUs that I could find within my budget in Romania on the second hand market, as Nvidia is extremely overpriced. The cheapest functioning 1060 in my area is a bit more expensive than the 580, so Nvidia is a no-go.\n\nMy overall budget for the pc is 2000 RON (~450$). Current parts list:\n‚Ä¢Ryzen 5 2600 (23$) USED\n‚Ä¢One of the GPUs above (70-80$) USED\n‚Ä¢Asus Prime B450 M-K II (67$) NEW\n‚Ä¢16GB Corsair LPX 3000MHz (35$) USED\n‚Ä¢Samsung M.2 SSD 512GB (27$) USED\n‚Ä¢ID-COOLING SE-214-XT (21$) NEW\n‚Ä¢MSI MAG A550BN (60$) NEW\n‚Ä¢Aerocool CS-107-V2 (44$) NEW\n‚Ä¢24GN650-B (68$) USED\n\nI know the prices are weird (Like CPU being more expensive than RAM) but thats the market here I guess üò≠. These are relatively the cheapest ones I could find from all sources, used or new. What do y'all think I should get?",

(TUF series) I'm thinking of installing Corsair iCUE to change my RGB for RAM, but I've seen many people complaining about the Corsair iCUE software, so I'm a bit worried about installing it in my PC. Is iCUE safe to download, and could I possibly change my GPU RGB as well? Or should I install MSI Mystic Light (because my motherboard is made by MSI), because I heard Mystic Light is a software that can change all RGBs of PC components regardless of different manufacturers. I was thinking of trying out OpenRGB but because it's an open-source software, I'm a bit afraid to download it. (+ unfriendly UI)",

I'll buy a ryzen 5 9600x with a radeon 9060 xt and I'm not sure if the cooling system is enough. Should i buy something \"stronger\"?.\n\n\n\nFor the motherboard I decided for a Gigabyte B850 eagle wifi6e for 181 ‚Ç¨. My questions are: is it a good motherboard? Should i spend some more for a better one? There are also the ASRock one, that are less pricey where I live, but I'm afraid of that whole frying CPU thing. I know that there were some problems with the 9000 3XD and not the 9000x but i would rather not risk my cpu.\n\n\n\nAdding some more details: I'm italian. My build now cost more or less 1100 ‚Ç¨ and I would like to remain near the 1000. I'll use the computer for gaming and studying and I would like to arrive at 1440 p.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for everyone who will respond and good day.",

The Case comes with a filter for the top and and the bottom, however, both are inside the case. I chose to negate the Top Filter and remove it completely due to that being exhausts, and if there is dust that gets past, I have no desire to keep it trapped inside, especially when I can just blow it out.  \nanyways, the bottom filter was going to be an issue, as the fans were the fist part of the loop that was going in.  once the GPU was in, the fans are stuck, Neverminded that my Fill port was going to be stuck between them (see green line of Photo 16). so I chose to take the bottom filter out and attach the Fans directly to the grid of the case. I then used the feet of the case to pinch and hold in place the filter to the bottom of the outside of the case. (see photo 10). so now when it becomes time to clean the Filter, I dont need inside the PC nor, do I need to empty the loop to gain access to do so.  \nI did Cut and shape a Filter for the back (not pictured), rear (photo 11), and top (photo 12, well get back to that later). The Purpose of such was/is 2 fold. For the rear, it acts as a dust filter for the intake fan, and also as a passive air flow restrictor. on the back, it air filters for the PSU, but is primarily used for passive airflow restriction. (additionally, it made the Rear Intake fan quieter than without the Filter, so bonus positive!)  \nIt is a positive pressure system, with 4 intake, 2 exhaust, and everywhere that isnt the radiator has a dust filter for the purpose to redirect all other passive airflow through the radiator where the 240 fans arnt (see photo 15).\n\nOne large issue I ran into with the parts I had chosen was getting the Top radiator and Fans Level. Unfortunately, I dont have any photos of this, so youll just have to take my word for it. my resolution was to Attach the fans to the radiator, and the radiator Directly to the Top pannel, much in the same way I attached the Fans at the bottom of the case. it is important to not that the case was not designed to do such a thing. the Radiator only had the center 4 screw holes align to an open space of the grid on top.  \nadditionally, I had remove the Mounting brackets for the top fans so that the radiator was unobstructed to the top pannel. this came with a bonus positive of another \\~1/2 inch (sorry, I'm American) of vertical height to play with for the Tubing.  \nThe case comes compatible with a 120 or 140 width fans, adjusted by moving one of the support bars to the 140 width opposed to the 120 width it comes with. I actually removed the font fan support bracket and moved the back one to the 140 compatible spot to help retain case rigidity. this was cool because it actually was a wide enough adjustment that it stayed out of the way of the Radiator as well!  \nFinally, I added a Filter to restrict the passive airflow out the top behind the radiator. This one is on the inside of the case, opposed to the outside, because as previously stated, the air inside is already supposed to be filtered in addition to its sole purpose is to encourage the Passive moving air though the radiator. \n\nbending the tubes was much less of a chore than I thought it was gonna be. the chore was getting the exact bends I wanted. I ran out of tube that came in the \"starter pack\" otherwise I would have tried a few more times to get the bends to be compliantly Parallel.  \nI'm glad I wasnt commissioned for the bends, but as the one to enjoy it I am more than happy with how it turned out, especially as first time Bender.  \non one hand, being an MATX case it was cramped to work in, but it really wasnt an issue. and the added benefit of less length of tube to fight. the one at the top back would be a concern, but it was a clone parallel run for the one in front, so I just measured from and copied that one.  \nthat was also my tight bend since It was going to be the hardest to see. (short of the fill port, but that one isnt a tight or complicated bend.)\n\nFilling this was much more of a Butt than I expected it to be. While I did include a fill port, allowing the case to be stood on its end, and the fill port becomes the highest point in the system, I failed to recognize, that in order to fill smoothly, you need enough water weight to push the water in the fill port back up to the next highest point in the loop. I didnt feel like spending another 5 bucks and a week of waiting for another fitting to arrive, so I suffered by filling the fill port, closing it and then rolling the whole pc until the fill port was empty enough to refill, opening the fill port, letting a little bit of air escape, repeat... many, many times.  I got a little sore the next day and there is a dent in my folding table from where I kept putting the corner of the system to take a break...  \nin hind sight, I would get that one more fitting and a manual air pump, or a much larger funnel (which would make a large mess once the loop is filled to remove... but id be prepared for it.  \nI let it run for about an hour on its own with nothing else plugged in and no leaks on the first try!\n\nAdjust the RGB to get rid of the Unicorn Vomit and Voila! build complete! for the photos they are all set to white, however I have the Signal RGB set to screen ambiance for how I actually use it. (again, please forgive lack of photos)\n\nFor initial benchmarking, I looped the Horizon Zero Dawn (my main game I'll be playing) Benchmark many times at 4k no scaling and no framegen, temps were consistent where the CPU sits \\~58 degrees at \\~60% usage, GPU at \\~39 degrees, at 100% usage. and called it night.  \nthe next day, I ran Horizon Forbidden West at 4k no scaling no frame gen and temps are as follows: GPU temp: \\~47c (memory temp 76c) @ 100% usage (\\~85fps)  \nCPU temp: \\~70c usage is still \\~30-33%  (I think CPU temp is so high because it's second in the loop, but I'm not terribly concerned) This was with PBO enabled GPU auto overclock of +105 MHz offset via AMD app's Auto Overclock. CPU is also auto overclocked, not sure it's actually using it though due to low usage.\n\n# The plan for the Future\n\nMight try for some new/better bends when it comes time to clean the loop. (either the liquid or the tubes themselves) also, Id commission an actual piece of glass/mirror to cover the PSU, not just a film (the PSU base wasnt flat, so the Infinity mirror effect is blurred, but still there). otherwise, I am completely happy with this build. I have heard that you can get mirror acrylic, so I'll more likely go for that.  \nAlso, having said that, I am curious to know if I can get an actual Mirror backplace for the GPU block opposed to just the film as well?  \nhoping when it comes time to clean out the loop. there will be a reverse and/or RGB Apex Fan to replace the intake on the rear... there isnt another fan like it, so this was literally the best option I could come up with until that's a thing.  \nAlso also, curious to see what loop I could come up with if I got the right distro instead of left (or vice versa). not sure I'm gonna spend the money to do so, at least not on the first teardown Maintenance.\n\nmy plan for the PC is to run it until the CPU is outdated. I know right now there isnt a consumer tier GPU that actually fully utilizes the CPU, so my plan is to wait until we find that GPU, and then ill get and waterblock that, and then I am gonna run that system with no more upgrades until the system dies or it cant run the games I play.\n\nAdditionally, I'm hoping to Dual Boot the PC over to Steam OS once the Recovery image is updated to the Appropriate Kernel to run on the 9070XT. but thats neither here nor there at this point.",

Really like my setup I‚Äôve only got one cable coming down which is my power cable and cable management is really clean. This also took me a bit as I was trying to figure out the best solution. My solution was using a server rack cable management module that‚Äôs aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you‚Äôd do!",

    "selftext": "**Please ignore the cables and mess, that is currently in progress to be fixed.**  \n  \nI‚Äôm trying to add a 4th display under my main monitor. All three of my current monitors are wall-mounted, so there‚Äôs about an 8.5-inch vertical gap between the desk and the bottom edge of the middle screen. I‚Äôd like to fill that space with a small monitor that can tilt upward toward me, something around 15 inches smaller or larger is fine if it fits nicely.\n\nI work two remote jobs. My main desktop runs my primary job, and my company laptop handles a second, lighter role where I mostly respond to messages and manage a small team. Both setups really benefit from having two screens. I plan to use a KVM switch to share my keyboard/mouse and possibly one or two monitors between the systems, but I‚Äôd like a dedicated screen underneath the middle monitor for quick multitasking.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Fits within an 8.5-inch gap under my center monitor\n* Can tilt upward (20‚Äì35¬∞ ideally)\n* Doesn‚Äôt need to be fancy ‚Äî 1080p is fine\n* Ideally plug-and-play (HDMI or USB-C)\n* Clean look that blends well with my setup\n\nI‚Äôve looked into stretch bar displays, which would look amazing, but most are expensive or complicated to set up. So I‚Äôm leaning toward a portable monitor as a practical option for now. I just want to see if anyone has found a budget-friendly tilted display that fits under a main monitor like this.",

Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything‚Äôs dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

    "title": "Overhauled Lemokey L3",
    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to ‚Äúdynamat‚Äù which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I‚Äôve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that‚Äôs ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn‚Äôt hard with the tool they provide. I‚Äôve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It‚Äôs the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn‚Äôt know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won‚Äôt be my daily driver but it‚Äôs a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI‚Äôll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .¬† everything went smoothly;¬† no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.¬† It‚Äôs probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and ‚Äúhow to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers‚Äù videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).¬† Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote¬† - without needing to look at any references during the build. ¬†\n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced ‚Äî just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;¬† make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;¬† checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn‚Äî->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys). ¬†\n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:¬† prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it‚Äôs too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you‚Äôre probably excited to complete quickly.¬† The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta‚Äô get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**¬† if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n¬†¬† **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;¬† $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;¬† unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.¬† (I‚Äôm liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n¬†",

It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper. \n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I just about had it after about 10 keys with the problem. I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone but I am just about fed up with reliability issues and GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust that 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at odd locaiton. What other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.¬†  \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate ‚Äî $99**¬†  \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile.¬†\n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set ‚Äî please suggest finishes you‚Äôd like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate ‚Äî $99**¬†  \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys ‚Äì ANSI60 4mm plate provides:¬†\n\n* Greater acoustic depth ‚Üí tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response ‚Üí low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability ‚Üí firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n¬†  \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by¬†**GTM Studio**¬†‚Äî a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.¬†  \nWe‚Äôre grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work:¬†\n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:**¬†[Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM)¬†\n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:¬†  \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces ‚Äî crisp and articulate, with excellent stability.¬†\n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).¬†  \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).¬†  \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know ‚Äî community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:**¬†[Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)¬†  \n**Plate Video:**¬†[View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:¬†  \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.¬†  \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate?

    "title": "HMX Firecracker has tickled a weird part of my brain and I may never recover: a review.",
    "selftext": "First and foremost - I'm a tactile switch lover through and through. I've tried a fair number this year, the most recent being the Sillyworks x Gateron Type R. I've tried both more budget options (I see you Akko V3 Cream Blue Pro!) and more premium offerings like the Drop x Invyr Holy Pandas. I've spent too much money but honestly I no longer care because I may have found IT. The one. Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

A few of them are close in tone, but I‚Äôve been staring at them too long to know what actually works anymore.\n\nBefore I commit to a final direction (samples are already ordered), I‚Äôd really appreciate input on:\n\n‚Ä¢ Which of the 6 colourways you guys think works best and would compliment your boards nicely?\n\n‚Ä¢ Any suggestions for alternate colours for either the characters themselves or the gradient?\n\n‚Ä¢ Any that feel like instant no-gos?\n\nI know loud designs aren‚Äôt for everyone, but feedback and input either way is appreciated.\n\nOnce the samples arrive I‚Äôll post real photos - and if they print terribly, I‚Äôll disappear into a hole forever.\n\nCheers",

Not usually a place to go for cheap vintage things as they generally know what's good and price accordingly.  For instance this was right next to a Model M keyboard for $150 which I felt was a little over priced.  Now obviously this will take some work to make it usable.  There are broken rivets so it will need a bolt mod in addition to building a case of some sorts and something to connect to the membrane cables to wire up to a controller.  But the keycaps are very cool and split a spacebar... heck yeah.  For now, it'll sit in the collection as I have a long list of projects to work on.  But someday, this thing will rock again.",

Calvin with Clackify here.\n\nI'm happy to announce I've officially listed Clackify keyboard stands on my store!\n\nA few features:\n\nHolds 5 Keyboards:\nDisplays 4 keyboards on shelves with an additional keyboard slot in the middle for a 5th. I like hiding a fun 60% build in the 5th slot personally :)\n\nKeyboard Protection:\nStands are stable, support 15 lbs per shelf and have been thoroughly strength tested. Cork pads and silicone bumpers are built into each shelf to ensure boards are fully protected and prevent slippage. The bottom of the stand is also equipped with silicone pads to ensure the stand itself doesn't slide around.\n\nUSB Dongle/Flash Drive Storage:\nOffers USB dongle storage for storing and keeping track of wireless dongles as well as flash drives (28 slots total). Note these are not powered or connected, they are purely for storage. No more mixing up or losing your wireless dongles!\n\nPegboard Slots:\nThe back of the stand is equipped with skadis slots for various purposes. The stands are compatible with a variety of skadis accessories and hooks. There are also two slots on each side of the stand for a side hook/accessory. Be on the lookout for skadis accessories to start showing up on the Clackify store as well!\n\n14 Color Options:\nThere are a variety of color options ranging from simple colors to translucent and even Galaxy (sort of metallic) options.\n\nCustomizations:\nIf you'd like to have anything customized, don't hesitate to reach out! Other colors would be possible, and design tweaks could potentially be made for a small fee. Adding logos is also a possibility.\n\nFree US Shipping:\nKeyboard Stands (and any orders over $75 for that matter) ship free to locations in the US.\n\nMore information and photos can be found here: https://clackify.com/products/clackify-keyboard-stand-4-tier\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!

    "selftext": "I have built/modded several premium boards, but regardless of that fact,  I picked up a used Ducky One Mini. I had seen a video by Alex Otos, praising his 60% Ducky budget keyboard. He said it was his go-to for gaming. Therefore I decided to pick one up and guess what? I love it. I can‚Äôt really explain it, but it just feels good to type on. It has a quiet sound profile (which I typically hate), and has a pretty minimalist vibe to it.\n\nWhen I first bought it (used off of eBay), I immediately regretted it because I felt I overpaid for it after I foolishly looked around and found some for half the price. As soon as I got it, I tried to swap out keycaps and those freakin‚Äô inductive switches came out with every single keycap! I soon realized the used budget keycap set I had grabbed (off of eBay, as well) were way too tight. I had to fight every single switch to get it out of the keycap I had pulled off (when I decided I didn‚Äôt like them and chose to go back to the original keycaps). They were so hard to detach from the keycaps, my hands were killing me. I finally resorted to a rubber jar gripper that made the job a little easier as I got down to the last few keycaps.\n\nThe inductive switches came out crazy easy and I was not happy about that. However, when I got it back together again and just chose a few colorful keycaps for some modifier keys, I liked the simple look of it (and I will never again swap out the keycaps!) My hands literally ached the entire next day. \n\nHowever, after using it for a few days, I was hooked!  You have got feel it to understand it.\n\nLayout: 60%\nConnectivity: Tri-mode\nCase: ABS\nMount Style: Gasket-mount\nPlate material: SPCC Steel\nSwitches: Ducky Inductive Switches-linear, 3.5 mm total travel, 40g initial force\nDampening Design: Ducky QUACK Mechanics+ with 7-layer dampening\nKeycaps: Ducky 85% high-purity PBT Double-shot PBT\nStabalizers: Ducky Plate-Mounted\nHot-Swappable: Yes\nReport Rate: 1000 Hz\nSoftware: Web-based \nModifier Keycaps - Double-shot PBT (Ali Express)\n\n",

And I love it! I got all parts and built it nearly two days ago.\n\nI had no experience on mechanical keyboards (unless we count typing some Red Dragon keyboard I found in some store for one second), so I was gambling how the switches should behave. And I really like what I chose... I don't want to say I hit the jackpot yet, still a very new keyboard.\n\nThe keycaps have an uneven height... You can see on the function keys on the middle. But so far, not an actual issue when using my keyboard. And they're like soft on the touch, I really like that. I really liked the look of the MOA profile, and I think they're comfortable in general, especially when playing Tetris - my fingers sit on them seemingly flawlessly.\n\nNot on the sound test video but basically the numpad has a clacky sound in addition. Not (very) loud, especially how I'll almost only use it on Blender, pressing one specific key before I move back to the other keyboard or my mouse.\n\nInserting the keycaps on slot with stabalizers... For the stubborn ones (the enter key being the worst offender) - and I'll admit I don't know if it even actually worked or I was just lucky (I was past at my sleep schedule at that point lmao), I was raising and centering the cross thingies, then have the respective keyboard upside down with my hand (or arm, 1kg keyboard lmao), and insert they keycap in. I had to do all that process more than once with a couple of keycaps, but I did manage to make sure the stabalizers actually do their job.\n\nI have two PCs (a tower, and a tiny Single Board Computer), so the wireless features on both keyboards are reeeeally comfortable for me. I don't mind the keyboard's weight when I have to take out my graphics tablet, my desk is big enough to move around everything I need.",

Its based around an ESP32 CYD display, with a rotary encoder knob). Ideally I don't want to print up a board for this, and would really just like to have flying leads to my IO breakout. \n\nI'm really struggling to get leads to stick to the pins without them oxidising, melting... If it were a few switches I could just about do it, but getting 12 to stick is becoming challenging, and I fear for the longevity of it.\n\nChatGPT seemed to suggest there were keyswitches available with flying leads in place, but I have a strong suspicion its hallucinating given I can't find a single one. Getting a PCB printed is going to be expensive (and I'm already into the too much time / money sunk on random bits stage).\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas or experience in how to reliably connect to the switches? I was hoping I could crimp Dupont style connectors to them, but it seems risky (large moment of force on the thin legs) and theres not much vertical space.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4djk5f1j7avf1.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=d690575f4cfb23c6db93e1b3879d37c69b689d97\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "title": "Overhauled Lemokey L3",
    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to ‚Äúdynamat‚Äù which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I‚Äôve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that‚Äôs ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn‚Äôt hard with the tool they provide. I‚Äôve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It‚Äôs the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn‚Äôt know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won‚Äôt be my daily driver but it‚Äôs a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI‚Äôll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .¬† everything went smoothly;¬† no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.¬† It‚Äôs probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and ‚Äúhow to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers‚Äù videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).¬† Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote¬† - without needing to look at any references during the build. ¬†\n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced ‚Äî just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;¬† make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;¬† checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn‚Äî->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys). ¬†\n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:¬† prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it‚Äôs too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you‚Äôre probably excited to complete quickly.¬† The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta‚Äô get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**¬† if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n¬†¬† **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;¬† $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;¬† unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.¬† (I‚Äôm liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n¬†",

    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to ‚Äúdynamat‚Äù which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I‚Äôve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that‚Äôs ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn‚Äôt hard with the tool they provide. I‚Äôve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It‚Äôs the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn‚Äôt know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won‚Äôt be my daily driver but it‚Äôs a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI‚Äôll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": "Curious what you guys think between having the gold keycaps or the black ones only, which do you think looks better? \n\nI bought this board for $20 because the sockets were coming off due to weak soldering. This is a common problem with a GMMK 3, I was just willing to fix it. Definitely not an advertisement lol. I know Glorious gets a lot of hate, but I still enjoy the board even with the known issues. \n\nI enjoy playing around with these boards because of the ability to customize them. I have many other keyboards with about as much customizability, but they don‚Äôt have a matching numpad for me to play with. I finally decided to get the brass plates and do a black and gold build for my cheap keyboard.\n\nKeyboard(s): Glorious GMMK 3 Pro Barebones (Wired Only) and GMMK Numpad \n\nI have 3 plates for these, for this set up it has the Brass Plate. I also swapped out the knobs, the badge on the keyboard and the badge on the numpad for gold options. Loving the brass plate in this build.\n\nSwitches: Neo X Keygeek Oat\n\nKeycaps: GMK Black & Gold ",

Also I am concerned about Pixel density and if I am really getting the best image quality.\n\nThe second option is the Dell UltraSharp 27‚Ä≥ QHD 120 Hz. This would have less refresh rate compared to the Samsung one, but I'm wondering if it would give a better picture as the pixel density is higher. This would be ¬£390/$520. Making it free.\n\nThe third option is the more expensive Sony INZONE M10S (27‚Ä≥) OLED 1440p 480Hz monitor, which would be a significant upgrade but prices in around $1717.97 / ¬£1270, but essentially has a price of ¬£770/$1030.\n\nI am torn between either keeping my Samsung, or going for the Dell or Sony one. If I do go for the Sony one I'd be paying ¬£770/$1030 out of of pocket, but would end up with a better/ future proofed monitor. At that price point would it be obvious to get it?\n\nUsually I sit around an arms length away, I do a mix of gaming/productivity work.\n\nAny advice would be good.",

I never had VRR on and am not really sure what it does. I thought the colors looked good and do not care for viewing angles. I primarily game (some competitive, some single player) and do some productivity on the monitor.\n\nAfter doing some research, I do not want to have to worry about OLED burn-in and maintenance and want the monitor to last as long as possible. I came upon mini-LED backlighting and am wanting to know if I should get an IPS or VA panel if I do go with mini-LED.\n\nEven then, is it really worth it to go to mini-LED rather than a normal LCD IPS or VA panel? \n\nI understand that each panel has their own strengths and weaknesses but am confused on things like VRR flickering, ghosting, blooming, etc.\n\nIf anyone could help clear my confusion or provide recommendations it would be greatly appreciated!",

It's been 7 hours and already 7 pizel cleaning cycles, is that normal? I think it runs it everytime my PC goes to sleep. I set it to 8 hours reminder but still does it frequently. The second question is, Is 5 min the least amount of time for the sensor to kick in? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I recently bought a miniled hdr1400 4k monitor and I'm trying HDR gaming for the first time. What I find strange is that when I enable HDR in games (god of war Ragnarok, ratched and clank rift apart, the last of us part 1 and so on) colors get really saturated. They get saturated as if I was playing in SDR on the wide gamut monitor without clamping it to sRGB. It only happens in games, because Netflix, YouTube HDR have the right colors and even the desktop in HDR is fine, apart the higher brightness. Is it normal that games have so much more saturated colors or is windows doing something bad?\n\nBefore you ask me, monitor set in 4k full RGB 10 bits, windows HDR calibration tool used, windows ACM enabled to clamp in SDR.\n\n[HDR in png](https://preview.redd.it/6jgh6nhwu9wf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f90464586229a105181c4918b3c072f5f766c42)\n\n[SDR in png](https://preview.redd.it/zn9e7s2zu9wf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4deb72df4bb45becbc49cf59303be037365e1cc)\n\n  \n",

Previously I could use the T450 pretty much all day without any discomfort, but now after using the T470 for just a few hours my eyes hurt like crazy along with a massive headache. This is regardless of screen brightness. I've also disabled anything in Intel graphics control panel like noise reduction, color enhancement, etc. that might be messing with things. I've used plenty of other 1080p or 4k devices for prolonged periods so I don't believe the resolution is related.\n\nI've compared the panels on panelook (https://www.panelook.com/modelcompare.php?ids=17574,30063) and I see they have different PWM frequencies and duty cycles, but I don't know enough about monitors/panels to know for sure if this could be the culprit or if something else is more likely. \n\nThe T470 / N140HCA-EAB has a duty cycle of 1\\~100%, and a PWM frequency of 100(min) \\~ 500(Max) Hz, while the T450 / N140bge-ea3 has a duty cycle 5\\~100% and PWM frequency of 190 (min) \\~ 2K(Max) Hz. There are also some other differences like slightly higher nits and contrast ratio.\n\nI'd like to replace the panel with something that's 1080p still but doesn't hurt my eyes so much. In the meantime I've been using F.lux aggressively and that seems to help some, although I never needed it on the old laptop. I would greatly appreciate any insight or experiences you might have.",

    "title": "OLED or MINI LED IPS?",
    "selftext": "Hi, I am currently deciding on a new monitor. I currently have a 27inch, 1440p, 95hz 350nit brightness IPS. My hardware driving it is an an XBOX series X, occasional mid laptop and a PC with a 7800x3d and a rx 7900 xtx. I am also based in the UK.\n\nI am looking for a new monitor (with the existing becoming a secondary portrait), that is 32 inch (so I can sit further back and push it deeper on my desk and ultimately for a more cinematic experience). I am gonna go for a 4k panel for an increase in pixel density (especially in the case of OLEDs odd text clarity).\n\nRefresh rate I am a bit blas√© about, anything 120hz and above is fine, obviously higher is better.\n\nFor IO HDMI 2.1 is required and ideally id like DP2.1 UBHR 13.5 and higher (Unless someone can make a really good case for something out that is otherwise good), assuming the refresh rate goes much over 120hz. Also USB C with alt mode and atleast 65w charging (not that pitiful shite like 15w).\n\nBudget max of like ¬£1000 but less is ideal. Usage case is like 70% gaming/content 30% working changing at some sections of the to 95% gaming and content and 5% work.\n\nThe choice in my mind really comes down to QD OLED or IPS Mini LED, OLED has superior uniformity, contrast, viewing angles and motion handing; where as Mini LED has brightness.\n\nMy sticking point is that my existing IPS is quite bright and getting a dimmer OLED my look disappointing as well as not particularly bright HDR performance. But Mini LED IPS has blooming, poorer motion handing, uniformity, possible light bleed (big turn off but should be negated by local dimming although it could be an issue). Also aesthetically OLED's look nicer. My environment also changes some what, sometimes I am using my set up in the middle if the day, so bright room, especially come summer, not too good for glossy QD OLEDs, but at the same time I play in the dark for a while where QD OLED is in its element, and then some times with a lamp on which I am unsure as to how QD will look then, either way I could encounter reflections or black raise.\n\nFor some context I am looking at the gigabyte aorus 31.5\" fo32u2p and the benq mobiuz ex321ux. The OLED is cheaper, another of my criticisms with the Mini LED is its high pricing for what it is. I am aware of the Samsung neo G8 but with it being a VA panel with piss poor viewing angles I am not particularly interested.\n\nI have also looked at WOLED's but they have worse text clarity in comparison to both IPS and QD OLED and most seem to be DP 1.4 and matt (I prefer the idea of glossy for the clarity).\n\nI am aware of newer brighter panels for OLED but they seem to be constrained to 27 inch panels, I am sure theyt will come out but they will probably be 8 months off and I can't really be bother; if OLED was SDR 300nits and HDR true black 500, the choice would be vastly easier.

First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ‚Üî 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2√ó HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters.

[P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe‚Äôre currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI am in a unique position where I can get a monitor through my company for a considerably reduced price, as they are funding ¬£500 / $670 towards it. The question is, which monitor should I go for here, or should I keep my own?\n\nThe first option that I currently own is a Samsung Odyssey 1440p 144Hz 32‚Ä≥ QHD, while its nice, its a bit big for my desk and does look a little silly. Also I am concerned about Pixel density and if I am really getting the best image quality.\n\nThe second option is the Dell UltraSharp 27‚Ä≥ QHD 120 Hz. This would have less refresh rate compared to the Samsung one, but I'm wondering if it would give a better picture as the pixel density is higher. This would be ¬£390/$520. Making it free.\n\nThe third option is the more expensive Sony INZONE M10S (27‚Ä≥) OLED 1440p 480Hz monitor, which would be a significant upgrade but prices in around $1717.97 / ¬£1270, but essentially has a price of ¬£770/$1030.\n\nI am torn between either keeping my Samsung, or going for the Dell or Sony one. If I do go for the Sony one I'd be paying ¬£770/$1030 out of of pocket, but would end up with a better/ future proofed monitor. At that price point would it be obvious to get it?\n\nUsually I sit around an arms length away, I do a mix of gaming/productivity work.\n\nAny advice would be good.",

Bass has good texture and weight, and orchestral recordings come across with clear layering and a natural sense of space. Truly excellent. \n\nI have noticed some treble sharpness and sibilance on bright recordings such as choral pieces and flute passages (the high note in Miserere, flutes of Debussy Prelude a l‚Äôapr√®s midi d‚Äôun Faune). Even at moderate volume this was uncomfortable.\n\nIn general, the headphones are clearly at least one tier above the CB Sundaras. Better in every way. I would absolutely keep them if it was not for my ears being punished with high piano notes \n\nHas anyone else run into this with the D7200? it? I want to keep them but the sibilance is an issue for me. So any mitigations would be welcome. ",

    "selftext": "I'm potentially in the market for my first pair of earbuds and I had a few questions I was hoping y'all could help with. I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn‚Äôt stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it‚Äôs no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they‚Äôd be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they‚Äôre better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they‚Äôre still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I‚Äôm really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an ‚Äúactive analog mode‚Äù which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.

    "selftext": "This is my project headphone for my high school design course.\n\nIt needed to fit the following criteria:\n\n* comfortable for long hours with ultralight weight construction\n* sound quality on par with other reference/studio headphones\n* priced relatively affordable compared to the market\n\n**specs:**\n\n* Driver: Peerless 50 mm driver\n* mass: 170g (without cable)\n* materials:\n   * earcups: PLA-LW and PLA\n   * headband strap: Faux leather\n   * earpad: aliexpress 110mm hybrid velour\n   * everything else: PETG\n* Connection: dual 3.5mm\n\n**Comfort**\n\nBeing 170 grams already makes this a comfortable headphone; it feels weightless on the head. Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisn√¶s Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "title": "Susvara and Tubey Goodness",
    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told ¬£1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

Literally stood there with my mouth hanging open.\n\nThere were hundreds of headphones on display that day, but none of them came close to what the Grado delivered. The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are‚Äî 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it‚Äîdo yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

They do seem to make them a bit less toasty (which was not a problem, but was noticeable with the stock pads for me). They also change the frequency response a bit, tilt it a bit to the high end, and open it up slightly. Not an improvement, for me, I like the warm, slightly more intimate feel of the stock pads a bit better, but not something that would stop me from using these either. Sound is still great. Edit: I had said that the sound isolation was not as good, but I am going back and forth now, and really, it is about the same. Also, going back and forth between the two, the sound difference really is minimal - it is there, but less then my initial impression. I don't hear much of a difference in bass either. I think the sound changes a little as the pads warm up, maybe the seal becomes a little better, and the differences, which are not much to begin with, decrease.\n\n Wondering what peoples impressions are, if anyone is still using these on their Maxwell? I am contemplating whether to keep them or not.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say ‚Äî these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural ‚Äî vocals, instruments, bass ‚Äî nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven‚Äôt noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it‚Äôs natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head ‚Äî soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn‚Äôt use them for workouts (they‚Äôre not built for that kind of movement), but they‚Äôre fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal ‚Äî so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you‚Äôre in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you‚Äôve already paired ‚Äî that‚Äôs super convenient. Battery life is great too ‚Äî around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere‚Äôs also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I‚Äôve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I‚Äôve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They‚Äôre not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they‚Äôre absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! üëã\n\nJust grabbed a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 4s! I'm definitely not an audiophile, but I seriously value good sound quality. I'll primarily be using them with my iPhone 12 Pro.\n\nI've been reading a lot about how using a Bluetooth dongle, like the Sennheiser BTD 600, is essential to get the absolute best sound quality out of these with an iPhone. The catch is that these dongles are USB-C and my iPhone is Lightning.\n\nI found this USB-C to Lightning adapter and was wondering a couple of things:\n * Has anyone here tried this kind of adapter setup with the BTD 600 and a Lightning iPhone? Does it actually work?\n * For those who have used the dongle with an iPhone/iOS device, does it really make a significant difference to the sound quality compared to the standard Bluetooth connection (which uses AAC)?\n\nAny advice would be awesome! Thanks in advance! üéß\n",

    "selftext": "So the last few weeks I‚Äôve been hunting for my first pair of real headphones. I‚Äôve been using Astro A50s for a while they‚Äôre great for gaming, but man, they get super uncomfortable after like an hour.\n\nI‚Äôm totally new to the audiophile world, and holy hell, there are so many options. I had no clue where to start, so of course I did what any sane person would do I went to Reddit. I got a few a different suggestions but as I was searching through all of them I ended up looking up the Meze 109 pros and immediately fell in love with the looks. The wood finish on the cups matches my setup perfectly.\n\nSo I take the plunge ‚Äî $800 on the 109 Pros and another $200 on a Topping DX3 Pro+. Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and‚Ä¶ they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn‚Äôt notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I‚Äôd just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I‚Äôd give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two ‚Äî same story. Day three, same thing at first‚Ä¶ until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I‚Äôd never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I‚Äôm just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I‚Äôm not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

    "selftext": "First off, I am new to the headphone space so please excuse my lack of understanding.\n\nI have noticed that most reviewers, whether that's a review on YouTube, or an article on their website, place heavy emphasis on the frequency response curve. They will place this above all else when it comes to sound quality.\nFrom what I understand, frequency response curve is more indicative of a headphones 'sound signature' or what the manufacturer intended it to sound like but is not the only or imo main factor in the overall sound quality. \nFor example, when you compare a cheap pair of headphones to a more expensive one, no matter how well the cheap pair is tuned, it will still lack detail or resolution that the more expensive headphone will have (based on my experience). You might not hear the small variations in the artists vocals or the instruments. It can also lack clarity in the sound. \nSo, I feel, the frequency response curve is only one aspect of the overall sound quality, but there are many more things to consider and compare. You would expect an expensive pair of headphones to still sound 'better' even if it's not tuned closer to the Harman curve compared to a cheaper pair, just because of the better drivers, better materials and superior sound processing. \n\nIf so, why do reviews not talk about the rest of the factors affecting sound quality and focus almost purely on the sound signature, which to some extent can be fixed with an EQ, when the rest of it is not adjustable? \nSometimes they make it seem as if a well tuned $50 pair is better than a $400 pair which is better better build with better materials, with it's only shortcoming being a slightly worse tuning. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Or am I approaching this wrong?\nIs sound signature the defining factor in sound quality and listening experience or should we focus equally on things like clarity, resolution, ability to recreate the small variations in the sound, distortion?\nDo they avoid it because these other factors can't be quantified easily?

    "selftext": "I've tried pretty much every \"spatial audio\" VST and DSP out there, and 99% of it is garbage. Just weird tricks that sound fake. Recently I learned about convolution. I found the ASH-IR-Dataset and just started messing with room impulse files. Then I tried one called Calypso, and that was the first time it actually felt like I was sitting in a room, not listening to a weird effect. The next game-changer was headphone correction. You have to EQ your headphones to a diffuse-field target first. It makes the headphones neutral for the simulation to work on.\n\nThat's when I found the ASH-Toolset. It took me literal days of tweaking to get a sound that wasn't just \"good\" but correct. You have to learn the settings because the defaults probably won't work for you. The most critical part is the HRTF dataset (the \"dummy head\" recordings). You have to test them all (KEMAR, KU 100, etc.) Your ears are physically unique. The HRTF that's perfect for me will sound weird and wrong to you. If you don't find the one that anatomically clicks with your brain, you will never get that true \"in front of you\" sound.\n\nFor the first time in my life, music is actually in front of me, originating from a point in space outside my head. I'm now listening to music I've ignored for years (acoustic, live concerts, old rock) and it's more engaging than the metal I've lived on for 5 years, because I can hear the actual space in the recording. The effect is insane on my IEMs, super precise and immersive. On my HD 650s, it's also incredible, but the sense of space is wider and less \"in your face,\" a totally different but equally cool vibe. If you're tired of the gimmicks and want to hear what's really possible, this is the way.\n\n(I don't know English well, so I apologize if something is written incorrectly.)\n\nupd: I wrote a short instruction on how to start using the dataset - [https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/)",

I decided to google what could be the cause, something led me to believe that the coil wire(?), the ultra thin varnished tiny wire was broken, so I opened it and sure enough it was. Replacement drivers are $192, I bought mine in 2022 for $550. New ones now cost $300\\~$350 depending on sales and such. So I was thinking is it even worth repairing at this point or just upgrade to better headphones. My choice that I landed on (kinda heavily at this stage) are the Meze 109 Pros. I am waiting for a sale for them as I've seen them as low as $628 or so, instead of the $750 they are right now (with coupon or something). I've seen a lot of reviews of these and lot's of people say these could be considered \"end game?\" for a lot of people. I am by no means an audiophile so fair enough in this case.

    "selftext": "I have been using Status Audio since they were created and a massive fan of the brand. I still love and use my Between Pro. I've given the 3 ANC as holiday gifts to every member of my family. So I immediately hopped on the ProX pre-order. And I'm disappointed either I got a defective pair or something is not right. I'm on a Samsung z fold 7 for reference. First issue touching the equalizer in the app immediately cranks the volume to about 300 times louder than max volume, I did blow my ears out at first. Second they don't really actually sound any better than the Between Pro to me. And this is using my personal WAV library. They sound amazing don't get me wrong, but the $79 between pros sound the same. 3rd my MICs are dead, I mean completely dead I've tried using the mics on my PC, MacBook, Chromebook my Samsung even my wife's iPhone and nothing completely dead.\n\n  \nAgain absolutely love status will never give up my Between Pros, but honestly for $279 after tax with pre-order discount, at this price point Status is in competition with the big boys now, and while they do indeed sound vastly superior everything else they're offering at this price point is a massive let down. \n\nAnd this makes me sad.",

I like character ‚Äî not neutrality.\n\nMy first shortlist was Fostex TH900 Mk2 and Sony MRZ-1, but none were available.  \nI ended up getting the FatFreq Deuce ‚Äî the IEMs with the most powerful sub-bass I‚Äôve ever heard.\n\nThen the Virtuoso was announced, and after auditioning them twice, I finally added them to my collection.\n\n**Cons for first:**\n\nFor around $1000, you get a fancy case and Alcantara on the headband and pads. That‚Äôs it. The rest of the materials and build quality feel cheap as shit. Fit isn‚Äôt particularly comfortable either. The screw-in cable connectors make me question the design logic.  \nMaybe I‚Äôm just spoiled by Meze, but overall it feels far from premium.\n\n**Sound**\n\nTested on iBasso Nunchaku, Chord Mojo 2, Astell&Kern ACRO CA1000T, and Cayin HA-2A.  \nI don‚Äôt feel any difference between the gear, so don‚Äôt overpay for it.\n\nOverall, the sound is moderately detailed with good instrument separation ‚Äî  \nan aggressive V-shape with some interesting midrange nuance.  \nThe louder it gets, the richer and denser it becomes.\n\n**Bass**:  \nStrong and plentiful, but not aggressive. Moderately textured, adds weight and body.  \nElectronic and hip-hop tracks sound fantastic.\n\n**Treble**:  \nThere‚Äôs a lot of it.

A&K seems to have borrowed Ultrasone‚Äôs S-Logic spatial trickery,  \nso vocals float ‚Äúin the air‚Äù. When the music carries ambient layers or atmospheric elements, it‚Äôs genuinely captivating.\n\nOverall, the sound is unusual yet very pleasant ‚Äî cohesive, engaging, and fun to listen to.\n\nPosting this because there are almost no reviews or proper FR measurements online.  \nIf you‚Äôre looking for something unique and a bit different, maybe this will help.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I need some advice from the Audeze experts here. I'm about to buy a used LCD-X and I'm confused about which version it is.\n\n**The Facts:**\n\n* Serial Number: **7526658**\n* Purchased new: **March 10, 2021** from xxxx (authorized Swiss dealer)\n* Original invoice included\n* Current asking price: **\\~‚Ç¨850)** \\- seems like a good deal\n\n**The Confusion:** According to what I found online, LCD-X units with serial numbers **7527600 or higher** should be the 2021 revision. This one is 7526658, so technically *below* that threshold.\n\n**BUT** \\- and this is where it gets interesting - **the headphone has ALL the 2021 visual characteristics:**\n\n* ‚úÖ Modern suspension headband (not the old rigid design)\n* ‚úÖ Metal mesh grills (not fabric)\n* ‚úÖ New shiny leather earpads (not the old memory foam style)\n* ‚úÖ Overall 2021 aesthetic\n\nThe seller confirms **everything is original** \\- nothing has been replaced or upgraded. He bought it exactly like this in March 2021.\n\n**My Theory:** Could this be an early 2021 production unit or a transition model for the European market? Maybe Audeze started the 2021 revision slightly before the \"official\" serial number threshold, especially for international markets?\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Has anyone seen LCD-X units with 2021 components but serial numbers below 7527600?\n2. Do you think this is actually a 2021 model that just happened to get an earlier serial number?\n3. At 850 EUROS with all 2021 components visible, is this a no-brainer purchase even if there's uncertainty?\n\nI've contacted Audeze support but thought I'd ask the community too. Any insights would be really appreciated!\n\n**TL;DR:** LCD-X serial 7526658 (below 2021 threshold) but has all 2021 physical features. Bought new March 2021. Is it a 2021 model? Worth buying at ‚Ç¨850?",

    "title": "Trying to further my understanding of headphone power needs",
    "selftext": "I made a post in HeadohonesAdvice recently asking about the plausibility of running a pair of Sennheiser HD 600 off a dongle dac. At least half of the purpose of me asking is to learn more about the technical side of this audio technology, because I love learning and I have a strong desire to understand how things work. Having a strong base of knowledge can make me a more informed consumer if nothing else. \n\nThe responses ranged from ‚Äúno dongle will really provide enough power to run those headphones properly, even if it sounds loud enough‚Äù to ‚Äúamps are snake oil, don‚Äôt waste your money, just use an Apple dongle or, if you really want to blast it, get a fiio ka11 or something.‚Äù\n\nI found it truly interesting that both sides of this argument vehemently insist they are correct, which leads me to believe the science that goes into answering a question like this must be very nuanced and not at all black and white. \n\nStarting with the ‚Äúwhy volume doesn‚Äôt always mean enough power‚Äù argument, the best explanation I could find is that dynamic drivers don‚Äôt have consistent voltage needs across the entire audio spectrum. More specifically, the bass and upper treble have more power needs, and that power form what I‚Äôve gathered is voltage for volume and current for driver control. I may be oversimplifying or possibly just wrong so forgive me, but the broader point is that even if the sound in general sounds loud enough and is therefore getting enough power, parts of the frequency response might not be getting what they need especially when it comes to music with a lot of dynamic range or large peaks in volume. The idea here is that ‚Äúit sounds loud enough to me‚Äù could be an incomplete picture. \n\nOn the other side of the argument I‚Äôm seeing that the above argument is a hypothetical and over complicated concern, that for a high-impedance set like the HD 600 if you can get it loud enough for normal listening then you are supplying it with all the power it needs since voltage equals volume and voltage is the main concern with a headphone like this (as opposed to a set that has low impedance but high current needs). Even Crinacle, a popular figure in the audiophile space, claims that something like the ka11 can provide ‚Äúway too much power‚Äù and could easily run a set of HD 800s at ‚Äúear-splitting volume‚Äù.  Not that his word is gold, or anything, but he still strikes me as someone with a lot of experience and knowledge. \n\nMeanwhile back on the other side again, you can look up power calculators for headphones that more or less verify most dongles won‚Äôt be able to supply the necessary voltage or current for high impedance headphones to run at max potential/without clipping part of the frequency response. \n\nApologies for the wall of text here, I just wanted to provide context for the rabbit hole I‚Äôm going down. I should make it clear I‚Äôm not ‚Äúworried‚Äù about this, I‚Äôm perfectly happy to enjoy my headphones and my music without wringing my hands worrying if I‚Äôm doing it properly. This is purely because I want to learn. I like learning. It‚Äôs that simple. And in service of that, I‚Äôd be interested to hear more detailed information on either side of this argument. Correct me where I‚Äôm wrong, elaborate where I‚Äôm oversimplifying, provide additional context I might not be considering. The folks here seem passionate and knowledgeable and I would be grateful if any of you would be willing to share your wisdom with me in the name of learning new things!",

    "selftext": "This is my project headphone for my high school design course.\n\nIt needed to fit the following criteria:\n\n* comfortable for long hours with ultralight weight construction\n* sound quality on par with other reference/studio headphones\n* priced relatively affordable compared to the market\n\n**specs:**\n\n* Driver: Peerless 50 mm driver\n* mass: 170g (without cable)\n* materials:\n   * earcups: PLA-LW and PLA\n   * headband strap: Faux leather\n   * earpad: aliexpress 110mm hybrid velour\n   * everything else: PETG\n* Connection: dual 3.5mm\n\n**Comfort**\n\nBeing 170 grams already makes this a comfortable headphone; it feels weightless on the head. Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told ¬£1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

    "selftext": "So, I‚Äôve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn‚Äôt stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it‚Äôs no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they‚Äôd be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they‚Äôre better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they‚Äôre still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I‚Äôm really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an ‚Äúactive analog mode‚Äù which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you‚Äôre looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC‚Ä¶ look no further!",

    "title": "Had an opportunity to try the LCD-X, & my comparisons to the Edition XS.",
    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisn√¶s Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

But would a somewhat lower 150 Ohm set like this still get a lot out of the WA3?

    "selftext": "\nI still remember it like it was yesterday‚Äîwalking into that audiophile shop in Paris and discovering the Grado 225e for the first time.\n\nI was blown away. Literally stood there with my mouth hanging open.\n\nThere were hundreds of headphones on display that day, but none of them came close to what the Grado delivered. The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are‚Äî 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it‚Äîdo yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say ‚Äî these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural ‚Äî vocals, instruments, bass ‚Äî nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven‚Äôt noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it‚Äôs natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head ‚Äî soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn‚Äôt use them for workouts (they‚Äôre not built for that kind of movement), but they‚Äôre fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal ‚Äî so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you‚Äôre in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you‚Äôve already paired ‚Äî that‚Äôs super convenient. Battery life is great too ‚Äî around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere‚Äôs also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I‚Äôve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I‚Äôve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They‚Äôre not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they‚Äôre absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and‚Ä¶ they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn‚Äôt notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I‚Äôd just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I‚Äôd give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two ‚Äî same story. Day three, same thing at first‚Ä¶ until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I‚Äôd never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I‚Äôm just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I‚Äôm not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

    "selftext": "I bought a VE Odo (25mw at 32ohms) a while back together with the Samson Sr950 (32ohms), the problem is my phone isn't able to power the Odo correctly probably due to some crappy Xiaomi limit (my phone is the Redmi Note 11, a 200 dollar phone from 2022). The Odo sounds weak compared when I use it on an Iphone 15. I was thinking a bluetooth receiver would be better since it powers itself with a battery and dongles aren't that comfortable to use too. The Fiio Btr11 is my first option as 20 dollars and 30mw at 32ohms. Would it make the Samsons sound good?",

Well, they all sound horrible to me which plays into the logic I had about EQ prior to any of this.\n\nHow am I going to sound like a high end piece on a low end gear?\n\nTake the 990, say I wanted to try the HD800s profile, I autoEQ and apply it to the 990, wouldn't it sound like ass? Surely, the tech on a $1500 headphones is what makes the tuning shine right? If I can just transfer it to a $150 gear, why bother with expensive gear? This is the thing I don't get and the reason why I think all the pricier IEM tuning sounds like ass on the Bunny. I'm obviously wrong so help me understand.

    "selftext": "This is my project headphone for my high school design course.\n\nIt needed to fit the following criteria:\n\n* comfortable for long hours with ultralight weight construction\n* sound quality on par with other reference/studio headphones\n* priced relatively affordable compared to the market\n\n**specs:**\n\n* Driver: Peerless 50 mm driver\n* mass: 170g (without cable)\n* materials:\n   * earcups: PLA-LW and PLA\n   * headband strap: Faux leather\n   * earpad: aliexpress 110mm hybrid velour\n   * everything else: PETG\n* Connection: dual 3.5mm\n\n**Comfort**\n\nBeing 170 grams already makes this a comfortable headphone; it feels weightless on the head. Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told ¬£1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

I can't select anything higher than 720p.\n\nAnother thing that I don't understand is, with both games at the highest resolution I can select (720p), I can activate FSR in silksong (3) but can't in overwatch (4). I thought that to activate FSR I should run the game at lower resolution than the screen,  correct? So in this case, with both games running at 720p and the screen resolution being 1080p, why can't I activate FSR in overwatch but can in silksong?\n\nThanks for your help and sorry if this has been talked to death...

    "title": "Both Trackpads Stopped Working - Looking for Help",
    "selftext": "Hey guys. This post is my last resort in fixing my trackpad issues on my own.\n\nAbout four months ago, the right trackpad on my deck stopped working. A few weeks later, the left one stopped working too. As in no motion or pressure detected in the Test Controller tool.\n\nHere's what I've done so far to fix the issue (not all in one go):\n\n1. Restarted in Game Mode\n2. Went to Desktop Mode and installed all updates\n3. Restarted in Desktop Mode\n4. Entered BIOS (even here the trackpads were unresponsive) and enabled Battery Storage Mode\n5. Reset controller settings by holding Quick Access + volume down button.\n6. Reset controller settings to default in the settings\n7. Used Repair OS tool in the settings\n8. Factory Reset \n\nAll proved to be ineffective.\n\nThe trackpads used to work without any issues before the right one first stopped working. The most \"explorative\" thing I did with my deck was install Retrodeck but I never actually got it working or loaded any ROMs so it was just empty. Also installed CachyOS to be able to run WuWa before Steam officially added support.\n\nI've had my Steam Deck since Nov last year. I didn't really play games that heavily use trackpads either so now I'm just honestly confused about what triggered the issue.\n\nYou might be wondering why it took me four months to post here. I didn't want to Factory Reset my deck until I had backed up all my media and just didn't have the time to deal with that until recently. That didn't fix it as well hence this post.\n\nOn top of all that, I live in a SEA country where it's really hard to find shops that repair steam decks, if there even is any.\n\nIf anyone has experienced this issue or something similar and solved it, kindly drop your solutions below. Thank you. :(",

I looked around on here and some people suggest turning off Bluetooth. And that works for me.\n\nBut I mostly play docked. And I only use my xbox one controller. So I have no idea what wakes it up. I checked the blue tooth and nothing is connected. Ive connected headphones before but they are not on or connected now. It's very annoying. I basically have to turn blue tooth off and then push sleep(instead of doing it via my controller).\n\nAny help would be appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "Hello! I‚Äôve been lurking in this community since I got my steam deck last year when I was 21. The main driving force behind me getting a steam deck was because I simply have no room for a PC desk set up right now. A big reason for me picking one up is because many people praised the device for its emulation capabilities. I became obsessed with the deck when I first got it. (I have a 512gb Oled with a 512sd card) it was so beautiful! And just the sheer knowledge of knowing that any game I bought from steam would follow me to my ultimate goal of owning a PC, made me addicted. I got so wrapped up in playing FF7 and Dave the Diver that emulation completely slipped my mind until almost 1 whole year later. Now I‚Äôm feeling a little bit of FOMO for the switch 2, and a little jealous that they get Mario Galaxy 1 & 2. Then it hit me, I could just emulate it. After setting up emu deck I realized that for a whole year I was just scratching the surface on this thing. It surprises me all the time! Also Quick Resume saves my life‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I can get another device if it doesn‚Äôt have it. I need my little steam deck reward between chores. What‚Äôs a steam deck feature that never ceases to amaze you? ",

As I'm not a huge gamer (Fulltime job, 4 kids, horses and dogs), my playing time is rather limited. I only have an Xbox Series S but I hope with a handheld I might get more playtime (e.g. when kids/wife are watching TV I can't play Xbox...so...). Also not really into AAA games at full/max settings (the Series S can't handle that anyway)\n\nConsidering this, I don't want to spend too much. \n\nCurrently, in some online stores, the Legion Go S Z2 Go SteamOS edition is sold at 399‚Ç¨. So I'm really considering this. But I read that fan noise can go up quite a bit.\n\nHence I'm also looking into the Steam Deck LCD (might get the OLED) which seems quieter. Even if older and not quite as performant, I figure that for my use case it will be enough. \n\nI plan to play in bed while wifey is asleep. So Fan noise is a HUGE factor for me.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nRegards",

But seeing how simple the installer was, I figured it may be more useful to the wider community if I wrote a small script that patches the official SteamOS recovery installer to sort of automate this instead.  \nThis script of mine lets you keep Windows intact on the first partitions and dual boot a SteamOS install without losing a day reinstalling everything.\n\nüëâ GitHub project: [https://github.com/Josh5/steamos\\_dual\\_boot\\_installer\\_patch](https://github.com/Josh5/steamos_dual_boot_installer_patch)  \nüëâ Demo video (rough quality, sorry ‚Äî I write code, not make YouTube videos üòÖ): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVW2MKR5cNk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVW2MKR5cNk)\n\n# Preparing your Windows install\n\nThis script assumes you‚Äôve already created free space on your SSD. I don‚Äôt go deep into that part because there are already good guides out there, but here are two references:\n\nI think this YouTube guide has pretty clear details on the Windows prep: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1fPA2FJRdA&t=244s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1fPA2FJRdA&t=244s) (relevant part from 4:04 -> 7:42)\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Resize the Windows partition**\n   * Disable device encryption in **Settings > Privacy & Security > Device Encryption**.\n   * Open **Disk Management**.\n   * Right-click the **C:** partition -> **Shrink Volume**.\n   * Enter the amount of space to free (I shrank mine to \\~700 GB). Note: values are entered in MB.\n   * ‚ö†Ô∏è If your C: drive is nearly full, shrinking can fail. Free up as much space as possible (uninstall games, etc.) before trying again.\n2. **Disable Fast Startup in Windows**\n   * Go to **Control Panel > Power Options > Choose what the power buttons do**.\n   * Uncheck **‚ÄúTurn on fast startup‚Äù**.\n3. **Disable Secure Boot in BIOS**\n4. **Disable Fast Boot in BIOS**\n5. **Create a SteamOS recovery USB**\n   * Follow Valve‚Äôs official guide: [https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227)\n6. **Boot into the SteamOS recovery USB**\n7. **Open Konsole (terminal) on the recovery desktop**\n8. **Clone my project & run the script**\n9. **Follow the prompts** It will patch the installer to target your new free space.\n10. **Reboot and enjoy SteamOS dual boot without wiping Windows!**\n\nThis has been **tested on the ROG Ally X** and should also work on the **Lenovo Legion Go**. Feedback welcome if you try it on other devices.\n\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è The script needs there to be an \"unallocated\" section of your disk. If you get part way through and things fail or something goes wrong, the script will need that you clean up the partitions that it creates and return back to just having the unallocated space. \n\n",

    "selftext": "The biggest selling point for purchasing my Steam Deck was the promise of quality gyro aiming in any game I wanted through \"Steam Inputs\" that the device can reasonably support. The Deck, has not disappointed in that regard. It has made so many action shooters I've played on the platform so fun! Regardless, if I played it for the 1st time or 100th time. Offering significantly better aiming experiences in these titles than they originally ever had with a controller before. While not needing any aim assist. Including a lot of the older ones. Though, the newer shooters benefit just as much. I'd even argue it is more immersive and satisfying as well.\n\n \"Tomb Raider\" (2013), has be been no exception. Just thought I'd share one of the biggest reasons why I love my Steam Deck with the community. How much of a game changer this feature has been for me personally. People give Nintendo all the praise for gyro controls. However, it's my opinion, Valve, is leading the way with the Steam Deck and Steam Inputs. As they support the feature fully and keep it updated. Making sure people actually have consistent, quality, fundamental access to it. Offering quality experiences. Valve, seems to understand gyro aims value. Which is awesome! Something the other major gaming platforms are still very far behind in unfortunately. It's not even close. \n\nI love this thing! \n\n[Steam Deck] [Gyro Aim] [Tomb Raider 2013] [No Aim Assist]",

I was stupid and didn't thought about the fact that this new game autosave was going to overwrite the other one with everything on it.\n\nMy question:\n\nIs there a way to retrieve the autosave prior to the moment I started a new game? Am I screwed?\n\n\nWhat I tried so far:\n\nGoing into steam website to check cloud saves. Found that there is only one FFXII_000 file (000 is the autosave, 001 and etc. are the manual saves). I tried opening the save file with the text viewer from Steam Deck desktop view to no avail. Only weird symbols.",

I basically go to work and home, and whenever I do go somewhere I'm the one driving. \n\nLately though, there's days where I get home from work and I'd like to play some games, but I just don't feel like sitting at my desk to play them (which is what first made the SD appealing). I also have quite the backlog on Steam, and I've heard the Deck is great for burning through your backlog. I'm also interested in getting into emulation of older/retro games, since I feel I missed out on a lot of them from not gaming much as a kid.\n\nSo basically, do you think the Steam Deck would be worth it for me?",

Maybe that's why it was playing weirdly?\n\nAnyway, I was hoping to get some help on how I can make my own boot up videos? Any certain video programs? That are free and safe? I used Clipchamp, but I imagine it's not really the optimal program for that.",

I have a lot of games from when I was a kid, and this one in particular has always stuck in my mind because it was the first game I never managed to complete. Over the years, I tried to play it again, but Windows no longer supported it, and even with a virtual machine, there were several graphical issues. I considered playing it on the Steam Deck, since it supports older Windows games better than Windows itself, but unfortunately, the game is multi-disc, and Lutris doesn't support installing games that require more than one disc. I finally came up with the solution: install it on Windows, even though it won't run properly, transfer the files installed on the Steam Deck, and run it on Lutris. Unfortunately Windows 10 didn't even let me install it, but I managed to install it on a virtual machine with Windows XP, I moved the files to the Steam Deck but it still asked me for disk 2 to run the game, but that wasn't a problem, because I can mount it without problems on the Steam Deck, everything worked perfectly and now I can finally play this old game that I've been carrying around (in my head) for too many years. The game works perfectly although the mouse stutters a bit, but I only use that in the menu so it's not a real problem.",

Too  much hand holding, horrible graphics. The switch doesn‚Äôt offer fable, fall out, halo or the last of us. All games on my to play list. \n\n- emulation. For some reason Nintendo makes it impossible to legitimately play their classics. The only way to play Zelda twilight princess is to buy a Wii, buy a marked up version of the game on eBay, buy and older TV that supports RGBA.

The Deck, has not disappointed in that regard. It has made so many action shooters I've played on the platform so fun! Regardless, if I played it for the 1st time or 100th time. Offering significantly better aiming experiences in these titles than they originally ever had with a controller before. While not needing any aim assist. Including a lot of the older ones. Though, the newer shooters benefit just as much. I'd even argue it is more immersive and satisfying as well.\n\n \"Tomb Raider\" (2013), has be been no exception. Just thought I'd share one of the biggest reasons why I love my Steam Deck with the community. How much of a game changer this feature has been for me personally. People give Nintendo all the praise for gyro controls. However, it's my opinion, Valve, is leading the way with the Steam Deck and Steam Inputs. As they support the feature fully and keep it updated. Making sure people actually have consistent, quality, fundamental access to it. Offering quality experiences. Valve, seems to understand gyro aims value. Which is awesome! Something the other major gaming platforms are still very far behind in unfortunately. It's not even close. \n\nI love this thing! \n\n[Steam Deck] [Gyro Aim] [Tomb Raider 2013] [No Aim Assist]",

Before you weep for me, do not worry. I fully plan to own a steam deck for the rest of my life to make up for it.\n\nTL;DR: Buy a steam deck, and live a happy life.",

But..\n\nI figured the main appeal of a handheld gaming device is to play on the go, right? Granted, I haven't had a handheld since the DS Lite. However, I never travel. I basically go to work and home, and whenever I do go somewhere I'm the one driving. \n\nLately though, there's days where I get home from work and I'd like to play some games, but I just don't feel like sitting at my desk to play them (which is what first made the SD appealing). I also have quite the backlog on Steam, and I've heard the Deck is great for burning through your backlog. I'm also interested in getting into emulation of older/retro games, since I feel I missed out on a lot of them from not gaming much as a kid.\n\nSo basically, do you think the Steam Deck would be worth it for me?",

I'm not hating it but I'm some what addicted.\n\nSo again I'm sitting here with my steam deck holding forwards and walking through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape and my mind is wondering. I kinda want play a bit of street fighter 6. But I know if I stop playing Death Stranding there's a really big chance I might not come back to it for months. So I keep walking forwards, almost begrudgingly.\n\nThinking back to NMS, I can't remember what I was doing and what I planning to do next. If I boot that up again it might as well be someone else's save. So i probably need to start again. I was about 30 or 40 hours in. That would be the 3rd time I've started NMS again.\n\nThe list goes further back. Death Loop, Disco Elysium (started that around 4 times!), factorio, Dave the diver (I'm almost at the end and then I suddenly dropped it), dredge, elden ring, Kingdom come deliverance, jedi survivor. The last game I finished was Prey, which was excellent.\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue? What do you do? I wonder if it's worth keeping a game diary but honestly it seems like a lot of effort and kinda overkill for a casual endeavor. I don't have ADHD or anything...I don't think.\n\n\n\n",

I thought that to activate FSR I should run the game at lower resolution than the screen,  correct?

    "selftext": "The biggest selling point for purchasing my Steam Deck was the promise of quality gyro aiming in any game I wanted through \"Steam Inputs\" that the device can reasonably support. The Deck, has not disappointed in that regard. It has made so many action shooters I've played on the platform so fun! Regardless, if I played it for the 1st time or 100th time. Offering significantly better aiming experiences in these titles than they originally ever had with a controller before. While not needing any aim assist. Including a lot of the older ones. Though, the newer shooters benefit just as much. I'd even argue it is more immersive and satisfying as well.\n\n \"Tomb Raider\" (2013), has be been no exception. Just thought I'd share one of the biggest reasons why I love my Steam Deck with the community. How much of a game changer this feature has been for me personally. People give Nintendo all the praise for gyro controls. However, it's my opinion, Valve, is leading the way with the Steam Deck and Steam Inputs. As they support the feature fully and keep it updated. Making sure people actually have consistent, quality, fundamental access to it. Offering quality experiences. Valve, seems to understand gyro aims value. Which is awesome! Something the other major gaming platforms are still very far behind in unfortunately. It's not even close. \n\nI love this thing! \n\n[Steam Deck] [Gyro Aim] [Tomb Raider 2013] [No Aim Assist]",

When the steam deck first came out, I was excited like the rest of you. I somehow convinced myself from making the purchase when it first got released back in 2022. I have a beast of a PC, why would I need one? If I am going to be out and have extra time, I can just get some reading done instead of gaming.\n\nWell, now I am a mom and I figured I would treat myself to the OLED. My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby. Back to a time without all the responsibilities I carry now, I could have endlessly enjoyed the steam deck. I missed out on three years of being able to potato on the couch after a hard day at work. Before you weep for me, do not worry. I fully plan to own a steam deck for the rest of my life to make up for it.\n\nTL;DR: Buy a steam deck, and live a happy life.",

I basically go to work and home, and whenever I do go somewhere I'm the one driving. \n\nLately though, there's days where I get home from work and I'd like to play some games, but I just don't feel like sitting at my desk to play them (which is what first made the SD appealing). I also have quite the backlog on Steam, and I've heard the Deck is great for burning through your backlog. I'm also interested in getting into emulation of older/retro games, since I feel I missed out on a lot of them from not gaming much as a kid.\n\nSo basically, do you think the Steam Deck would be worth it for me?",

I'm not hating it but I'm some what addicted.\n\nSo again I'm sitting here with my steam deck holding forwards and walking through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape and my mind is wondering. I kinda want play a bit of street fighter 6. But I know if I stop playing Death Stranding there's a really big chance I might not come back to it for months. So I keep walking forwards, almost begrudgingly.\n\nThinking back to NMS, I can't remember what I was doing and what I planning to do next. If I boot that up again it might as well be someone else's save. So i probably need to start again. I was about 30 or 40 hours in. That would be the 3rd time I've started NMS again.\n\nThe list goes further back. Death Loop, Disco Elysium (started that around 4 times!), factorio, Dave the diver (I'm almost at the end and then I suddenly dropped it), dredge, elden ring, Kingdom come deliverance, jedi survivor. The last game I finished was Prey, which was excellent.\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue? What do you do? I wonder if it's worth keeping a game diary but honestly it seems like a lot of effort and kinda overkill for a casual endeavor. I don't have ADHD or anything...I don't think.\n\n\n\n",

I will continue to own and lease the house, so I still want to have a few things automated.  One such thing is outside lighting, which currently runs on a dusk/dawn schedule controlled by a light switch that is z-wave.\n\nSo, I want to swap that switch for something in the decora form-factor that has an astronomical timer that continuously adjusts the daily schedule for dusk/dawn.  This is how I did it years ago (lived in this house for 18 years) before I had a hub and devices, but I was always annoyed that eventually the internal battery would die and the clock and schedule would get messed up after a power outage.\n\nI'm looking for a similar device that has WiFi capability, only really needed for the purpose of setting the clock from an NTP server after power outage.  Otherwise, I would prefer the device not depend on the cloud for scheduling, etc...\n\nAny suggestions?",

Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey ‚Äî I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. üôè\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this?

    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! üòä)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It‚Äôs not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt want to give up gardening‚Äîespecially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations ‚Äî this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier‚Äôs water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125‚Äì250 m¬≥/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot ‚Äì all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 ‚Äì 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I‚Äôm Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it‚Äôs possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I‚Äôd love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I‚Äôm really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I‚Äôm planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant‚Äôs growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. ‚ÄûThis is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?‚Äú\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can‚Äôt physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It‚Äôs not overkill‚Äîit‚Äôs my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. ‚ÄûThis must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou‚Äôre right, it does. This isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. ‚ÄûIs it still ‚Äögrowing‚Äò if everything is automated?‚Äú\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn‚Äôt just manual labor‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. ‚ÄûWhat happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. ‚ÄûWhy go public with something like this?‚Äú\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it‚Äôs possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. ‚ÄûWhy not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?‚Äú\r\n-\tFor many, that‚Äôs a great option‚Äîbut not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can‚Äôt reach into the tent. It‚Äôs not about convenience; it‚Äôs a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. ‚ÄûDo you have any pictures of the build process itself?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things‚Äîthe automation, the code, and making it accessible‚Äîthat we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚Äöbuild‚Äò for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I‚Äôll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. ‚ÄûHow do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn‚Äôt the power draw a major issue?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot‚Äîa task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7‚Äì4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîit could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like ‚Äûoverkill‚Äú to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn‚Äôt replace my involvement‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn‚Äôt about being lazy; it‚Äôs about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather). The fingerprint access is the reason I bought them at the time, and it rarely works (even when I reprogram the lock, it forgets my prints in a week or two). I will not buy another Utec and when I searched the group that's what people recommended.  \nWe are looking for a deadbolt replacement lock (no handle / knob needed) that has fingerprint and bluetooth (no wifi).

I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child.

The gate lock uses an electric strike (if that‚Äôs the right term).\n\nI‚Äôd like to replace the current system with a smart doorbell that has a camera and allows remote access (via app). Power is already available at the gate, and the electric strike works fine.\n\nMy idea was to install a mobile LTE/5G router at the gate to provide Wi-Fi there and then use a device like Ring or a similar system for the video doorbell.\n\nMy questions:\n\t‚Ä¢\tWould you approach this differently?\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny recommendations for specific brands or systems?\n\t‚Ä¢\tCan a system like Ring, Nuki (or similar) actually control an electric strike, or would I need a different setup for that part?\n\t‚Ä¢\tIdeally, I‚Äôd like one provider for both the gate doorbell and a smart doorbell/lock at the main house door, to keep everything within one ecosystem, or do you think that having different systems does not make a huge difference?\n\nThanks a lot for any tips or setups that worked well for you!",

    "selftext": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI'd like to share my open-source project **Proxmox-GitOps**, a Container Automation platform for provisioning and orchestrating Linux containers (LXC) on Proxmox VE - encapsulated as comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC).\n\n**Proxmox-GitOps (@Github)**: [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps)\n¬†\n* **Demo** (~1m): [https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY](https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY)\n\n* **Demo** (low, no ads): [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif)\n\n\n**TL;DR**: By encapsulating infrastructure within an extensible monorepository - recursively resolved from Git submodules at runtime - Proxmox-GitOps provides a comprehensive Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) abstraction for an entire, automated, container-based infrastructure.\n\nOriginally, it was a personal attempt to bring industrial automation and cloud patterns to my Proxmox home server. It's designed as a platform architecture for a self-contained, bootstrappable system - a generic IaC abstraction (customize, extend, .. open standards, base package only, .. - you name it üòâ) that automates the entire infrastructure. It was initially driven by the question of what a Proxmox-based GitOps automation could look like and how it could be organized.\n\n**Core Concepts**\n\n* **Recursive Self-management**: Control plane seeds itself by pushing its monorepository onto a locally bootstrapped instance, triggering a pipeline that recursively provisions the control plane onto PVE.\n\n* **Monorepository**: Centralizes infrastructure as comprehensive IaC artifact (for mirroring, like the project itself on Github) using submodules for modular composition.\n\n* **Git as State**: Git repository represents the desired infrastructure state.\n\n* **Loose coupling**: Containers are decoupled from the control plane, enabling runtime replacement and independent operation.\n\nOver the past few months, the project stabilized, and I‚Äôve addressed many questions you had in Wiki, summarized to documentation, which should now covers essential technical, conceptual, and practical aspects. I‚Äôve also added a short demo that breaks down the theory by demonstrating the automation of an IaC stack (Home Assistant, Mosquitto bridge, Zigbee2MQTT broker, snapshot restore, reverse proxy, dynamically configured via PVE API), with automated container system updates and service checks.\n\n**What am I looking for?** It's a noncommercial, passion-driven project. I'm looking to collaborate with other engineers who share the excitement of building a self-contained, bootstrappable platform architecture that addresses the question: What should our home automation look like?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts!",

I had set up some simple notifications to our phones like over fire when temp > 800F and reload when temp < 250F, but it was a bit of a pain to pull my phone out throughout the night to keep tabs on the stove. Tonight, I mapped the temperature reading to a hue value on the hue/sat color wheel and setup an automation to gradually adjust a virtually unused wyze color bulb in the corner for a visual stove temperature indication. After burn #1 with it in place, I'm pretty satisfied! Blue = cold, green = target, red = hot. With the hue mapping, color gradually adjusts every 30s in small increments throughout the burn.\n\n  \nFull write up here: [https://houndhillhomestead.com/smart-light-wood-stove-temperature-indication/](https://houndhillhomestead.com/smart-light-wood-stove-temperature-indication/)\n\nAnd original stove monitoring write up here: [https://houndhillhomestead.com/woodstove-temperature-monitoring/](https://houndhillhomestead.com/woodstove-temperature-monitoring/)",

    "title": "My impression of SmartWings shades",
    "selftext": "The other day I got into a convo wth another Redditor who asked in this sub some specifics about SmartWings shades. I bought some earlier this year for a couple of the bedrooms and then installed a set in my home office yesterday, so I thought I would write a longer review.\n\nMy smarthome setup consists of Google Home, a Hubitat hub, and primarily Z-Wave Plus products. All of my SmartWings shades have Z-Wave Plus motors. In the bedrooms I installed 90% blackout Zebra shades. Yesterday I installed a 70% blackout woven wood roller shade in my home office.\n\nWhen ordering there's a good bit of information to fill in and a number of choices to make, so be sure to allow yourself a sufficient block of time. The fabric colors are clearly outlined but it's not always easy to make a proper comparison from a PC or phone. You can order a book of fabric samples, which I did prior to placing my second order.\n\nThe measuring instructions are clear and there's no need to overcompensate for anything. I added the minimum suggested amount to the window length and the side blackout works great. For the Zebra shade height I overcompensated and ended up having to mount the Zebra shades higher than originally planned because the bedroom window sills jut out a bit. The Zebra shades have to be mounted at an exact height so that the fabric lines up correctly when the shade is fully closed.  If there's no obstruction like a window sill then that won't really matter, but in my case it did and I measured too long, That was user error on my part. Just measure the window height and add the suggested amount for the mounts. There's no need to add any length past that.\n\nShipping takes a few weeks since they come from China. Once the order is marked as in transit, the shipment arrives within a few days.\n\nInstallation is easy, unless you measure too long like I did. :D There are a handful of brackets to install for the Zebra shades, and if you order an outside mount like I did, there are extenders to install as well. The woven wood shade that I ordered recently is even easier to install, with brackets only and a top-down connection. I recommend having an installation buddy for any blind wider than a single window. The blinds aren't heavy but if lengthy they can be unwieldy to hold solo.\n\nConnecting to the home network is easy, requiring only the app for your hub and the appropriate PIN or ID for the device.\n\nI didn't get the solar chargers on any of the blinds, figuring I would just charge them as needed. Thus far I've only had to charge the bedroom blinds twice in 8 months. \n\nI've been highly satisfied with the blinds in the bedrooms, and the newly installed woven wood shade in my office is working great as well.  These blinds are on the pricier side but the quality is excellent and the setup is easy.\n\nOne other note: at first I was using my ADT alarm system as the hub and not Hubitat.  Google Home wouldn't recognize the blinds even though they had been added to ADT successfully. Of ADT, Google, and SmartWings, only the SmartWings customer service rep seemed to have any clue a to what was going on. ADT's response was \"sorry we don't sell that product so I can't help you.\" Google customer support told me to disconnect and reconnect ADT even though I plainly told them that I'd already tried that, and when it still didn't work they said \"oh that's too bad thanks bye.\" Ha. The SmartWings chat rep listened to what was going on and correctly suspected that the ADT controller wasn't properly communicating the presence of the blinds with Google Home. They recommended that I switch my hub to either Google Hub or one of their other supported hubs. I went with Hubitat and now it all works great.\n\nBottom line, SmartWings are solid and easy to set up smart blinds.",

    "title": "How to Design a System for my Home?",
    "selftext": "Hello, I‚Äôm under contract for a new home and will gain access in a couple of weeks. I‚Äôm feeling a tiny bit overwhelmed. I have what I would consider above average tech skills. I‚Äôm a software engineer by trade writing web apps, and I first learned to code on Arduino over a decade ago so I have decent programming and cursory electronics skills (I could install a WiFi relay or something of similar complexity without help). I used to have my whole place set up with WiFi bulbs and a WiFi thermostat connected to google home and do enjoy the benefits of smart home features (though WiFi bulbs were kind of a pain and I‚Äôm excited to control things at the switch instead). \n\nI‚Äôm interested in designing a home automation system throughout the home that far exceeds what I‚Äôve been able to do previously as a renter. Part of that means I want to set up a network rack and run cat 6 cabling throughout the house. I want to make good choices early so I don‚Äôt have to upgrade later, but I‚Äôm having trouble deciding what that means for my project. \n\nThe house is a 4 story townhome in the the middle of a city so I do want some cameras and security features, but I don‚Äôt have a yard, just a 1 car garage. I think maybe having PoE run everywhere is the right way to do it? I have a little bit of an attention deficit and replacing batteries in a bunch of devices is a hassle. \n\nI also need a little advice on how to figure out what‚Äôs already been set up, the house has a Bluetooth speaker system throughout, and there were some digital intercom screens set up in a few rooms but they appeared to be turned off we did the tour/inspection. \n\nThere‚Äôs also the matter of hardware and software choices. I‚Äôve heard great things about the unifi ubiquiti platform and would like to try a nice network setup as a backbone for the project, and I‚Äôm excited to build on an open sourced platform like home assistant. I tried having a conversation with an LLM about hardware and some things like a dedicated firewall seem like overkill? It‚Äôs tough to right size a system without having seen common setups before.\n\nAll of these variables have led me into a bit of an analysis paralysis, I wanted to start home lab-ing a bit in preparation but can‚Äôt decide what parts of the project I can get a head start on or if I should just wait to get the keys. I feel if I wait too long to run the cat6 I might have to do it after our stuff is moved in making things a little harder (I have a month and a half or so of overlap to move), but I figure getting someone out here to do the work twice will cost more so I should figure out how many ports I‚Äôm going to have them drop quickly. \n\nMostly just looking for general advice, tips, or other experiences to learn from on how to properly design and diagram everything and come up with a semblance of a plan going into the new home. Help!",

    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! üòä)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It‚Äôs not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt want to give up gardening‚Äîespecially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations ‚Äî this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier‚Äôs water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125‚Äì250 m¬≥/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot ‚Äì all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 ‚Äì 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I‚Äôm Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it‚Äôs possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I‚Äôd love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I‚Äôm really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I‚Äôm planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant‚Äôs growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. ‚ÄûThis is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?‚Äú\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can‚Äôt physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It‚Äôs not overkill‚Äîit‚Äôs my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. ‚ÄûThis must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou‚Äôre right, it does. This isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. ‚ÄûIs it still ‚Äögrowing‚Äò if everything is automated?‚Äú\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn‚Äôt just manual labor‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. ‚ÄûWhat happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. ‚ÄûWhy go public with something like this?‚Äú\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it‚Äôs possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. ‚ÄûWhy not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?‚Äú\r\n-\tFor many, that‚Äôs a great option‚Äîbut not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can‚Äôt reach into the tent. It‚Äôs not about convenience; it‚Äôs a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. ‚ÄûDo you have any pictures of the build process itself?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things‚Äîthe automation, the code, and making it accessible‚Äîthat we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚Äöbuild‚Äò for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I‚Äôll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. ‚ÄûHow do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn‚Äôt the power draw a major issue?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot‚Äîa task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7‚Äì4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîit could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like ‚Äûoverkill‚Äú to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn‚Äôt replace my involvement‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn‚Äôt about being lazy; it‚Äôs about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Help identifying Danfoss radiator valve types + correct adapters for tado X (Denmark, district heating)",
    "selftext": "Hi all ‚Äî hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI‚Äôve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won‚Äôt be an issue ‚Äî my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30√ó1.5?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss‚ÜíM30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you‚Äôve used?\n\nWhat I‚Äôve tried / extra info:\n\t‚Ä¢\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay‚Ä¶).\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don‚Äôt seat correctly on several valves.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t‚Ä¢\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t‚Ä¢\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey ‚Äî I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. üôè\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can‚Äôt figure out the chart :(",

The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather). The fingerprint access is the reason I bought them at the time, and it rarely works (even when I reprogram the lock, it forgets my prints in a week or two).

Can the Drayton system do this too?\n\nThere's one particular room in the house where the valves aren't compatible with the TRVs so could the room stat from Drayton be placed in that room and if it gets cold call for heat whilst the other rooms if not needed keep their valves shut?\n\nThanks",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! üòä)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It‚Äôs not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt want to give up gardening‚Äîespecially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations ‚Äî this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier‚Äôs water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125‚Äì250 m¬≥/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot ‚Äì all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 ‚Äì 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I‚Äôm Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it‚Äôs possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I‚Äôd love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I‚Äôm really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I‚Äôm planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant‚Äôs growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. ‚ÄûThis is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?‚Äú\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can‚Äôt physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It‚Äôs not overkill‚Äîit‚Äôs my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. ‚ÄûThis must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou‚Äôre right, it does. This isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. ‚ÄûIs it still ‚Äögrowing‚Äò if everything is automated?‚Äú\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn‚Äôt just manual labor‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. ‚ÄûWhat happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. ‚ÄûWhy go public with something like this?‚Äú\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it‚Äôs possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. ‚ÄûWhy not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?‚Äú\r\n-\tFor many, that‚Äôs a great option‚Äîbut not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can‚Äôt reach into the tent. It‚Äôs not about convenience; it‚Äôs a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. ‚ÄûDo you have any pictures of the build process itself?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things‚Äîthe automation, the code, and making it accessible‚Äîthat we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚Äöbuild‚Äò for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I‚Äôll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. ‚ÄûHow do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn‚Äôt the power draw a major issue?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot‚Äîa task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7‚Äì4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîit could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like ‚Äûoverkill‚Äú to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn‚Äôt replace my involvement‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn‚Äôt about being lazy; it‚Äôs about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay‚Ä¶).\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don‚Äôt seat correctly on several valves.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t‚Ä¢\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t‚Ä¢\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey ‚Äî I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. üôè\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can‚Äôt figure out the chart :(",

I have two in my bedroom and have wanted to automate these with the rest of my set up for a really long time now, however I'm broke and can't afford to shell out $150 for something like this:  \n[https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Blind-Tilt-Motorized-Blinds/dp/B0BMLFZ4CP](https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Blind-Tilt-Motorized-Blinds/dp/B0BMLFZ4CP)\n\npersonally it makes 0 sense to me that a motor that rotates a blind would cost this much. Any suggestions that are more cost effective, or potentially anyone willing to sell something similar at a cheaper price? I'll still happily quote something fair. Not sure whether this is something I should take up my first DIY project on",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

Any reviews from anyone using these in their home ? \n\nLink provided in case you‚Äôre are curious.

Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

I saw that the company shut down or something like that. I have zero interest in any complicated set ups to make it work again so I'm looking to replace them. What are some good budget replacements? Something bright but it doesn't have to be crazy. RGB isn't necessary but I did enjoy switching to red lights whenever I felt overstimulated. „Ö§Need 4. \n\nI loved the simple operation of the Sengled bulbs being controlled from my phone with Google Assistant or through the app. \n\n2. Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up? Something without a subscription.\n\n  \nAdded request - We're using a really old camera system. I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription. I don't live in the US and spending USD adds up really quick with forex limits.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nPS.

Calibration and monitoring etc. etc.  A fair amount of reviews suggest they can be unreliable and the internal impeller is a bit fragile. \n\nDoes anyone make a simple remote controlled shutoff valve that I can use to easily shut off the water when we are away on vacation or just out of the house for more than a few hours?",

Most discuss price, fabric, etc. \n\n  \nI was wondering if someone could compare the different brands (Lutron, Eve, Hunter Douglas, Garber from Costco, Smartwings) looking at only two factors: \n\n1. Quietness of the motor (relative to Lutron, which I'll consider as the gold standard)\n\n2. Compatibility with Apple Home (everything I have currently is in the Homekit ecosystem - 4 apple TVs, 4 apple homepods, 20+ lutron lights, merross garage openers, etc)\n\n  \nI don't mind spending the money for Lutron shades, but just want to make sure there isn't a cheaper alternative that is nearly as good.

    "selftext": "I've wired the ZBMINIR2's in to other boilers previously, just replacing the default relay with the ZBMINI. My current boiler is wired up differently however.\n\nThe first picture is the default setup. The white wire in the trunking is Live In. The white on the left goes in to the relay (to trigger the central heating), and the white on the right goes from the relay to the boiler. The Black is permanent live to the boiler for hot water.\n\nThe second picture is using WAGO connecters instead of the standard connector, hot water works fine.\n\nThe third picture shows how the relay is wired (there's a piece that plugs in to connect and control). My assumption was that I could just swap that Live/Neutral on the left to the inputs on the ZBMINIR2, and then the Live/Neutral on the right to the outputs, and everything should work.\n\nWith just the inputs, the ZBMINIR2 'works' fine, in that I can see it and toggle it in HomeAssistant. However the issue is that whenever I power the boiler on with the outputs connected, my RCD trips instantly.\n\n  \nHoping for some advice on what I'm doing wrong, because I am perplexed.",

Circles represent lights, split into circuits that I‚Äôve colour coded. \n\nWhen I leave for work, it‚Äôs dark, and I currently have to turn on and off about a million switches to light my way to the front door. \n\nWhat i would like is an extra switch next to ‚ÄòGreen Circuit Switch 2‚Äô that turns on and off ALL the lights between the kitchen and the front door. I would like another extra switch next to ‚ÄòBlue Circuit Switch 1‚Äô that does the same. \n\nI still want to be able to control each circuit separately too. \n\nI have a WiFi mesh system that supports Matter. I also have a Tapo hub and a NAS running home assistant. I‚Äôm planning to get an Apple TV at some point too. \n\nI don‚Äôt mind setting up automations but i want physical switches rather than PIR triggered lights. \n\nI think I need a combination of smart switches and relays?  Like, a smart switch at each far end, combined with a smart relay hidden behind the regular lighting panels of the other circuits. And when I hit either of the smart switches, the relays are all automated to turn on or off. \n\nIs that right?! What‚Äôs the best way to run such an automation? Or is there a better solution?\n\nThank you!\n",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hello there. I have had success using the Lutron Caseta switches with the hub plugged into my router. I have been using water sensors with Samsung Smart Things but, even with the zigbee protocol the devices go offline frequently and don‚Äôt create the mesh I was looking to create. \n\nSo I found the YoLink starter kit on Amazon. Has anyone had any experiences with these sensors and hub ? They are using LoRa to provide connectivity. And use AAA batteries not the lithium ones the Samsung sensors require. \n\nI also am using Google home and have downloaded the app. And it is integrated. I just need to buy the devices. Any reviews from anyone using these in their home ? \n\nLink provided in case you‚Äôre are curious. Amazon has this kit for $10.00 less than the manufacturer \n\nThis YoLink starter kit includes a hub and 4 water leak sensors that provide SMS, email, and push notifications to help prevent water damage. \n\nhttps://a.co/d/ehedlNH\n\n",

Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

I have two in my bedroom and have wanted to automate these with the rest of my set up for a really long time now, however I'm broke and can't afford to shell out $150 for something like this:  \n[https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Blind-Tilt-Motorized-Blinds/dp/B0BMLFZ4CP](https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Blind-Tilt-Motorized-Blinds/dp/B0BMLFZ4CP)\n\npersonally it makes 0 sense to me that a motor that rotates a blind would cost this much. Any suggestions that are more cost effective, or potentially anyone willing to sell something similar at a cheaper price? I'll still happily quote something fair.

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

I thought, ‚ÄúPerfect ‚Äî good company name, stable role, and near family.‚Äù But today I came across a Google review (as given below üëá) that completely ruined my excitement.\n\n*********************[[[[[[[\nAmway Madurai IT Contract: Toxic &\nUnprofessional - O/5, Avoid\nPlant: Immaculate, disciplined.\nIT Team: Politics-driven chaos, manipulation over merit. Lacks skills/professionalism; drains energy, blocks growth.\nCulprits:\nSaravanan: Polite facade, unskilled schemer via backroom tactics.\nVinoth: Boundary-violator, inappropriate advances amid personal failures.\nRajkumar: Disengaged, unreliable burden from apparent habits.\nNew Joiners: Pause extensively-risks career/well-being.\nAmway: Reform urgently. Choose better environments.\n\n]]]]]*********************\n\n\nThe review described the Amway Madurai IT team as toxic, unprofessional, politics-driven, and even named people with bad behavior. It made me doubt everything.\n\nNow I‚Äôm stuck between:\n\nStaying near home and risking a toxic environment that could affect my career or mental health, or\n\nMoving far away to Chennai for a startup (new city, new challenges, but maybe more growth).\n\n\nHonestly, I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt want to regret my decision later ‚Äî either by choosing stability and getting stuck, or by moving away and struggling in an unstable startup.\n\nIf anyone here has worked in Amway Madurai IT or faced something similar ‚Äî please share your thoughts.\nHow do you usually decide between comfort (near home) and potential growth (far away)?\n\nAny honest advice or personal experiences would really help me right now. üôè",

This scan also on occasion states all ok.\n* Running 'Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth' brings up  - \"Error: 0x800f0915The repair content could not be found anywhere.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI have been having issues for the last few weeks that have me pulling my hair out. Whenever I start my PC up, I will get an error code that causes a restart. This will repeat with a different error each time. Eventually, after like 3 or 4 cycles of this, I'll finally be able to get in, and then everything seems to work just fine. It usually crashes right as I'm signing into Windows, but sometimes it'll just freeze, and I'll have to do a hard shutoff. Once it starts up, there are usually no issues, but very rarely it will let me in but still crash within the first 30 second of using it. It consistently takes multiple attempts and never starts up without an error on the first attempt. \n\nThis started happening after I changed my CPU from an i7-12700k to an i5-14600k, but I don't recall it happening for the first week or two. I have reset Windows (the option that keeps my files). Windows is fully updated, the BIOS is updated, and I have tried to update all drivers I can think of. MemTest86 didn't detect any issues, and neither did Prime95. None of the various troubleshooters have detected anything, either. \n\nI have uploaded the minidumps I've collected in the last week below. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!\n\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/26xf6udpftl9nve/Minidump.zip/file",

    "title": "VRM Thermal Pads melted, black screen when launching games, is my GPU cooked?",
    "selftext": "To preface, I have a 3080 FTW Ultra that I got in early 2021 powered by a SF750 SFX.\n\nSo I had been running FanControl for a while to run a fan profile on my case fans / GPU, but I guess a recent update had knocked out its ability to read sensor data correctly. Last Thursday while playing BF6 for idk an hour or so, one match I went to load into and my screen went blank but discord etc remained working. I tried win+shift+ctrl+b to reset the driver and it did nothing, so I had to hard restart the computer. When it rebooted, there was a windows update (of course) and then I noticed there was an nvidia driver update dated Oct 14 that was available so I downloaded it, and resumed gaming.\n\nThe next day, while playing some BF6 again I could hear my fans running like crazy, opened up fancontrol and saw the notification indicating the sensor reading issue and that it needed an update to allow it to properly read sensor data - fancontrol said my GPU was at like idk 45C but HWinfo had it at 88C, the hotspot was around 100C, I have no clue what it was while running BF6 since I had quit the game immediately when I heard the fans. Updated fan control, redid my fan curves and then launched BF6 again and it was fine. I played Valorant a bit later and was fine. In hindsight I have no clue what temps were when i initially had the first black screen, I‚Äôm unsure if the computer would have just shut off to prevent it from melting entirely or crashing the display driver and stop working would be the way it would handle overheating.\n\nSaturday I had gamed for a lil with zero issues, but then yesterday evening, I launched BF6, sat in the menu and then upon joining a game, black screen. I launched OCCT to try and stress test, black screen again. Mind you the rest of the computer appears to work, just no video output. Restarted, opened MSI afterburner and tried UV a tiny bit (used to have a nice UV for a long while but the profile got deleted on an update maybe sometime in August, didn‚Äôt really worry about redoing it and dialing it in again. Reduced power limit to 90% to see if maybe it was a PSU issue, ran a power test and it was fine, ran the VGA test and it threw an error but I didn‚Äôt get a black screen so I assumed the UV was maybe a tad unstable or something. Launched valorant while my friends were playing, sat in the menu, went to the range and did several rounds and when they were ready I joined their group and the moment it found a match and went to switch screens, black screen again‚Ä¶\n\nSo I took the GPU out, I have no clue what I‚Äôm looking at/for, but I noticed my thermal pads I‚Äôm assuming on my VRMs had melted sometime before last night, I‚Äôd only assume it could have been last Thursday but I‚Äôve had this card for several years (normally under load it would be ~60C or less).\n\nIm assuming thermal pads don‚Äôt melt unless it sustains some bad temps.  Am I cooked, would replacing the thermal pads and putting paste on the GPU even be worth it?  Here is a [a photo of the VRMS and board](https://postimg.cc/HJPsM8hv). I‚Äôm nervous that repeated issues could be causing power spikes / instability and potentially damage my PSU as well.\n\nAnyone out there who could maybe help?",

    "selftext": "First of all i write this with the help of ChapGTP cause english its not my main  language  \n\n\nHello everyone, I'm facing a very strange and frustrating issue with a new SSD, and I could really use some expert advice.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nI bought a **Samsung 990 Evo Plus 2TB** M.2 SSD during the recent Amazon sales. I installed it in the **M2\\_2 slot** of my **MSI B650 Gaming Plus WiFi** motherboard.\n\nInitially, it works fine. I can format it and install games. However, as soon as the drive is put under **any significant load** (e.g., running a game installed on it for 2-3 hours, or attempting a performance test in Samsung Magician), the drive completely crashes.\n\n**The Symptoms:**\n\n1. The drive suddenly appears as **RAW** in Windows Disk Management.\n2. I cannot format the drive, delete the volume, or interact with it at all.\n3. It disappears from utilities like CrystalDiskInfo, but often still shows up in Samsung Magician.\n\n**The Bizarre \"Fix\":**\n\nThe strange part is that **a simple PC restart completely resolves the issue.** After a reboot, the drive reappears, is properly formatted (NTFS), and is fully accessible again, as if nothing happened. I can then reinstall files, only for the issue to repeat under load.\n\n  \n**What I've Done So Far:**\n\n1. **RMA/Replacement:** I initially thought the SSD was faulty, so I RMA'd it with Amazon and received a brand new replacement. **The new drive has the exact same problem.**\n2. **Slot:** The SSD is currently in the **M2\\_2 slot**. The **M2\\_1 slot** is occupied by my boot drive (another M.2 SSD, which works perfectly).\n\n**My Hypothesis & Next Steps:**\n\n* It doesn't seem to be the SSD itself since the replacement failed identically.\n* I suspect the **M2\\_2 slot** on the motherboard might be defective or improperly supplying power/data under continuous load, but the fact that a simple restart \"fixes\" it temporarily is confusing. If the port were broken, I'd expect it to not show up at all.\n* I have purchased a **PCIe M.2 adapter** to test the drive in a standard PCIe slot.\n\nHas anyone with a B650 board experienced similar issues with the secondary M.2 slots? Could this be a **power delivery issue**, a **chipset/driver bug**, or something specific to the **M2\\_2 slot** on this motherboard model?\n\nAny advice on diagnostics or potential BIOS settings to check would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!  \n\n\n\n\n  \n",

The beamer makes the video smaller and shows a border, even though the full projection of the beamer is bigger. Other things like the menu and settings do show full capable size of the projection, but the video doesn't.

We use a media player and have also tried different apps on there, but they all show the same result. \n\nAny help or tips would be very appreciated!\n\n  \nHazel and Robin",

    "title": "PC freezing/crashing/restarting, usually during gaming",
    "selftext": "1. The problem\n2. What I've tried to diagnose/fix\n3. Hardware\n\nI don't have access to other hardware to swap in to test, so if it's a case of buying a new component I'd want to be at least _relatively_ sure it's the culprit before buying one, in case it just changes nothing.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nAs per the title - for ~5 weeks now, my PC has been periodically crashing (usually during (light) gaming) maybe a couple of times a day on average. The first time it did it I was playing Minecraft on one screen and watching a film on another. Both screens went black, then the 2nd monitor came back on with the film frozen. After a couple of minutes both screens went black, then I heard the Windows boot sound but the screens still said no signal. I held the power button down to restart, my main monitor came back but it froze on the POST screen (logo and spinning loading circle, which froze). That happened a couple of times before I got into the BIOS, then Windows offered me startup repair which failed, then a restore which worked.\n\nSince then it hasn't failed to boot like that. The crash/freeze/restart behaviour isn't 100% consistent but falls generally into one of these categories:\n\n1. The screens go black and say no signal. If I'm playing/watching something I can still hear it for a bit. Takes a power-button restart to restart.\n2. The screens go off, then back on (sometimes a couple times) before freezing with one on. Needs to be hard-restarted\n3. The screens go off. After a few seconds, the PC restarts itself\n4. (Only happened ~3 times) the screens blink off then on, frozen, and my GPU fans ramp up to max. Needs a hard-restart\n\nThere's almost always nothing noteworthy in Event Viewer, except one time there was [this WHEA-Logger error](https://pastebin.com/dYX85Pjw). I also have [a log saved from Reliability Monitor](https://pastebin.com/3B8k7tKT).\n\nAs I said above, it's only ever light gaming; Minecraft, some indie/2D games etc.\n\n**Diagnosis/Fix Attempts**\n\n1. DDU and complete driver reinstallation\n2. ~15-minute Furmark GPU stress test\n3. 20-minute OCCT tests on GPU, VRAM, memory, CPU & Storage - no errors reported on any of them (though one time I started a GPU variable load stress test, stopped it after 20 seconds, then when I clicked in OCCT to set up a steady load GPU test it crashed; i.e. when no games were running)\n4. 90% underclock and power limit in MSI Afterburner\n\n**Hardware**\n\n\n\nComponent | Model | Notes\n---|---|----\nCPU | Ryzen 7 5700X3D | Bought from AliExpress, but from a reputable seller on Reddit's advice\nMotherboard| Gigbabyte B550 Aorus Elite V2 | \nRAM | 2 x 16gb Corsair Vengeance LPX 3600 | \nGPU | 980 ti | 2nd hand from a friend 2/3 years ago\nPSU | OCZ ZT 650W | Huh... (see below)\n\nI thought I had a ~1-year-old 850W in the machine, but I guess my ex took that with her PC when she left. So this is my old PSU from maybe 2014? Oops, I'd kinda discounted it possibly being a PSU issue because I didn't realise it wasn't the newer one.",

    "title": "My 32GB USB Stick with CBM2299 Controller is Broken",
    "selftext": "TL;DR I just need a controller for CBM2299.\n\nHey guys, I just bought this usb stick about a week ago and I realized it was on ExFat format so I started to format it to NTFS format, it was kinda taking too long bc i had 10gb info in it and it was 3am so i left my pc open and went to bed. When i checked it in the morning there was a warning saying \"Windows was unable to complete the format\" (or something like that idk) and it wanted me to start the format again so i did. After 1-2 hours, the progress bar was still on 0% so i plugged off the usb (and i probably killed it by doing that). When i plugged it back it was dead and wanted me to insert a disc for D:. I did some researchs and i think its firmware is dead but the usb is alive so have to find and install its firmware again. I found out that it's controller is ChipsBank with CBM2299 number. I checked usbdev.ru and flashboot.ru but the latest program is for CBM2199. I found a controller for CBM2299 but it's in a chinese website and i need a QQ or WeChat account to download it and I'm not even sure if it's safe or not (LMK if you want the link). So basically I need a controller for CBM2299. Can anyone help me find it PLEASE?",

    "selftext": "Hello! I need help troubleshooting a home network problem I've been having for days already. I'll try to explain the problem and what I've done so far, but please ask me any questions if I missed any. I'm no IT professional (but not a newbie either) so please bear with me!\n\nSo PLDT recently had to change our router after it broke. Previously, I've had no trouble connecting a WiFi printer (not a regular inkjet printer, this is a receipt printer) by configuring it with its printer utility and setting it up to connect to our home WiFi. I would set it up to connect via wifi, select the SSID, and set the IP Address (192.168.1.15), Gateway (192.168.1.1), and Subnet Mask (255.255.255.0). And then double check with a self-test to make sure that it's been connected. I can ping it afterwards and connect it to my dev applications no problem.\n\nBut with this new router, I've performed the same steps but I cannot for the life of me get it connect to the network and be found by my PC.\n\nPoints to consider:\n\n1. I cannot ping other devices on the client list too even though they are online and connected to the same band\n2. The printer's self-test confirms that it is connected to the wifi network but apparently no bc I cannot find it in the client list\n3. New router is¬†**HG8145X6-10**¬†made by Huawei\n4. We have no other switches or extenders connected to it, but one of the LANs is connected to cignal.\n5. I can only ping¬†[192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1/)¬†the rest are \\`Destination host unreachable\\`.\n\nChanges I've made:\n\n1. I reserved the¬†[192.168.1.15](http://192.168.1.15/)¬†IP Address for the printer's MAC so the DHCP does not use it to assign to another device.\n2. I turned off the band-steering so the 2.4G and 5G bands are separate\n3. The printer and my PC (that I'm trying to ping it from) are both connected to the 2.4G band.\n4. The printer's utility config cannot detect the 5G band so I'm now stuck pa sa 2.4G\n\nI'm getting an ethernet cable tomorrow to try instead of WiFi but what else can I check? I'm trying to look for some firewall options or literally any reason but I don't know where else to look.",

We know that Windows libraries and the code itself can be modified if necessary.\n\n**My questions for the community**\n\n1. Has anyone implemented observability on modern VB6 applications?\n2. What tools or approaches have worked for extracting telemetry from VB6?\n3. Is it worth instrumenting the VB6 code directly, or is it better to capture metrics at the OS/network level?\n4. Do you know of any APM or observability platform with support (even partial) for VB6?\n\nAny experience, advice, or direction would be greatly appreciated. I understand VB6 is legacy, but the reality is that many companies still have it in production and need modern visibility.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "title": "So Many Bluescreens!",
    "selftext": "So I'm dealing with an issue on my prebuilt CyberPower PC where it will have BSODs when I try to play pretty much any game. I've never had this issue on any other device, and this has been happening since I bought the computer. I didn't immediately send it in for repair because these blue screens were not nearly as intrusive 6 or so months ago when I got the PC (and I had to trade in the previous prebuilt PC I got because it wouldn't power on the day I bought it, which cost an extra $300 for my current one). But the bottom line is, I just don't have the money to spend on a diagnosis AND repair.\n\nThe codes I get are different almost every time, and all of my Google searches have told me it's faulty RAM or a bad driver (which is very unspecific for someone like me), or other hardware issues, etc. I've tried so many possible solutions, none of which have worked for me so far. I'll try to make a list of everything I can remember, but there are most likely things that I have missed.\n\n**List of tried solutions:**\n\n\\- Using DDU to completely uninstall my graphics drivers, then clean reinstall them\n\n\\- Using the memory diagnostic tool, in which no problems were found\n\n\\- Using CrystalDiskInfo to check my disk health, which says it's \"Good\"\n\n\\- A bunch of different commands with the command prompt, mostly \"DISM\" and other repair commands. They actually found things and supposedly repaired them, but I have no idea if it actually helped or was related because I'm still experiencing frequent BSODs.\n\n\\- Disabling overlays from things like Discord and Game Bar\n\n\\- Checking Event Viewer for possible crash reasons, not entirely sure if there was anything there, but I also wasn't sure what I was looking for specifically\n\n**List of things I haven't tried yet because I'm not very tech savvy:**\n\n\\- Updating BIOS\n\n\\- Removing RAM sticks to test them individually\n\n**List of BSOD codes (definitely does not provide all of them from the past 6 months, but there are some I recorded recently)**:  \n\\- IRQL\\_NOT\\_LESS\\_OR\\_EQUAL (0xA) What failed: ntoskrnl.exe\n\n\\- DRIVER\\_IRQL\\_NOT\\_LESS\\_OR\\_EQUAL (0xD1)\n\n\\- REFERENCE\\_BY\\_POINTER (0x18)\n\n\\- SYSTEM\\_SERVICE\\_EXCEPTION What failed: win32kfull.sys\n\n\\- KMODE\\_EXCEPTION\\_NOT\\_HANDLED (0x1E) What failed: dxgmms2.sys\n\n\\- MEMORY\\_MANAGEMENT (0x1A)\n\n\\- APC\\_INDEX\\_MISMATCH\n\nThere are most likely more, but these are what I've found through my picture gallery and messaging friends to see if they can help me, lol.\n\n**And finally, here are my specs:**\n\nCPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 7 265F\n\nRAM: 32 GB DDR5\n\nOS: Windows 11\n\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti\n\n***EDIT AFTER SEEING AUTOMOD COMMENT:*** [Minidump Zip Link!](https://www.mediafire.com/file/iolfyqm8255klfz/Minidump.zip/file)\n\nTL;DR, my prebuilt CyberPower PC blue screens on every game after 5-30 minutes with a different code almost every time. Please let me know if I've missed any important information. Any help is much appreciated, thank you so much!\n\n(I'd also like to mention again that I am not great with computers, so step-by-step instructions would be very helpful)",

    "selftext": "1. The problem\n2. What I've tried to diagnose/fix\n3. Hardware\n\nI don't have access to other hardware to swap in to test, so if it's a case of buying a new component I'd want to be at least _relatively_ sure it's the culprit before buying one, in case it just changes nothing.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nAs per the title - for ~5 weeks now, my PC has been periodically crashing (usually during (light) gaming) maybe a couple of times a day on average. The first time it did it I was playing Minecraft on one screen and watching a film on another. Both screens went black, then the 2nd monitor came back on with the film frozen. After a couple of minutes both screens went black, then I heard the Windows boot sound but the screens still said no signal. I held the power button down to restart, my main monitor came back but it froze on the POST screen (logo and spinning loading circle, which froze). That happened a couple of times before I got into the BIOS, then Windows offered me startup repair which failed, then a restore which worked.\n\nSince then it hasn't failed to boot like that. The crash/freeze/restart behaviour isn't 100% consistent but falls generally into one of these categories:\n\n1. The screens go black and say no signal. If I'm playing/watching something I can still hear it for a bit. Takes a power-button restart to restart.\n2. The screens go off, then back on (sometimes a couple times) before freezing with one on. Needs to be hard-restarted\n3. The screens go off. After a few seconds, the PC restarts itself\n4. (Only happened ~3 times) the screens blink off then on, frozen, and my GPU fans ramp up to max. Needs a hard-restart\n\nThere's almost always nothing noteworthy in Event Viewer, except one time there was [this WHEA-Logger error](https://pastebin.com/dYX85Pjw). I also have [a log saved from Reliability Monitor](https://pastebin.com/3B8k7tKT).\n\nAs I said above, it's only ever light gaming; Minecraft, some indie/2D games etc.\n\n**Diagnosis/Fix Attempts**\n\n1. DDU and complete driver reinstallation\n2. ~15-minute Furmark GPU stress test\n3. 20-minute OCCT tests on GPU, VRAM, memory, CPU & Storage - no errors reported on any of them (though one time I started a GPU variable load stress test, stopped it after 20 seconds, then when I clicked in OCCT to set up a steady load GPU test it crashed; i.e. when no games were running)\n4. 90% underclock and power limit in MSI Afterburner\n\n**Hardware**\n\n\n\nComponent | Model | Notes\n---|---|----\nCPU | Ryzen 7 5700X3D | Bought from AliExpress, but from a reputable seller on Reddit's advice\nMotherboard| Gigbabyte B550 Aorus Elite V2 | \nRAM | 2 x 16gb Corsair Vengeance LPX 3600 | \nGPU | 980 ti | 2nd hand from a friend 2/3 years ago\nPSU | OCZ ZT 650W | Huh... (see below)\n\nI thought I had a ~1-year-old 850W in the machine, but I guess my ex took that with her PC when she left. So this is my old PSU from maybe 2014? Oops, I'd kinda discounted it possibly being a PSU issue because I didn't realise it wasn't the newer one.",

Just generally unstable.\n\nBelow I will try set out what I have found out and actions\n\n* According to the reliability monitor under \"Critical Events\" about the first crash \"Description The previous system shutdown at **12:47:44 on ‚Äé20/‚Äé09/‚Äé2025** was unexpected\" This report is dated **1311 20/09/2025**\n* The monitor then has under \"Warnings\" - \"Problem: Failed Windows Update  Description: Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x800F0991: 2025-09 Cumulative Update for Windows 11 Version 24H2 for x64-based Systems (KB5065426) (26100.6584).\" This is dated **1303 20/09/2025.**\n* There are similar issues on the same day with another crash.\n* Subsequent days show further issues which then start to cause crashes in other software including system tray items and active windows.\n* As mentioned, there is multiple error messages coming up, I don't think I can list them all as its always changing.\n* I have spent about an hour in safe mode whilst doing this post and no crashes.\n\nI have now been trying all sorts-\n\n* I updated the M2 Drive firmware, this was a hassle as the Sandisk software refused to open, but worked around this by running in Win Safe Mode, possibly software not working due to instability (some googling suggests GPU can cause issues opening).\n* All MOBO drivers should also now be uptodate.\n* SSD/HDD Firmware all up to date.\n* GPU drivers up to date.\n* I tried removing all USB devices, leaving a basic keyboard and mouse, no change.\n* On the odd BSOD message I picked up, the fixes usually state for SFC/DISM commands to fix.\n* Running 'SFC /Scannow' would result in an error, which it then states it has fixed, after a reboot no change to issues. This scan also on occasion states all ok.\n* Running 'Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth' brings up  - \"Error: 0x800f0915The repair content could not be found anywhere.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI have been having issues for the last few weeks that have me pulling my hair out. Whenever I start my PC up, I will get an error code that causes a restart. This will repeat with a different error each time. Eventually, after like 3 or 4 cycles of this, I'll finally be able to get in, and then everything seems to work just fine. It usually crashes right as I'm signing into Windows, but sometimes it'll just freeze, and I'll have to do a hard shutoff. Once it starts up, there are usually no issues, but very rarely it will let me in but still crash within the first 30 second of using it. It consistently takes multiple attempts and never starts up without an error on the first attempt. \n\nThis started happening after I changed my CPU from an i7-12700k to an i5-14600k, but I don't recall it happening for the first week or two. I have reset Windows (the option that keeps my files). Windows is fully updated, the BIOS is updated, and I have tried to update all drivers I can think of. MemTest86 didn't detect any issues, and neither did Prime95. None of the various troubleshooters have detected anything, either. \n\nI have uploaded the minidumps I've collected in the last week below. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!\n\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/26xf6udpftl9nve/Minidump.zip/file",

    "selftext": "To preface, I have a 3080 FTW Ultra that I got in early 2021 powered by a SF750 SFX.\n\nSo I had been running FanControl for a while to run a fan profile on my case fans / GPU, but I guess a recent update had knocked out its ability to read sensor data correctly. Last Thursday while playing BF6 for idk an hour or so, one match I went to load into and my screen went blank but discord etc remained working. I tried win+shift+ctrl+b to reset the driver and it did nothing, so I had to hard restart the computer. When it rebooted, there was a windows update (of course) and then I noticed there was an nvidia driver update dated Oct 14 that was available so I downloaded it, and resumed gaming.\n\nThe next day, while playing some BF6 again I could hear my fans running like crazy, opened up fancontrol and saw the notification indicating the sensor reading issue and that it needed an update to allow it to properly read sensor data - fancontrol said my GPU was at like idk 45C but HWinfo had it at 88C, the hotspot was around 100C, I have no clue what it was while running BF6 since I had quit the game immediately when I heard the fans. Updated fan control, redid my fan curves and then launched BF6 again and it was fine. I played Valorant a bit later and was fine. In hindsight I have no clue what temps were when i initially had the first black screen, I‚Äôm unsure if the computer would have just shut off to prevent it from melting entirely or crashing the display driver and stop working would be the way it would handle overheating.\n\nSaturday I had gamed for a lil with zero issues, but then yesterday evening, I launched BF6, sat in the menu and then upon joining a game, black screen. I launched OCCT to try and stress test, black screen again. Mind you the rest of the computer appears to work, just no video output. Restarted, opened MSI afterburner and tried UV a tiny bit (used to have a nice UV for a long while but the profile got deleted on an update maybe sometime in August, didn‚Äôt really worry about redoing it and dialing it in again. Reduced power limit to 90% to see if maybe it was a PSU issue, ran a power test and it was fine, ran the VGA test and it threw an error but I didn‚Äôt get a black screen so I assumed the UV was maybe a tad unstable or something. Launched valorant while my friends were playing, sat in the menu, went to the range and did several rounds and when they were ready I joined their group and the moment it found a match and went to switch screens, black screen again‚Ä¶\n\nSo I took the GPU out, I have no clue what I‚Äôm looking at/for, but I noticed my thermal pads I‚Äôm assuming on my VRMs had melted sometime before last night, I‚Äôd only assume it could have been last Thursday but I‚Äôve had this card for several years (normally under load it would be ~60C or less).\n\nIm assuming thermal pads don‚Äôt melt unless it sustains some bad temps.  Am I cooked, would replacing the thermal pads and putting paste on the GPU even be worth it?  Here is a [a photo of the VRMS and board](https://postimg.cc/HJPsM8hv). I‚Äôm nervous that repeated issues could be causing power spikes / instability and potentially damage my PSU as well.\n\nAnyone out there who could maybe help?",

    "selftext": "First of all i write this with the help of ChapGTP cause english its not my main  language  \n\n\nHello everyone, I'm facing a very strange and frustrating issue with a new SSD, and I could really use some expert advice.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nI bought a **Samsung 990 Evo Plus 2TB** M.2 SSD during the recent Amazon sales. I installed it in the **M2\\_2 slot** of my **MSI B650 Gaming Plus WiFi** motherboard.\n\nInitially, it works fine. I can format it and install games. However, as soon as the drive is put under **any significant load** (e.g., running a game installed on it for 2-3 hours, or attempting a performance test in Samsung Magician), the drive completely crashes.\n\n**The Symptoms:**\n\n1. The drive suddenly appears as **RAW** in Windows Disk Management.\n2. I cannot format the drive, delete the volume, or interact with it at all.\n3. It disappears from utilities like CrystalDiskInfo, but often still shows up in Samsung Magician.\n\n**The Bizarre \"Fix\":**\n\nThe strange part is that **a simple PC restart completely resolves the issue.** After a reboot, the drive reappears, is properly formatted (NTFS), and is fully accessible again, as if nothing happened. I can then reinstall files, only for the issue to repeat under load.\n\n  \n**What I've Done So Far:**\n\n1. **RMA/Replacement:** I initially thought the SSD was faulty, so I RMA'd it with Amazon and received a brand new replacement. **The new drive has the exact same problem.**\n2. **Slot:** The SSD is currently in the **M2\\_2 slot**. The **M2\\_1 slot** is occupied by my boot drive (another M.2 SSD, which works perfectly).\n\n**My Hypothesis & Next Steps:**\n\n* It doesn't seem to be the SSD itself since the replacement failed identically.\n* I suspect the **M2\\_2 slot** on the motherboard might be defective or improperly supplying power/data under continuous load, but the fact that a simple restart \"fixes\" it temporarily is confusing. If the port were broken, I'd expect it to not show up at all.\n* I have purchased a **PCIe M.2 adapter** to test the drive in a standard PCIe slot.\n\nHas anyone with a B650 board experienced similar issues with the secondary M.2 slots? Could this be a **power delivery issue**, a **chipset/driver bug**, or something specific to the **M2\\_2 slot** on this motherboard model?\n\nAny advice on diagnostics or potential BIOS settings to check would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!  \n\n\n\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "TL;DR I just need a controller for CBM2299.\n\nHey guys, I just bought this usb stick about a week ago and I realized it was on ExFat format so I started to format it to NTFS format, it was kinda taking too long bc i had 10gb info in it and it was 3am so i left my pc open and went to bed. When i checked it in the morning there was a warning saying \"Windows was unable to complete the format\" (or something like that idk) and it wanted me to start the format again so i did. After 1-2 hours, the progress bar was still on 0% so i plugged off the usb (and i probably killed it by doing that). When i plugged it back it was dead and wanted me to insert a disc for D:. I did some researchs and i think its firmware is dead but the usb is alive so have to find and install its firmware again. I found out that it's controller is ChipsBank with CBM2299 number. I checked usbdev.ru and flashboot.ru but the latest program is for CBM2199. I found a controller for CBM2299 but it's in a chinese website and i need a QQ or WeChat account to download it and I'm not even sure if it's safe or not (LMK if you want the link). So basically I need a controller for CBM2299. Can anyone help me find it PLEASE?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI‚Äôve been troubleshooting my HP Omen 17-cb0040nr (2019, i7-9750H + RTX 2070 + 144 Hz G-Sync panel) for years, and it‚Äôs finally reaching a weird, half-alive state. Here‚Äôs the full story in chronological order.\n\nüïê 2019 ‚Äì Early 2020\n\nLaptop worked great for the first ~6 months.\n\nHeavy gaming (Apex Legends, etc.) pushed GPU temps to 80‚Äì85 ¬∞C.\n\nThe display would suddenly go black, sound would freeze, and I had to force shutdown.\n\nAfter cooling down, it would boot normally again.\n\nLag when plugged in: Occasionally, since purchase, performance would drop badly until I unplugged and re-plugged the charger, then FPS would instantly recover.\n\nüßπ Mid 2020 ‚Äì 2021\n\nFound dust clogging the cooling system; cleaned it thoroughly.\n\nTemps improved and random shutdowns reduced.\n\nAround 2021, HP UEFI Diagnostics flagged a ‚ÄúVideo Memory [F] failure‚Äù ‚Üí confirmed early VRAM instability on the GPU.\n\nFrom this point onward, the GPU remained functional but unstable under high load.\n\n‚ö° 2022 ‚Äì 2024\n\nContinued gaming on medium settings; GPU stayed below 78 ¬∞C.\n\nOccasional driver crashes or screen flickers.\n\nNo major shutdowns, but instability kept creeping back.\n\nüîã 2025\n\nHP Smart reported a ‚Äúblown charge-state fuse‚Äù ‚Äî battery stopped charging completely. Removed the battery since this. I get CMOS error and I press enter to see boot (hp omen logo).\n\nBegan using the laptop plugged in only, like a desktop.\n\nThe power button started blinking continuously even during normal operation ‚Üí likely due to the battery-circuit fault.\n\nSystem still booted and worked fine on AC.\n\nüí• Current State (2025 October)\n\nThe internal laptop display stays black most of the time (backlight faintly glows).\n\nExternal 200 Hz monitor (HDMI) works well ‚Äî I can even play Apex Legends for hours on medium settings with GPU VRAM capped to 4 GB.\n\n\nNVIDIA Control Panel won‚Äôt open, though the RTX 2070 is visible in Device Manager and Task Manager.\n\nBoot behavior:\n\nExternal monitor connected via HDMI.\n\nPress power ‚Üí CMOS error occurs(sometimes it wont be displayed in either of the displays, occurs when I start the laptop after a long time, like half a day etc) (I press enter to proceed with booting, as one can see if windows is booted or not by pressing caps lock to see if the button lights are working or not) \n\nWhat happens next in a successful boot is, the powee button light goes off and turns on in like 2 sec, I press entee agan and the same cycle happens for one more time (2 to 3 timez at max), and then the external display connected (sometimes internal display too) gets hp omen logo boot screen. Post this, if windows login acreen comes, in atleast one of the displays, it is a successful boot. Else, I have to force shutdown the pc and start again\n\nSystem reboots itself once or twice.\n\nHP Omen logo appears ‚Äî almost always on the external monitor.\n\nDisplay outcomes (approx. 10 boots):\n\n5 times ‚Üí only external monitor shows the Windows login screen, laptop panel stays blank.\n\n1 time ‚Üí both monitors work correctly and internal 144 Hz panel shows Windows login.\n\n4 times ‚Üí internal panel = black, external = HP logo only (no Windows output). I can still log in blindly and shut down via Alt + F4, so the system is running headless.\n\nWhen I try to ‚ÄúDuplicate display,‚Äù both displays drop to 1024√ó768 @ 60 Hz, the only modes Windows detects for the laptop screen.\n\nüîé Current Symptoms Summary\n\nGPU and HDMI output work reliably; internal panel almost dead.\n\nCMOS error on every cold boot ‚Üí BIOS resets device detection.\n\nHP Diagnostics previously confirmed Video Memory failure.\n\nüí≠ My Suspicions\n\nPartial GPU VRAM degradation or faulty eDP (output to internal panel).\n\nPossible loose or damaged eDP cable/panel connector.\n\nWeak CMOS battery causing repeated re-detection and boot loops.\n\nBattery-charging fuse blown (confirmed), forcing AC-only operation.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è What Still Works\n\nExternal monitor gaming at 200 Hz for hours.\n\nAll USB, audio, and Ethernet functions.\n\nInternal panel sometimes returns to life for one boot, then fails again.\n\n‚ùìLooking for Advice\n\nHas anyone seen an RTX-series GPU that works fine externally but fails internally?\n\nCould a failing VRAM or eDP transmitter cause intermittent CMOS errors?\n\nIs a GPU reball worth it on this board (L50873-006), or should I hunt for a replacement motherboard?\n\nAny way to disable the internal panel entirely to speed up boot?\n\nAny insights or similar experiences would really help.\nThanks for reading ‚Äî posting this so future Omen owners facing half-dead GPUs can find a full timeline too.",

Files, videos and images all with a bunch of metadata like tags.\n\nAnyway, did all that. And now whenever I search my indexed folder with images my CPU usage explodes. And I've used this PC to search before I did all this, and it did not do this when searching. My CPU is also only a year old and I'd say decent. So it should not be struggling this much.\n\nAnd yet when I look at my task manager I see that explorer.exe is using 62% of my CPU in one instance and 33% in another. Worse, even when I stop the search and close all explorer windows it still stays at this ridiculous amount.\n\nOnly when I right click the process in task manager and \"Restart\" that it clears and things are back to normal (currently 3% total CPU usage).\n\nAnyone have any idea what's going on here?",

    "selftext": "1. The problem\n2. What I've tried to diagnose/fix\n3. Hardware\n\nI don't have access to other hardware to swap in to test, so if it's a case of buying a new component I'd want to be at least _relatively_ sure it's the culprit before buying one, in case it just changes nothing.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nAs per the title - for ~5 weeks now, my PC has been periodically crashing (usually during (light) gaming) maybe a couple of times a day on average. The first time it did it I was playing Minecraft on one screen and watching a film on another. Both screens went black, then the 2nd monitor came back on with the film frozen. After a couple of minutes both screens went black, then I heard the Windows boot sound but the screens still said no signal. I held the power button down to restart, my main monitor came back but it froze on the POST screen (logo and spinning loading circle, which froze). That happened a couple of times before I got into the BIOS, then Windows offered me startup repair which failed, then a restore which worked.\n\nSince then it hasn't failed to boot like that. The crash/freeze/restart behaviour isn't 100% consistent but falls generally into one of these categories:\n\n1. The screens go black and say no signal. If I'm playing/watching something I can still hear it for a bit. Takes a power-button restart to restart.\n2. The screens go off, then back on (sometimes a couple times) before freezing with one on. Needs to be hard-restarted\n3. The screens go off. After a few seconds, the PC restarts itself\n4. (Only happened ~3 times) the screens blink off then on, frozen, and my GPU fans ramp up to max. Needs a hard-restart\n\nThere's almost always nothing noteworthy in Event Viewer, except one time there was [this WHEA-Logger error](https://pastebin.com/dYX85Pjw). I also have [a log saved from Reliability Monitor](https://pastebin.com/3B8k7tKT).\n\nAs I said above, it's only ever light gaming; Minecraft, some indie/2D games etc.\n\n**Diagnosis/Fix Attempts**\n\n1. DDU and complete driver reinstallation\n2. ~15-minute Furmark GPU stress test\n3. 20-minute OCCT tests on GPU, VRAM, memory, CPU & Storage - no errors reported on any of them (though one time I started a GPU variable load stress test, stopped it after 20 seconds, then when I clicked in OCCT to set up a steady load GPU test it crashed; i.e. when no games were running)\n4. 90% underclock and power limit in MSI Afterburner\n\n**Hardware**\n\n\n\nComponent | Model | Notes\n---|---|----\nCPU | Ryzen 7 5700X3D | Bought from AliExpress, but from a reputable seller on Reddit's advice\nMotherboard| Gigbabyte B550 Aorus Elite V2 | \nRAM | 2 x 16gb Corsair Vengeance LPX 3600 | \nGPU | 980 ti | 2nd hand from a friend 2/3 years ago\nPSU | OCZ ZT 650W | Huh... (see below)\n\nI thought I had a ~1-year-old 850W in the machine, but I guess my ex took that with her PC when she left. So this is my old PSU from maybe 2014? Oops, I'd kinda discounted it possibly being a PSU issue because I didn't realise it wasn't the newer one.",

    "selftext": "My mom is driving me crazy because she is constantly getting logged out from her e-banking site, sometimes after seconds, sometimes after a few minutes. According to her bank, auto-logout should only happen after 10 minutes of inactivity. \n\nShe has tried Firefox, Chrome and even using a private window but it keeps happening with all of them. The bank just tells her to delete cookies/cache and make sure everything is updated but Win 11 and all browsers are up-to-date.\n\nApparently her sister, who uses the same bank, doesn't have that issue. \n\nI can't really see how something on her computer could possibly cause this behavior.\n\nAny ideas what could be causing this? Or anything I could check to diagnose or narrow down the problem?",

It was a clean install (new SSD).\n\nGenerally everything has been fine until about a month ago, I started noticing in the morning that the computer appeared to have restarted itself (on occasion I would see it was a failed windows update, but not always) during the night. I would check task manager and see the system had been up for a few hours.  \nI have been trying to investigate the issues but having real bother trying to figure it out.\n\nEssentially the system is getting worse and worse, Firefox constantly crashes tabs and/or the whole program. System Tray programs crash. Regular BSODs. Games will crash. Just generally unstable.\n\nBelow I will try set out what I have found out and actions\n\n* According to the reliability monitor under \"Critical Events\" about the first crash \"Description The previous system shutdown at **12:47:44 on ‚Äé20/‚Äé09/‚Äé2025** was unexpected\" This report is dated **1311 20/09/2025**\n* The monitor then has under \"Warnings\" - \"Problem: Failed Windows Update  Description: Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x800F0991: 2025-09 Cumulative Update for Windows 11 Version 24H2 for x64-based Systems (KB5065426) (26100.6584).\" This is dated **1303 20/09/2025.**\n* There are similar issues on the same day with another crash.\n* Subsequent days show further issues which then start to cause crashes in other software including system tray items and active windows.\n* As mentioned, there is multiple error messages coming up, I don't think I can list them all as its always changing.\n* I have spent about an hour in safe mode whilst doing this post and no crashes.\n\nI have now been trying all sorts-\n\n* I updated the M2 Drive firmware, this was a hassle as the Sandisk software refused to open, but worked around this by running in Win Safe Mode, possibly software not working due to instability (some googling suggests GPU can cause issues opening).\n* All MOBO drivers should also now be uptodate.\n* SSD/HDD Firmware all up to date.\n* GPU drivers up to date.\n* I tried removing all USB devices, leaving a basic keyboard and mouse, no change.\n* On the odd BSOD message I picked up, the fixes usually state for SFC/DISM commands to fix.\n* Running 'SFC /Scannow' would result in an error, which it then states it has fixed, after a reboot no change to issues. This scan also on occasion states all ok.\n* Running 'Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth' brings up  - \"Error: 0x800f0915The repair content could not be found anywhere.

Can provide further information as needed.  \nCheers\n\nEdit - Dump files - [https://www.mediafire.com/file/j29fwiz6g29i3i0/DumpFiles.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/j29fwiz6g29i3i0/DumpFiles.zip/file)",

My account activity page also shows chrome logins when I only use mobile or Firefox.\n\nHere's the deal though, I have 2fa and wasnt locked out of my account. Whoever it was was only interested on subbing and upvote sensually explicit material (along with some techbro stuff. And one mushroom subreddit upvote. . .).\n\nI've scanned my computer and phone with my usual anti-virus as well as Malwarebytes. No one has access to my phone or computer and both have long passwords for workcompromised? Also have Proton VPN on both my phone and computer with Net Shield on max setting.\n\nSo I ask: how on earth was i compromised?! I really want to prevent this in the future\n\nIf this isnt the best place for advice of this nature, please let me know.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI have been having issues for the last few weeks that have me pulling my hair out. Whenever I start my PC up, I will get an error code that causes a restart. This will repeat with a different error each time. Eventually, after like 3 or 4 cycles of this, I'll finally be able to get in, and then everything seems to work just fine. It usually crashes right as I'm signing into Windows, but sometimes it'll just freeze, and I'll have to do a hard shutoff. Once it starts up, there are usually no issues, but very rarely it will let me in but still crash within the first 30 second of using it. It consistently takes multiple attempts and never starts up without an error on the first attempt. \n\nThis started happening after I changed my CPU from an i7-12700k to an i5-14600k, but I don't recall it happening for the first week or two. I have reset Windows (the option that keeps my files). Windows is fully updated, the BIOS is updated, and I have tried to update all drivers I can think of. MemTest86 didn't detect any issues, and neither did Prime95. None of the various troubleshooters have detected anything, either. \n\nI have uploaded the minidumps I've collected in the last week below. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!\n\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/26xf6udpftl9nve/Minidump.zip/file",
