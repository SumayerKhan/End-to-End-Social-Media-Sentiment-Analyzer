    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "title": "I created yet another Pomodoro timer, but this one was inspired by Lo-Fi girl",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI’d like to share the app I’ve been working on over the past few months - **Dory**.\n\nI think the video does a much better job of explaining what it’s all about, so feel free to check it out here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z\\_Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z_Q)\n\n**Dory is an app switcher that lets you quickly cycle through apps without moving your hand from the mouse, keyboard or trackpad - and without needing to remember any shortcuts.**\n\nClick a mouse button - or a modifier key if both hands are on the keyboard - and type the first letter of the app’s name.\n\nFind apps using the first letter, middle letters, acronyms, or similar names.\n\nIf multiple apps share that letter, just keep tapping it to cycle through them.\n\nYou can also press the middle mouse button and start typing the app’s name directly.\n\nPrefer tapping over holding? No problem. With Press Mode, you can open Dory’s sleek UI using a global shortcut or a **trackpad gesture!** (new)\n\nDory works right out of the box - and over time, it learns which apps you use most and prioritizes them.\n\nNo extra shortcuts.\n\nNo setup. Nothing to remember.\n\n\\--\n\nIt's currently $4.99 on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dory-app-switcher/id6746273626?mt=12) (**One-time purchase**. **No subscription.**) for a limited time.",

If I switch my phone to English it all works.\n\nIt’s just such a slap in the face not getting ANYTHING of what was promised. And you can’t say ”Soon” for over a year…\n\nJesus… I’ve used Apple products since -94, I just want what was promised.",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "title": "Added height ruler to my iOS photogrammetry app",
    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "title": "iPhone 16e glitch with certain apps",
    "selftext": "I got an iPhone 16e about a month ago and have noticed that randomly I cannot use or tap buttons within some of my apps but I am still able to do other functions within these apps like swiping, tap & holding, or pulling down my control center and notification center (and swiping up to go home). This has been happening in Google Maps, Snapchat, and Uber Eats (those are really the only 3 apps I actually use). \n\nIn snapchat if I’m in a chat, and I tap on the grey area of a chat/snap to unsave it in chat (vice versa) nothing happens, but I’m still able to tap & hold that same chat/snap until the options menu pops up and I can select “unsave in chat” (vice versa).\n\nIn Uber Eats Driver App when I’m delivering an order and I tap the take photo button or the confirm delivery button, nothing happens and since those are the only ways to complete those functions I have to close the Uber App out and reopen it. This gets risky because Uber requires their app to stay open for it to function properly and sometimes if you close the app put during a delivery the delivery will be gone when you reopen, so image you drive 10miles and spend the last 40minutes waiting at the restaurant, and picking up the food just to find out you can’t even get paid for that order because your brand new $600 (yes I’m aware $600 is considered poor in the Apple universe) Apple smart phone can’t preform basic functions. Assuming the glitch remedy doesn’t make your order disappear, this remedy only fixes the issue once, meaning if I close out and reopen Uber, then complete the delivery, then the issue will just reappear on the next delivery.\n\nWith Google Maps I haven’t had issues with tapping buttons but I noticed when I put an address in and follow the google directions, it will show my arrow icon moving along the blue line but instead of the blue line turning grey behind me as I continue forward, it all stays blue (as if I haven’t driven down that road yet). This seems like a small issue but it causes google to think I haven’t moved event though I can see my arrow icon moving so if I have a left turn in 2.2 miles and I’ve already driven 1.7 miles google still displays 2.2miles until my left turn and it also doesn’t update my remaining time until arrive. Another thing google normally does that’s pretty important (that doesn’t work now because of my phone) is zooming in and out based on your speed and how close your turn is. If I’m going 55miles an hour and have a left turn coming up, I cannot see that if google is zoomed all the way into my icon thinking I’m not moving (Imagine seeing every building/landmark on google maps fly by you almost instantly because you aren’t zoomed out enough to see what’s coming ahead of you). I can see see the name of the road coming up and I can look for road signs, but I live in a somewhat rural area and a lot of roads have no street lights, thick treelines close to the road, and side roads that are so narrow they look like driveways, so there are many times where I end up having to make a 3-point turn because my turn snuck up on me.\n\nHas anyone else experienced issues like these? Has Apple acknowledged any similar glitches with their iPhone 16e or 16 line up?",

Got everything checked (had a very long checklist actually), pretty much certain that it’s retail not fake Iphone and all the functionality is ok, it’s in perfect condition. Also it have arrived factory reseted, but already skipped that stating Hello menu with all setup settings if that makes sense (sorry for my English, not my native language). And again, it is absolutely ok, no lags at all and so on. \n\nBut when I have reset it again to factory settings cause I wanted to gift it with that starting menu still present on first launch, I have noticed that the swipe on Hello screen is kinda laggy, it feels kinda 60 Hz idk, though after it in further language and country settings it feels again very flawless and like 120 Hz. And after all of the starting setting there is again no problems at all. I tried to restart it, but it all still the same thing. And also what is interesting, after the restart it immediately shows the language settings and only after I press power button to lock and unlock it it shows that apple logo thing (not the white apple on black screen when booting, but that animated apple logo which transforms to “Hello”)\n\nSo I’m a bit confused with that, I don’t think it might be a fake Iphone or something, but still wanted to be sure if it’s normal?\nMaybe someone have experienced the same thing?

I’m worried if I turn on lock camera it’ll be lower quality when I zoom in, and I just don’t know what lock white balance really is. \n\nAnother question I had, what’s the max zoom I should use? I thought 17 pro max had 8x optical zoom but apparently it’s 5x and then 8x optical-like quality? Should I not go past 5x to have the highest quality possible? Do I lower exposure and should I AE/AF lock?

However, for some arbitrary reason, turning this setting on doesn't let you dismiss the call by double pressing the power button and there is NO WAY to dismiss a call without this.\n\nSo I either sacrifice\n1. Not being able to dismiss a call and let it ring till it gets dismissed automatically (like the first ever telephone)\n2. Keep the screen on for the whole duration of call\n\nIs it a known thing? Or is my iPhone (or me) tripping? ",

I don’t have a picture because he threw it away and it is a bit hard to describe but if you looked at it from a distance it looked like there was no cover at all. I’ve been searching for a few days and I can’t find anything.( please don’t recommend no case/ clear case) If anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",

Additionally, messaging from the computer sometimes switches the conversation back to my personal (primary) number. \n\nIs there a third party app that I can use as a dedicated messaging app for my second number - effectively reserving the messages app for my primary number and the third party app for the secondary number? I've used Open Phone in the past and had issues with their texting platform.\n\nAppreciate your suggestions!",

I’ve had this problem for 5+ years now, typically coming and going for months at a time depending in the iOS version and phone version. \n\nIt happens in various ways, eg. the alarm popping on the screen but not making any sound, or the alarm completely not happening at all and showing “off” in the Clock app despite 100% being on before the alarm time, or the alarm not happening at all and still showing “on” in the Clock app. \n\nThis happened to me very frequently in 2022, and started happening again after updating to iOS 17. Even more frequently now that I have an iPhone 17, approximately 20% of the time I would say. \n\nDoes anyone know what causes this? I’ve tried fixing all the Face ID settings, Attention settings, Focus settings, Sleep mode settings, Clock sound and silent vs. non-silent, redownloading the Clock app, multiple alarms. Nothing fixes it. I can set alarms at 7:00am, 7:10am, 7:20am then wake up at 8:00am on accident to see that *all of my alarms are still set to “on”, despite never going off!*\n\nI can’t believe this is still an issue, and I know I’m not alone too.

    "selftext": "For years, I have been using an iPod touch for MP3 music, though I use a Pixel and Android Auto for my streaming. My ipod started misbehaving recently, and I discovered that the battery was swollen, and the device seems to have finally reached its end of life. So I decided to buy a refurb iPhone SE 3 to replace it...\n\nI got the device, updated it to iOS 26, loaded my music, and now I find that I absolutely cannot figure out how to get it to play music over USB in my Honda Civic without unlocking it each time which I do not want to do as it should remain tucked away in my car.\n\nGoogle has been unhelpful as the info seems outdated. Can anyone help me figure out how to fix this issue? I'm open to all options as long as I can continue to use Android Auto, load new music on the device, and not need to unlock it to use it in the car as it will only play music and serve no other purpose.\n\nAny help is appreciated, thanks.",

Keen to go for a clean minimalist and sleek look.\n\nI’ve been looking at Reddit and website forums all morning and been trying to figure out what’s the best leather case. Wanted a blue case or something that goes well with the deep blue.\n\nAndar Aspen and Nomad Burgandy are the top contenders, with Decoded third due to price!\n\nRyan London is also a contender (no blue version though) and whilst Bullstrap looks good, read they’re not as ethical or legit as they market themselves (something about using cheap Chinese labour and overpriced cases).\n\nLooked at Loneli editions but there wasn’t a blue version on UK Amazon and Mujjo didn’t have any pro max cases on Amazon UK. Vaja cases seemed too expensive.\n\nAnyways, what do you think looks or is better from the above? Does the Burgandy go with the deep blue for anyone who has it?\n\nAny other suggestions?\n\nTLDR: what would you recommend between the Andar Aspen Navy case and the Nomad Modern Burgandy case for a Deep Blue 17 Pro Max phone? Does the Burgandy work? Is worth going for the Decoded case instead?",

    "selftext": "I got iPhone 16 Plus this year in July and have used Samsung S series, Note series since years\n\nUsually the iPhones last longer but what are some usage patterns which affect it because my relative has iPhone 12 and it is lagging so much inspite of using for around 3 years only\n\nI currently know and follow these patterns:\n1. Background App Refresh off, not needed for me\n2. Not closing recent apps\n3. Only needed and useful apps installed \n4. Pretty simple home and lock screen, no widgets needed except Calendar and Reminder on home screen \n\nI do gaming sometimes but iPhone doesn’t become so hot because of medium graphics settings\n\nAny changes in above or other suggestions?",

    "selftext": "So I posted not long ago about screen issues with 17 series. I had a 16 pro max which I promised my mother and it had a GVC screen. So I gave it up and got a 17 pro max. It had a GH3 screen with pink hue to the right no matter what. I returned it and tried an air. This had a G9P which was more yellowish at the top of the display with True Tone and night shift on. Got rid again and thought im done here just going to get the cheapest base 17. Got the 17 like the phone but it as exactly the same issue as the air. It has G9Q display. If I turn it all off the display for the most part is fine and liveable. However I’m still getting used to the blue hue it gives off with those settings disabled. My question to you guys is, would you keep going and going until you get a decent phone or would you save your mental health and just “cope” with what you have. I have around 5 days to get rid of it but I’m just scared it’s same again plus I would have to step up to a pro probably as 17 base are as rare as rocking horse poop at the moment. ",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

I’ve seen folks still using the iPhone X or even older ones that work perfectly fine while others can’t resist upgrading every single year.\nHonestly, I feel like iPhones can easily last 4 to 6 years if you take good care of them. The hardware holds up and Apple keeps pushing updates for quite a while. But it also makes me think should Apple stop selling older Pro models sooner or is it better that they keep them around for people who don’t want to spend a fortune on the latest one?\n\nSo, how old is your iPhone, and how is it holding up these days?",

    "title": "iPhone 16e glitch with certain apps",
    "selftext": "I got an iPhone 16e about a month ago and have noticed that randomly I cannot use or tap buttons within some of my apps but I am still able to do other functions within these apps like swiping, tap & holding, or pulling down my control center and notification center (and swiping up to go home). This has been happening in Google Maps, Snapchat, and Uber Eats (those are really the only 3 apps I actually use). \n\nIn snapchat if I’m in a chat, and I tap on the grey area of a chat/snap to unsave it in chat (vice versa) nothing happens, but I’m still able to tap & hold that same chat/snap until the options menu pops up and I can select “unsave in chat” (vice versa).\n\nIn Uber Eats Driver App when I’m delivering an order and I tap the take photo button or the confirm delivery button, nothing happens and since those are the only ways to complete those functions I have to close the Uber App out and reopen it. This gets risky because Uber requires their app to stay open for it to function properly and sometimes if you close the app put during a delivery the delivery will be gone when you reopen, so image you drive 10miles and spend the last 40minutes waiting at the restaurant, and picking up the food just to find out you can’t even get paid for that order because your brand new $600 (yes I’m aware $600 is considered poor in the Apple universe) Apple smart phone can’t preform basic functions. Assuming the glitch remedy doesn’t make your order disappear, this remedy only fixes the issue once, meaning if I close out and reopen Uber, then complete the delivery, then the issue will just reappear on the next delivery.\n\nWith Google Maps I haven’t had issues with tapping buttons but I noticed when I put an address in and follow the google directions, it will show my arrow icon moving along the blue line but instead of the blue line turning grey behind me as I continue forward, it all stays blue (as if I haven’t driven down that road yet). This seems like a small issue but it causes google to think I haven’t moved event though I can see my arrow icon moving so if I have a left turn in 2.2 miles and I’ve already driven 1.7 miles google still displays 2.2miles until my left turn and it also doesn’t update my remaining time until arrive. Another thing google normally does that’s pretty important (that doesn’t work now because of my phone) is zooming in and out based on your speed and how close your turn is. If I’m going 55miles an hour and have a left turn coming up, I cannot see that if google is zoomed all the way into my icon thinking I’m not moving (Imagine seeing every building/landmark on google maps fly by you almost instantly because you aren’t zoomed out enough to see what’s coming ahead of you). I can see see the name of the road coming up and I can look for road signs, but I live in a somewhat rural area and a lot of roads have no street lights, thick treelines close to the road, and side roads that are so narrow they look like driveways, so there are many times where I end up having to make a 3-point turn because my turn snuck up on me.\n\nHas anyone else experienced issues like these? Has Apple acknowledged any similar glitches with their iPhone 16e or 16 line up?",

Got everything checked (had a very long checklist actually), pretty much certain that it’s retail not fake Iphone and all the functionality is ok, it’s in perfect condition. Also it have arrived factory reseted, but already skipped that stating Hello menu with all setup settings if that makes sense (sorry for my English, not my native language). And again, it is absolutely ok, no lags at all and so on. \n\nBut when I have reset it again to factory settings cause I wanted to gift it with that starting menu still present on first launch, I have noticed that the swipe on Hello screen is kinda laggy, it feels kinda 60 Hz idk, though after it in further language and country settings it feels again very flawless and like 120 Hz. And after all of the starting setting there is again no problems at all. I tried to restart it, but it all still the same thing. And also what is interesting, after the restart it immediately shows the language settings and only after I press power button to lock and unlock it it shows that apple logo thing (not the white apple on black screen when booting, but that animated apple logo which transforms to “Hello”)\n\nSo I’m a bit confused with that, I don’t think it might be a fake Iphone or something, but still wanted to be sure if it’s normal?\nMaybe someone have experienced the same thing? Or might it be related to IOS 26? ",

I’m worried if I turn on lock camera it’ll be lower quality when I zoom in, and I just don’t know what lock white balance really is. \n\nAnother question I had, what’s the max zoom I should use? I thought 17 pro max had 8x optical zoom but apparently it’s 5x and then 8x optical-like quality? Should I not go past 5x to have the highest quality possible? Do I lower exposure and should I AE/AF lock?

    "selftext": "(I am a first time iPhone user so please pardon me if I am asking something stupid)\n\nI wasn't able to dismiss a call by double pressing the power button. So I found out that it is because I have \"Prevent lock to end call\" turned on.\n\nNow, I DO want this setting on. I mostly take calls using headphones and sometimes these calls are long. So it makes sense that I don’t want my screen to be on a 2 hour long call, right? However, for some arbitrary reason, turning this setting on doesn't let you dismiss the call by double pressing the power button and there is NO WAY to dismiss a call without this.\n\nSo I either sacrifice\n1. Not being able to dismiss a call and let it ring till it gets dismissed automatically (like the first ever telephone)\n2. Keep the screen on for the whole duration of call\n\nIs it a known thing? Or is my iPhone (or me) tripping? ",

Additionally, messaging from the computer sometimes switches the conversation back to my personal (primary) number. \n\nIs there a third party app that I can use as a dedicated messaging app for my second number - effectively reserving the messages app for my primary number and the third party app for the secondary number?

I’ve had this problem for 5+ years now, typically coming and going for months at a time depending in the iOS version and phone version. \n\nIt happens in various ways, eg. the alarm popping on the screen but not making any sound, or the alarm completely not happening at all and showing “off” in the Clock app despite 100% being on before the alarm time, or the alarm not happening at all and still showing “on” in the Clock app. \n\nThis happened to me very frequently in 2022, and started happening again after updating to iOS 17. Even more frequently now that I have an iPhone 17, approximately 20% of the time I would say. \n\nDoes anyone know what causes this? I’ve tried fixing all the Face ID settings, Attention settings, Focus settings, Sleep mode settings, Clock sound and silent vs. non-silent, redownloading the Clock app, multiple alarms. Nothing fixes it. I can set alarms at 7:00am, 7:10am, 7:20am then wake up at 8:00am on accident to see that *all of my alarms are still set to “on”, despite never going off!*\n\nI can’t believe this is still an issue, and I know I’m not alone too.

The hardware holds up and Apple keeps pushing updates for quite a while. But it also makes me think should Apple stop selling older Pro models sooner or is it better that they keep them around for people who don’t want to spend a fortune on the latest one?\n\nSo, how old is your iPhone, and how is it holding up these days?",

    "title": "iPhone 16e glitch with certain apps",
    "selftext": "I got an iPhone 16e about a month ago and have noticed that randomly I cannot use or tap buttons within some of my apps but I am still able to do other functions within these apps like swiping, tap & holding, or pulling down my control center and notification center (and swiping up to go home). This has been happening in Google Maps, Snapchat, and Uber Eats (those are really the only 3 apps I actually use). \n\nIn snapchat if I’m in a chat, and I tap on the grey area of a chat/snap to unsave it in chat (vice versa) nothing happens, but I’m still able to tap & hold that same chat/snap until the options menu pops up and I can select “unsave in chat” (vice versa).\n\nIn Uber Eats Driver App when I’m delivering an order and I tap the take photo button or the confirm delivery button, nothing happens and since those are the only ways to complete those functions I have to close the Uber App out and reopen it. This gets risky because Uber requires their app to stay open for it to function properly and sometimes if you close the app put during a delivery the delivery will be gone when you reopen, so image you drive 10miles and spend the last 40minutes waiting at the restaurant, and picking up the food just to find out you can’t even get paid for that order because your brand new $600 (yes I’m aware $600 is considered poor in the Apple universe) Apple smart phone can’t preform basic functions. Assuming the glitch remedy doesn’t make your order disappear, this remedy only fixes the issue once, meaning if I close out and reopen Uber, then complete the delivery, then the issue will just reappear on the next delivery.\n\nWith Google Maps I haven’t had issues with tapping buttons but I noticed when I put an address in and follow the google directions, it will show my arrow icon moving along the blue line but instead of the blue line turning grey behind me as I continue forward, it all stays blue (as if I haven’t driven down that road yet). This seems like a small issue but it causes google to think I haven’t moved event though I can see my arrow icon moving so if I have a left turn in 2.2 miles and I’ve already driven 1.7 miles google still displays 2.2miles until my left turn and it also doesn’t update my remaining time until arrive. Another thing google normally does that’s pretty important (that doesn’t work now because of my phone) is zooming in and out based on your speed and how close your turn is. If I’m going 55miles an hour and have a left turn coming up, I cannot see that if google is zoomed all the way into my icon thinking I’m not moving (Imagine seeing every building/landmark on google maps fly by you almost instantly because you aren’t zoomed out enough to see what’s coming ahead of you). I can see see the name of the road coming up and I can look for road signs, but I live in a somewhat rural area and a lot of roads have no street lights, thick treelines close to the road, and side roads that are so narrow they look like driveways, so there are many times where I end up having to make a 3-point turn because my turn snuck up on me.\n\nHas anyone else experienced issues like these? Has Apple acknowledged any similar glitches with their iPhone 16e or 16 line up?",

Got everything checked (had a very long checklist actually), pretty much certain that it’s retail not fake Iphone and all the functionality is ok, it’s in perfect condition. Also it have arrived factory reseted, but already skipped that stating Hello menu with all setup settings if that makes sense (sorry for my English, not my native language). And again, it is absolutely ok, no lags at all and so on. \n\nBut when I have reset it again to factory settings cause I wanted to gift it with that starting menu still present on first launch, I have noticed that the swipe on Hello screen is kinda laggy, it feels kinda 60 Hz idk, though after it in further language and country settings it feels again very flawless and like 120 Hz. And after all of the starting setting there is again no problems at all. I tried to restart it, but it all still the same thing. And also what is interesting, after the restart it immediately shows the language settings and only after I press power button to lock and unlock it it shows that apple logo thing (not the white apple on black screen when booting, but that animated apple logo which transforms to “Hello”)\n\nSo I’m a bit confused with that, I don’t think it might be a fake Iphone or something, but still wanted to be sure if it’s normal?\nMaybe someone have experienced the same thing? Or might it be related to IOS 26? ",

It’s a great feature, but it’s locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built **MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to **any Android phone running Android 9 or above** — including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt’s still in early access and I’d love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper) \n\nThis is just the beginning - I’m actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you’re into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I’d really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre’s report clearly mentioned “Display – step mark on display.”\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called “flagship quality” completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care — never dropped, always in Samsung’s original case and protector — yet the display failed twice. It’s shocking how a premium device costing nearly ₹1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite — big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you’re left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand’s promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI’m an indie Android developer, and over the past few months I’ve been working on something that brings back the old-school radio experience — but built for the modern Android ecosystem.\n\nThe app lets users:  \n📻 Listen to **50,000+ live radio stations** from around the world (music, news, talk, podcasts).  \n🌎 **Browse by Country, Genre, or Language** — for example, K-Pop from Korea or classic rock from the US.  \n🔎 **Global Search** — find any station by keyword, location, or genre.  \n❤️ **Favorite stations** to build your personal list.  \n😴 **Sleep Timer & Auto Start** — one of my favorite features for night listening.\n\nMy focus was on keeping it lightweight, responsive, and aligned with Android design principles — no clutter, just pure listening.\n\nI’d love to hear from **Android enthusiasts** about what makes a radio or music app *feel native* and enjoyable on Android.\n\n* Do you prefer Material-You dynamic theming?\n* Would background playback controls via notification or lock screen make a difference?\n* Any UI or UX preferences that make you stay longer in such apps?\n\n👉 For those curious, it’s available on the Play Store here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newradio.fmradio.radio.radiotuner.radiostation.freeradio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newradio.fmradio.radio.radiotuner.radiostation.freeradio)\n\nHappy to take feedback, discuss architecture, and chat about how I implemented global streaming efficiently for Android.\n\nThanks for reading — your suggestions can genuinely help me polish this for future updates 🙏",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course). I would LOVE if google would implement Android XR in Android. I dont mind my phone getting hot but I wouldn't have to sync my photos and all of that.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I’ve been working on something I’m really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It’s a great feature, but it’s locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built **MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to **any Android phone running Android 9 or above** — including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt’s still in early access and I’d love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper) \n\nThis is just the beginning - I’m actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you’re into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I’d really appreciate your input.",

But it costs 190€, so it is a budget phone.\n\n  \nHere is the press release: [AI device family is growing: Deutsche Telekom's AI-phone Pro is coming | Deutsche Telekom](https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/ai-phone-pro-is-coming-1097090)\n\nAnd of course their AI bullshit: [“Our” AI-phone brings „AI for everyone“ | Deutsche Telekom](https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/our-ai-phone-brings-ai-for-everyone-1095198)\n\n  \nLast but not least, I found the specsheet for the T Phone 3 Pro (290€ in GR): [https://www.telekom.com/resource/blob/1097094/be7b816cbdd1f40ab13fbf1698d9590b/dl-251006-product-information-ai-phone-pro-data.pdf](https://www.telekom.com/resource/blob/1097094/be7b816cbdd1f40ab13fbf1698d9590b/dl-251006-product-information-ai-phone-pro-data.pdf)\n\nAll the specs are very good, almost high-end, except for the Processor which is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 with four A78 (2.4GHz) and four A55 (1.8 GHz) cores.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey folks, hoping someone here has seen this before because I’m going crazy.\n\nMy sister has a Google Pixel (bought new earlier this year). She recently **forgot her screen lock code**, so we had to **factory reset** the phone through recovery mode. Ever since, it’s completely stuck at the **FRP screen** saying:\n\n>\n\nWe *are* signing in with that exact account — the same Gmail she’s always used on this phone. We’ve reset the password, logged in successfully on other devices, even removed the Pixel from “Your Devices” in her Google Account. Still, the phone refuses to accept it and keeps showing that FRP message.\n\nHere’s what we’ve already tried:\n\n* Waited over **three days** after resetting the password (to bypass the 72-hour FRP delay).\n* Removed the device from her Google account and waited again.\n* Double-checked that the email and password are correct (copy/paste).\n* Attempted account recovery just to verify ownership.\n\nWhen trying to recover the account via phone number, the recovery screen even shows a **completely different email** as being linked — which makes zero sense because this number was only added recently and has *never* been tied to another Google account.\n\nSo right now we have a phone that’s totally unusable even though we can log into the correct Google account everywhere else. It feels like the FRP system has just bugged out and won’t recognize the legit owner anymore.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Has anyone else seen FRP get stuck like this after a password reset?\n2. Is there *any* legit way to make Google refresh or re-sync ownership on their side?\n3. Would contacting Google Support with proof of purchase and IMEI actually help?\n4. Any other ideas before this thing becomes an expensive paperweight?\n\nWe don’t want to mess with shady bypass tools — just looking for a proper fix. Any help or firsthand experiences appreciated!",

Was excited for the AI features and the better spam blocking than my prior s24+ . \n\nI'm having some issues with it though and wondering if I got a bad phone, if these issues are common, and if there are fixes. They are more annoying than deal breakers so as of now I think I would still stick with the pixel 10 pro because of the benefits it has. It would be nice to resolve some of these though.\n\nIssues\n- YouTube sometimes slow . Shorts don't load . This is rare. \n- on screen buttons not registering my touch sometimes. Not sure if it is more sensitive to placement than my prior phone but I have noticed a handful of times in multiple apps that this is the case. YouTube, obsidian , chrome\n- content and sometimes buttons are only partly on the screen in some apps. Maybe this is typical on the smaller devices. The pixel 10 corners also seem more rounded than my s24+\n- obsidian note taking app closes despite me trying every optimization I can find to keep it open. \n- obsidian links do not render as links sometimes in edit mode. They do render if I turn to view mode. Just checked and obsidian on the s24+ doesn't have this issue. \n- swiping doesn't work as consistently. Reddit app, my open app drawer, ect. I have to swipe further across for it to fully switch to the next thing. Just tried on the s24+ end it doesn't have this issue despite being a bigger screen. ",

When it's closed or in the background it won't deliver so everything eventually comes through sms/mms.\n\nI wiped her phone which didn't fix it. Reverted back to Android 15 and that still didn't fix the RCS issue. So updated back to 16 and said to disable RCS so she can get texts on time.\n\nNow ever since she got the phone setup from the multiple wipes it will not get notifications at all for multiple apps the major ones for her being Snapchat, Facebook and Ring.\n\nThis is so infuriating.

A few days ago, it accidentally fell down and display was dead.As suggested by Google service I sent it via courier to the official Pixel service center in Noida.\n\nToday I got an update saying the phone has “liquid damage” and cannot be repaired, only replaced and the quote is 49k.\nThe frustrating part is, I bought the phone for 42k.So the replacement makes zero sense.\n\nAny trusted repair shops or technicians in Hyderabad who can handle Pixel 8 motherboard/display issues reliably (even unofficially)?\nOr should I just cut my losses and move on to another phone?\n\nWould really appreciate any suggestions, experiences, or service center recommendations 🙏\n\n",

I wanted the Google branded case, but the in store rep sold me on the Zagg.   \nAfter a day of using it (we were home by then) It's clear that the Zagg case is so very thick that I can't reliably swipe up or \"in\" (back) on the front screen.   \nI started a return with Google, and it got \"hung up\" in the \"waiting for shipping information\" stage.\n\nI reached out to Google's support today as I don't want to push this past my 15 day return window. \n\nThe response from Google?   \"The most effective way for you to handle this is to return to the store.\" This is AFTER I explain how far away it is.  I tell them that's not acceptable, and SORRY, CHARLIE!  That's all I'm getting. \n\nI can stomach (barely) paying $70 for $1.70 worth of Urethane because I know what design and tooling costs on plastics.

If this is a sign of the support I'll receive on the phone itself, I WILL drive back to the store and return the whole thing, Phone included!\n\nAnyone have ANY success stories on how to solve this?",

    "selftext": "There was a post on this topic from a year ago but it's locked and doesn't have any good responses.\n\nI was taking a photo of a shoe with my pixel 7 and one of my friends was in the background. The shoe was \\~5 inches from the phone camera and her face(\\~5 feet away) was completely blurred out due to the bokeh. This was intentional and exactly the effect I wanted. I took the pic and it looked fine so I moved on. 2 days later I went back to look at it, and it has horrifyingly sharpened her face and her features look reminiscent of the old DALL-E mini ai generated images and the picture now has the \"Face Unblur\" tag in google photos. \n\nHow can I remove this or revert it back to what it was? It looks awful and is not at all what I wanted. Additionally, can I turn this feature off? If it's not going to work (I have 100s of blurry photos) then I don't think I want it on.\n\nThank you in advance!",

In any case, I presume the handset price wouldn't drop down beyond the RRP of the current free gift the Pixel Buds - £219?\nIf it did drop down by around £200 for Black Friday I would rather go for that than the current free Buds offer, if it was only like £100 then I would rather just take the Buds now instead.\n\nI don't have anything to trade in, so enhanced trade in offers would make no difference to me, so if that's all they end up doing for Black Friday I would have been better off with the current deal. \n\nI guess what I need from you all is reassurance that Google/other reputable retailers have a consistent history of dropping the Pixel handset price by at least £200 every Black Friday, is there a consistent track record of this? \n\nMany many thanks!",

Either way, I noticed it wasn't due to a bad connection, the phone had rebooted? Weird, a couple minutes goes by and it happens again.\n\nThis time I keep my eyes on the phone to see what's going on, and it looked like Gemini was being pulled up. I then turn off microphone access cause I was thinking maybe my audio book was triggering some weird \"turn off\" microphone command. Well then my phone acts even stranger. Reboots again and this time whenever I press the sleep button, it opens up the camera and then proceeds to prompt me to unblock the microphone, then it pulls up Gemini again. This literally repeats 4 or 5 times before I get freaked out and put it in airplane mode as a precaution. I get to work and turn off airplane mode and it hasn't occured since. \n\nI don't think it's hacking but it really felt like my phone was not listening to my commands and someone else was taking over the screen and trying to run Gemini. Anyone else see this behavior before? ",

If you want to use AI, it is Gemini or CPU rendering.\n\nQualcomm in other hand, does not advertise it much but you can take any high-end Qualcomm chipset and run local AI models in 1/100 the time due NPU acceleration (QNN)\n\nI have a 2022 old Sony phone, and I can produce AI images in 5 seconds while my Pixel 9 Pro takes almost almost 2 minutes due CPU processing.\n\n\\--\n\nBefore someone comes to talk to me about the miracles/horrors of Google AI Gallery or LiteRT, I think this is still bare-bones. You can see at their github page, they promote Google Tensor as \"Coming soon\".\n\nEdge Torch - The tool doing LLM model conversion - refers itself as \"broad CPU coverage, with **initial** GPU and NPU support\". This project started a year ago.\n\nThis to me is surprising, again, considering Google broadly talking about AI into Pixel phones but having nothing (except own made solutions), and Qualcomm talking very little about own phone chipsets but supporting most of their high-end devices for a while.",

It’s been years.\n\nIt honestly feels like Google has stopped listening to its users.

The software stutters everywhere. The phone heats up while doing nothing. Heavy tasks? Don’t even think about it. Edge detection in portrait mode is still a joke — even random mid-range Chinese phones pull it off better. And we’re still missing portrait mode on the telephoto lens in 2025. Why?!\n\nAnd the worst part? That Sultan bug — the one that’s been around since 2023 — still not fixed. Like, how is this even acceptable? It’s been years.\n\nIt honestly feels like Google has stopped listening to its users. They’re too busy hyping up AI features no one asked for instead of fixing the core experience that made Pixels special in the first place.\n\nI used to love this phone — now I can barely use it without getting frustrated. Watching Google let the Pixel experience fall apart like this genuinely sucks.",

    "selftext": "Hey folks, hoping someone here has seen this before because I’m going crazy.\n\nMy sister has a Google Pixel (bought new earlier this year). She recently **forgot her screen lock code**, so we had to **factory reset** the phone through recovery mode. Ever since, it’s completely stuck at the **FRP screen** saying:\n\n>\n\nWe *are* signing in with that exact account — the same Gmail she’s always used on this phone. We’ve reset the password, logged in successfully on other devices, even removed the Pixel from “Your Devices” in her Google Account. Still, the phone refuses to accept it and keeps showing that FRP message.\n\nHere’s what we’ve already tried:\n\n* Waited over **three days** after resetting the password (to bypass the 72-hour FRP delay).\n* Removed the device from her Google account and waited again.\n* Double-checked that the email and password are correct (copy/paste).\n* Attempted account recovery just to verify ownership.\n\nWhen trying to recover the account via phone number, the recovery screen even shows a **completely different email** as being linked — which makes zero sense because this number was only added recently and has *never* been tied to another Google account.\n\nSo right now we have a phone that’s totally unusable even though we can log into the correct Google account everywhere else. It feels like the FRP system has just bugged out and won’t recognize the legit owner anymore.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Has anyone else seen FRP get stuck like this after a password reset?\n2. Is there *any* legit way to make Google refresh or re-sync ownership on their side?\n3. Would contacting Google Support with proof of purchase and IMEI actually help?\n4. Any other ideas before this thing becomes an expensive paperweight?\n\nWe don’t want to mess with shady bypass tools — just looking for a proper fix. Any help or firsthand experiences appreciated!",

    "selftext": "Recently bought a pixel 10 pro. It was basically free on my phone plan so it seemed like a no-brainer to at least try it. Was excited for the AI features and the better spam blocking than my prior s24+ . \n\nI'm having some issues with it though and wondering if I got a bad phone, if these issues are common, and if there are fixes. They are more annoying than deal breakers so as of now I think I would still stick with the pixel 10 pro because of the benefits it has. It would be nice to resolve some of these though.\n\nIssues\n- YouTube sometimes slow . Shorts don't load . This is rare. \n- on screen buttons not registering my touch sometimes. Not sure if it is more sensitive to placement than my prior phone but I have noticed a handful of times in multiple apps that this is the case. YouTube, obsidian , chrome\n- content and sometimes buttons are only partly on the screen in some apps. Maybe this is typical on the smaller devices. The pixel 10 corners also seem more rounded than my s24+\n- obsidian note taking app closes despite me trying every optimization I can find to keep it open. \n- obsidian links do not render as links sometimes in edit mode. They do render if I turn to view mode. Just checked and obsidian on the s24+ doesn't have this issue. \n- swiping doesn't work as consistently. Reddit app, my open app drawer, ect. I have to swipe further across for it to fully switch to the next thing. Just tried on the s24+ end it doesn't have this issue despite being a bigger screen. ",

Edge detection in portrait mode is still a joke — even random mid-range Chinese phones pull it off better. And we’re still missing portrait mode on the telephoto lens in 2025. Why?!\n\nAnd the worst part? That Sultan bug — the one that’s been around since 2023 — still not fixed. Like, how is this even acceptable? It’s been years.\n\nIt honestly feels like Google has stopped listening to its users. They’re too busy hyping up AI features no one asked for instead of fixing the core experience that made Pixels special in the first place.\n\nI used to love this phone — now I can barely use it without getting frustrated.

    "selftext": "Hey folks, hoping someone here has seen this before because I’m going crazy.\n\nMy sister has a Google Pixel (bought new earlier this year). She recently **forgot her screen lock code**, so we had to **factory reset** the phone through recovery mode. Ever since, it’s completely stuck at the **FRP screen** saying:\n\n>\n\nWe *are* signing in with that exact account — the same Gmail she’s always used on this phone. We’ve reset the password, logged in successfully on other devices, even removed the Pixel from “Your Devices” in her Google Account. Still, the phone refuses to accept it and keeps showing that FRP message.\n\nHere’s what we’ve already tried:\n\n* Waited over **three days** after resetting the password (to bypass the 72-hour FRP delay).\n* Removed the device from her Google account and waited again.\n* Double-checked that the email and password are correct (copy/paste).\n* Attempted account recovery just to verify ownership.\n\nWhen trying to recover the account via phone number, the recovery screen even shows a **completely different email** as being linked — which makes zero sense because this number was only added recently and has *never* been tied to another Google account.\n\nSo right now we have a phone that’s totally unusable even though we can log into the correct Google account everywhere else. It feels like the FRP system has just bugged out and won’t recognize the legit owner anymore.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Has anyone else seen FRP get stuck like this after a password reset?\n2. Is there *any* legit way to make Google refresh or re-sync ownership on their side?\n3. Would contacting Google Support with proof of purchase and IMEI actually help?\n4. Any other ideas before this thing becomes an expensive paperweight?\n\nWe don’t want to mess with shady bypass tools — just looking for a proper fix. Any help or firsthand experiences appreciated!",

    "selftext": "Recently bought a pixel 10 pro. It was basically free on my phone plan so it seemed like a no-brainer to at least try it. Was excited for the AI features and the better spam blocking than my prior s24+ . \n\nI'm having some issues with it though and wondering if I got a bad phone, if these issues are common, and if there are fixes. They are more annoying than deal breakers so as of now I think I would still stick with the pixel 10 pro because of the benefits it has. It would be nice to resolve some of these though.\n\nIssues\n- YouTube sometimes slow . Shorts don't load . This is rare. \n- on screen buttons not registering my touch sometimes. Not sure if it is more sensitive to placement than my prior phone but I have noticed a handful of times in multiple apps that this is the case. YouTube, obsidian , chrome\n- content and sometimes buttons are only partly on the screen in some apps. Maybe this is typical on the smaller devices. The pixel 10 corners also seem more rounded than my s24+\n- obsidian note taking app closes despite me trying every optimization I can find to keep it open. \n- obsidian links do not render as links sometimes in edit mode. They do render if I turn to view mode. Just checked and obsidian on the s24+ doesn't have this issue. \n- swiping doesn't work as consistently. Reddit app, my open app drawer, ect. I have to swipe further across for it to fully switch to the next thing. Just tried on the s24+ end it doesn't have this issue despite being a bigger screen. ",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "to make a long story short, i work at a computer repair shop, and we often have people come in with cellphones, which we almost always direct over to the local cellphone repair shop. we have an agreement that if we get a cellphone repair request we send them to their shop, and if they get a laptop repair request they send them to our shop\n\nbut with the issues where people are having with samsung galaxy ring batteries swelling, im not sure if i should send them to the cellphone repair shop, or the hospital.\n\nthis isnt a joke meme post, ive just heard that hospitals have a hard time removing the rings because of the nature of the battery in the ring meaning the ring cant just be cut off in the normal way they would a stuck ring, so im really not sure what to do in that situation\n\ni dont have anything much aganst samsung, asside from the annoyance of apps with the appliances my landlord has recently installed in our apartment (im not a fan of needing an app to access all the features of my stove) cause samsung phones are not bad, not the best option in my opinion but if you have the money to spend they are the apple of the android world and so i get it.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "title": "My Unlocked S25 Ultra from BestBuy Disabled After 6 Months",
    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

    "selftext": "My experience with [samsung.com](http://samsung.com/) was awful. I preordered the Z Flip 7 the 20th of july, while there was the promotion of the free galaxy buds pro 3 while giving my Z Flip 6 for trade in, so i ended up paying around 380€ for the phone, earbuds and galaxy Watch 8 Classic.\n\nIt's been a month and a half, the site said it would've been sent by the 4th of August but still my order is \"pending\" on their site with no update since they got my money on july 20th. I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

I eventually switched to iPhone with the 12 Pro, and 5 years later it still feels just as smooth as the day I got it.\n\nNow I’m considering going back to Android with the S26, but I don’t want to deal with the same old performance issues if Samsung hasn’t really fixed this.\n\nFor those of you who’ve stuck with Samsung in recent years, how does long-term performance hold up? Are they still prone to slowing down or is it finally on par with iOS for longevity?",

But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

I absolutely love it, i put it on the wall and its nicely up there.\n\nMy only concern is, the 2 top screws only screwed in a few turns before becoming tight. No cross thread as I pulled it out and did it again on both 2 or 3 times to be certain.\n\nHas anyone else found that the thread depth isn't very deep on the top 2 screws for mounting?\n\nConsidering taking it down and quadruple checking but wanting to leave it.\n\nIts been 24 hours now, no movement so want to leave it on the wall but the anxiety in the back of my mind tells me otherwise. I fear ill keep going in circles and eventually ruin it myself.\n\nMake me feel better please haha.\n\n❤️",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn.

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use?

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

But if it's damn near microscopic I cannot and it's really annoying on stage. Last time I had to pretend I was checking my steps in order to see what time I'm at. Does anybody know how I can set it to the old way where it takes up the whole screen? It also does this for the timer, which is also annoying when I'm at the gym and it minimizes it when I'm doing 1 minute reps. But that's not as essential. I have googled other reddit posts but they're all old/out dated/have instructions to options that no longer exist. I'd really appreciate some help. Thank you! ",

    "selftext": "So...... my phone (S21 Ultra) took a dive in a swimming pool.   I caught it before it hit bottom, immediately turned it off, and hung it ports down above a fan (I read that it will dry better in open air than in rice), but it's not looking good.   It may have been water resistant enough to survive a quick dunk when it was new, but the years apparently degraded that.   It's been hanging above the fan for 5 days and counting, and this morning it still wouldn't turn on, and when I plug it in it shows the charging icon for about 3 seconds, then nothing.\n\nSo why am I telling you this in r/GalaxyWatch ?    Because I got an S25 Ultra to replace it, but I had to reset my GW3 to connect it to the S25 Ultra, and I lost my favorite watchface (pay no attention to the 8% battery.... I stole someone else's picture of the watchface.)\n\nI'd thought a little about upgrading the GW3, but it's about 32nd on the list, since the GW3 still does everything I want it to do.   With support for Tizen ending, I may need to move it up on my list?\n\nSo I'm wondering if the Bluestealth watchface (or something very like it) is available for newer Galaxy watches?\n\nI still have my OG Galaxy Watch in a drawer, I haven't reset it, and it still has the Bluestealth watchface.   Is there any way to recover the watchface from the OG GW to the GW3 to at least tide me over until I decide to upgrade to a newer watch?",

    "selftext": "Hey y'all! I'm thinking of buying my first Galaxy Watch, and I need some help deciding. \n\nFor background: \n\n- I use a Galaxy S23 phone and Galaxy Buds 2. My current watch is a simple FitBit Versa 3 (so any Galaxy watch will be an upgrade lol).\n\n- I mainly wish to use the watch as an extension of my phone (texting, calling, music control, etc) with my phone nearby, so the LTE function won't be a necessity.\n\n- The main secondary purpose I need my watch for is fitness tracking: Tracking heart rate, steps, calories, distance, etc.\n\nI am on the fence right now. I have found a 47mm Galaxy 6 Classic for quite a good deal ($109 for the bluetooth OR LTE model), and that is the model I'm leaning towards. But before I buy, I want to know if paying an extra $100-$150 for the Galaxy 7 would be worth it for any newer specs or features that it has. \n\nI won't be using my watch as much for temperature tracking and GPS purposes (beyond tracking running/biking distance which I can also have my phone on me for). \n\nI also dont plan to download a ton of apps (mainly the defaults, a few interchangable watch faces, timer, calorie tracking, metronome, Spotify control, and possibly 1 or 2 games) so I'm unsure of how much of an impact the 16GB to 32GB difference would make on my satisfaction with either one. \n\nPlease, any insight, advice, and experience would be greatly appreciated!

    "selftext": "Hello all, im just wondering if anyone has had this experience since the OneUI 8 update. Now, i will clarify a few things:\n\n1. I use the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024)\n2. I've had the update for about 2-3 months\n\nI recently started running again, I started taking it seriously back in June (pre-update). When I was running then, I would do as I still do today; start the 'Running' exercise on Samsung Health (on the watch) and crack on. The activity face would report my live pace and report the split every km - if I ran at a  6:00/km then the split readout wouldn't report a 6:00/km pace.\n\nHowever, since the last major update (OneUI 8) on the watch, the live pace has been way off. This is my current experience: I start the 'Running' activity I crack on and check the live pace its reading 6:30. When I hit the first split and the readout occurs, its reading ~30s faster such as 'lap pace, 5:57/km' - and this is the split that is recorded after I finish the activity. So what has happened to the live readings? It's been like this for months, at this point, i am just used to it and just use the incorrect live pace, knowing what it is roughly and just read the split readout for the correct information. Has anyone else experienced this, from OneUI 7 > OneUI 8? I don't know if this is Watch Ultra specific issue or across the product range.\n\nTLDR: Live running pace used to be relatively accurate, since One UI 8 update, the live pace is reported as a much slower pace than what the actual pace is.",

    "selftext": "I have been a long time smartwatch user and have tried a lot of brands. I have mostly settled on Samsung and Amazfit but each is missing something. This is short wish list of changes for Galaxy watches:\n\n  \n1) **let me swipe away individual notifications**. Right now, I have to clear all of them at once, or tap on each one and clear it. I would rather just swipe from the list to do some quick triaging;\n\n2) **improve the step count deduping** between watch and phone. Right now it really seems to overcount, so I just turn off step counting on my phone, which is a shame because it would be nice to track some steps while my watch is charging\n\n3) **add Energy Score to the Galaxy Fit 3.** that would make it a great companion to the Galaxy watch. I could wear it at night for seemless tracking. I also prefer it for some sports where I want a smaller, lighter device and I dont need GPS\n\n  \n4) **Make message replies via voice faster**. On Amazfit, I can tap the notification, then hold down a button to active the voice assistant and can directly dictate. On WearOS, it takes a lot of taps to do that (tap the notification, open on watch, reply, keyboard, swipe up to select different keyboards, tap the microphone icon)\n\n  \n5) **consider swiping up for notifications and using both left and right swipes to access tiles**. That lets me get at my 2 most important tiles with a single swipe.\n\n  \n5a) *bonus* \\- **consider a shortcut tile**. Amazfit does this well and has it as a list you can scroll through. Galaxy watches have this a bit with the new tile designs but it still caps at 4.\n\n\n\nThese are just my thoughts. Maybe it's just me :)",

For now, tho, I only own a Galaxy Tab S9 and I'm waiting for black friday to buy a Galaxy Phone. \n\nI saw that, sadly, you can't setup your Galaxy Watch with a Tab, so I was wondering a few things: can you use it at all with a Tab or not? If not, can you use it alone? If so, should I use it already or should I wait over a month and use it when I get the phone? \n\nThanks a lot, really??",

The watch correctly paused the workout, but when we started moving again, I noticed later that it never resumed tracking. Result: I lost a big chunk of my ride data.\n\nToday, I went cycling again and took a short break. The watch paused as expected. When I started riding back home, I remembered the issue from yesterday and checked: it was still paused, even though I was already moving. I manually resumed it and finished the ride, but when I got home, I saw that it tracked the time of my return but didn’t record the route on the map. So the saved activity shows double the duration and only half the distance, ending exactly where it paused during my break.\n\nNot sure if a factory reset would fix this. For now, I’ll try disabling auto-pause and rely on manual pausing/unpausing, hoping it doesn’t bug out again. Otherwise, I might have to ditch Samsung Health and just record directly on Strava.\n\nAnyone else running into this issue?",

The official samsung support is currently unavailable since it's Sunday, but judging by how hard it was to find the phone number or live chat link and fight with AI assistant to conn3ect me with human I can only hope they will help. \n\nI can post the full video of the steps I take if my internet-taught english isn't that good. \n\nAlso if my post dosen't fit the subreddit, I would really appreciate if you could point me to a right page, and I will immidietly delete this post.

    "selftext": "I recently got myself a Galaxy Watch 8 and on my first cycling activity ever the HR zones guide screen got stuck during the activity. It's not like the watch is hung, but on the activity screen it will keep showing only which HR Zones you are on right now. Pressing the button would let you pause or resume activity but the HR screen just remains and won't let you see the other vital information. The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time. Later I found a work around, you need to open Samsung Health app on your phone then select the activity again which kinda resets the screen, but this is such a hassle to do mid ride when you can't even see the time. I used a Galaxy Watch 4 for a short time and it never had this problem, only on my new watch I'm experiencing this bug. \n\nAnyone else experienceing this issue?",

It also does this for the timer, which is also annoying when I'm at the gym and it minimizes it when I'm doing 1 minute reps. But that's not as essential.

I caught it before it hit bottom, immediately turned it off, and hung it ports down above a fan (I read that it will dry better in open air than in rice), but it's not looking good.   It may have been water resistant enough to survive a quick dunk when it was new, but the years apparently degraded that.   It's been hanging above the fan for 5 days and counting, and this morning it still wouldn't turn on, and when I plug it in it shows the charging icon for about 3 seconds, then nothing.\n\nSo why am I telling you this in r/GalaxyWatch ?    Because I got an S25 Ultra to replace it, but I had to reset my GW3 to connect it to the S25 Ultra, and I lost my favorite watchface (pay no attention to the 8% battery.... I stole someone else's picture of the watchface.)\n\nI'd thought a little about upgrading the GW3, but it's about 32nd on the list, since the GW3 still does everything I want it to do.   With support for Tizen ending, I may need to move it up on my list?\n\nSo I'm wondering if the Bluestealth watchface (or something very like it) is available for newer Galaxy watches?\n\nI still have my OG Galaxy Watch in a drawer, I haven't reset it, and it still has the Bluestealth watchface.   Is there any way to recover the watchface from the OG GW to the GW3 to at least tide me over until I decide to upgrade to a newer watch?",

It turns out that there is a maximum number of alarms you can have in your Alarm app. I deleted all my alarms and tried setting a new one again, and it worked without any errors.\n\nI discovered this because when I attempted to set an alarm using Bixby, it informed me that I had reached the maximum number of alarms. However, when using Gemini, it simply gives an \"UNKNOWN ERROR\" message, even though it behaves as if the alarm was set. If you're not checking the watch display after asking Gemini, you might not even realize there's been an error.\n\nThanks to everyone who tried to help me earlier!",

    "selftext": "# 💻 Seeking Advice: Best Laptop for Programming & Light Gaming (Under $700 Budget) 🚀\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm starting my studies in programming/software development and need a new laptop that can handle my coding workload but also offer a decent experience for some casual gaming on the side.\n\nMy budget is **around $700 USD**, but I can be flexible for a truly worthwhile upgrade.\n\n\n\n# 1. My Priorities:\n\n\n\n* **Primary Use:** Heavy programming, coding, running IDEs, virtual environments, and general productivity.\n* **Secondary Use (Gaming):** Light gaming only (nothing AAA like Cyberpunk). I want to run simple games with the **best possible graphics settings** while keeping the laptop relatively simple and functional.\n* **CRITICAL CONCERN: Noise (Fans):** I will be using this laptop frequently in quiet classroom settings. I need to know if I should expect the fans to spin up loudly during heavy programming tasks (like compiling large projects) on a budget gaming or performance laptop. **How loud will it get during a coding session?**\n\n\n\n# 2. The Budget Conundrum: Laptop vs. Handheld\n\n\n\nI'm considering two main options given the price point:\n\n**Option A (The Hybrid):** Buy a budget gaming laptop (e.g., one with an RTX 3050 or similar) that covers both coding and light gaming.\n\n**Option B (The Split):** Buy a very quiet and high-performance **productivity laptop** (focusing on a strong CPU and 16GB RAM for coding) and use the remaining budget (or slightly more) to purchase a dedicated **gaming handheld console** (like a Steam Deck or used ROG Ally) for the light gaming.\n\n**Which option do you think provides the best value and solves my fan noise problem in the classroom?**\n\n\n\n# 3. Recommendations Needed\n\n\n\nWhat specific laptop models (or configurations) would you recommend that hit this sweet spot, especially those known for having **decent cooling/noise management**?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

Here’s what’s happening:\n\nLaptop powers on: keyboard lights turn on, fans spin\n\nScreen stays completely black\n\nExternal monitor via HDMI only shows the desktop after I log in\n\nKeyboard lights behave oddly: Fn+Space works to toggle keyboard backlight, but Caps Lock and Escape lights stay on and don’t toggle\n\nI haven’t touched anything except the hinges\n\n\nI’ve tried:\n\nUsing an external display (works only after login)\n\nObserving the screen in a dark room for faint images (can’t see anything)\n\n\nI suspect it might be a loose or damaged display cable due to the hinge, but I’m not sure.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? How can I safely test if the internal screen or cable is damaged, or if the backlight is dead? Any guidance would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

I am waiting on black Friday but have found two that I really like. I'd rather purchase from Best buy as I have a membership there.\n\nI'm looking for at least 16gb ram, 1tb SSD and it MUST be about 14\" as I don't like bigger laptops. I don't play too much, the only games I have are Sims 4, Fortnite and the new Hobbit cozy game. I do use Lightroom a lot, and very occasionally practice coding (I'm no expert)\n\nI've been looking at the HP Omnibook X 14 2-in-1 and the Dell 14 Plus 2-in-1 They both come out in the Intel 7 and Ryzen AI 7 versions. If someone could help me with the pros and cons of each version for what I need the laptop for would be very helpful.\n\nOr if you have any other suggestions I'd appreciate them too.\n\nHonestly a graphics card would be nice but those types are mostly 15.6\" and way out of my budget :( my old laptop is a Lenovo flex 5 1470 with a GeForce 940mx",

USA\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes.\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** 2-in-1 please, 64 gb RAM / high performance, battery life not that important since I may be carrying battery charging packs or charging it (will be using 50% max battery charge limit), 1 TB or more of storage space.\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not that important anymore, just need something to get the work done as a student (I have a lot of tabs and programs open), whatever I can carry around and write on the side with some paper or on the tablet-laptop (2-in-1). \n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** N/A.\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** No... I already have an addiction to video gaming I would say, but I would say \"N/A\" here, I am doing some research projects though and I need a lot of RAM. Nothing too fancy for a graphics card is needed per se, just need a lot of RAM since I will have a bunch of programs open.\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A.\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Touchscreen, I want to be able to draw on it so I can make notes or drawings digitally for notetaking / studying purposes.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Notetaking/studying purposes, something that is \"good\" for students to work with on.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOriginal post:\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for a 2-in-1 laptop?\n\nI liked using Surface Pro laptops but I probably may need to pick something slightly cheaper\n\n  \nI looked into Dell 2-in-1 laptops...\n\n  \nI also see Lenovo laptops\n\nSomeone in an other post [https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1l8fcnh/what\\_are\\_your\\_thoughts\\_on\\_2in1\\_laptops/](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1l8fcnh/what_are_your_thoughts_on_2in1_laptops/) mentioned not to \"go budget\" which is not very clear to me -- what do they mean by \"budget\"? What counts in their mind as a \"budget/bad\" laptop?\n\nJust to be clear here, I am not asking for a \"bad\" laptop when I say budget... looking for something between the best of both worlds.\n\nIdeally something around \\~ $1,000 might be around my max price \n\n  \nThe Surface Pro laptop I wanted was \\~ $2,000 which I would love but need to save money right now.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n  \n(Back to  [https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1l8fcnh/what\\_are\\_your\\_thoughts\\_on\\_2in1\\_laptops/](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1l8fcnh/what_are_your_thoughts_on_2in1_laptops/) )\n\n\n\nSo, would that person in the other post consider a \"budget\" laptop to be \\~$1,000 or are they talking about something below \\~$300? Since I see some results for that like around \\~$260 or \\~$270, perhaps that's what they meant by a \"bad budget\" 2-in-1 laptop?\n\n\n\nWhat do you all recommend? ",

For days I've been trying to figure everything out then I got in my laptop again. I used it just to browse and discord. I got BSOD again. \n\nIt also affected the power mechanism. Like when I shut it down, the fans keeps on spinning and the keyboard stays lit up. I have to press the button long to turn it off completely. Then when I try to turn it on, it doesn't. I have to always press it for 30 secs and let it rest for a couple of minutes to make it work again. Also when I try to restart, it just shuts down the laptop. Doesn't turn on again \n\nSo I got frustrated and decided to reformat my laptop with rufus to a usb stick. After long nights of searching cuz my USB stick doesn't appear on my BIOS, I just ran the .exe file on the computer. It was installing windows 11. After it finished, windows said it'll restart my laptop. It tried but again, it didn't restart. Just shut down.\n\nI turned it on, it was showing like 4 lines information about my memory and it was loading and it loaded 100% 16GB. Then, nothing happened. I turned it off and on again. This time it says no bootable device. I did that twice and same shi showed up. The 3rd time, now I get stucked here. I can't even see my BIOS or the ACER Logo... \n\nCan anybody help me?

I came here to ask what laptop is best for me to get, I've had lot of problems lately with my laptop of the Brand HP.\n\nIt's really slow, even though it's on the latest update and has most of his memory free (I've only used 100GB from the 400GB that it has). I've deleted archives and other heavy things but it still keeps getting slower. \n\nThe pages freeze out of nowhere and it takes me normally 30 minutes to only open a small archive. It's frustrating, I need a fast device for my school investigations and etc, when you investigate you have a lot of pages open and my laptop just becomes crazy. \n\nBtw, I've also brought it to a technician 2 times before writing this. The modifications help only for a couple of days and then the laptop gets slower than before.\n\nI need something fast and with a big amount of memory, maybe one similar to the ones that gamers use, idk. I've been looking for some days in stores, but I want to get an answer from someone that knows about the subject.\n\nThank you in advance.",

So I expected good quality. \n\nThe laptop keeps disconnecting from the wifi after about 20 minutes. And then the wifi settings dissappear until I restarted the laptop. I assumed it was a driver related issue,but everything is up to date and I returned it to him to manually install all updates- the problem still persists. \n\nSecondly, if I put the cpu under strain (multitasking, many tabs) the laptop sometimes freezes and goes to a blue screen, which does not dissappear until restarting. \n\nThe guy has been very kind and offered to reset and reload windows + drivers and see if the problem persists. If it persists he is willing to give me a replacement model. \n\nShould I ask for a refund and buy new (if he will), do you think this is fixable, is this a common issue with the hp probook and if I get a replacement model can I expect the same?",

Now, I don’t care at all about the webcam so thought I could disconnect it but as seen on the second image, this wire also seems to join with the monitor backlight or similar.

    "title": "\"Laptop On Rails\" - A new approach to laptop cooling. 2025 idea -> 2025 solution.",
    "selftext": "Finally we made something that works great! Hello, and thank you all for so many views and likes and comments under my previous posts. We got 100k views on my 2 previous posts relating to my ideas for solution.\n\nI had the same problem of overheating laptop, even on low CPU usage, so I was trying every market available solution. I already had a cooling pad, that I bought from one platform. But it was so bad, that i put it away to collect dust. Cheap plastic and metal mesh, that went completely broken when i collected the luggage from my arrival flight to Bucharest. A loose USB plug that i never knew if it was on or off. Plus I did not like the idea of something that makes my laptop very unstable, lift by an inch from the surface, make my wrists at strange angles, occupate USB, sound strange, and also not be able to \"push\" my laptop further away from me. So for me a laptop stand would be a huge compromise, that I couldn't accept, and opted out.\n\nThe second wide known option is a \"laptop lifter\" - the stand that lifts laptop off the ground. I did not really try it, but by the looks, it also causes one big problem: It gives an impression of \"Quake\" (i call it a visual concept, a braintrap, where I feel like being inside the Quake game, where you look at the objects at strange angles, and the game Quake and it's 3d engine, is know for strange 3D FOV) - So you need to see your laptop keyboard at unnatural angle which distracts you from work on the computer, plus laptop is also \"lift\" from the table, causing a static gravity object to become somehow \"in air\" and for my brain, it was simply to much to think of trying it out. Plus, you also can't use your touchpad (I use it a lot, i got 4-fingers shortcuts assigned to volume up/down), you need to buy an extra keyboard, etc, etc.\n\nSo what i did, i just simply created \"rails\" that push the notebook further away.\n\nThe problems it solves:\n\n\\- 100% passive cooling\n\n\\- air flows freely, lot of space\n\n\\- very stable\n\n\\- hands lay \"painocomfy\"\n\n\\- moving your hands horizontally, at natural angle on the keyboaard\n\n\\- USB port freed\n\n\\- no \"Quake effect\"\n\n\\- 0 heat onto table\n\n\\- proper sitting position\n\n\\- using my laptop keyboard that i am used to\n\n\\- can attach extra devices on laptop (2 heavy mobile phones on the photo)\n\n\\- a lot of space for books, dinners, \n\n\\- quick attachment/ detachment system\n\n\\- easy to detach, without destroying the surface of the table\n\n\\- and more.\n\nI understand that many of you might be used to keep your table on the wall, but for me it was a choice: \"either i keep smoking my laptop, or i just pull the table away this 10 cm and chill\"\n\nPS: I invented also 3 other new cooling methods, plus 1 cooling system specifically for using laptops in a bed. I already got working prototypes of these three, so stay tuned...\n\nFeel free to ask questions about the \"Laptop on Rails\" viral project and if you think it is cool or do you stand by standard and commercial solutions!",

Here's what i need from a laptop:\n\n\\- not to be an Apple product\n\n\\- 14'', ideally 16x10, with refresh rate >60hz, and nits enough to work in a sunlit room\n\n\\- decent CPU performance - mostly for programming, big projects on Go, Rust etc., some docker containers, that kind of stuff\n\n\\- 32 Gb of RAM or more\n\n\\- reasonable battery life - ideally i need it to last 8 hours, even if that would be in battery saving mode\n\n\\- usb-c with PD and DP for an external monitor\n\n\\- as lightweight as possible considering the battery life\n\n\\- as silent as possible\n\nNow i work on Asus Zenbook 14 UM3402Y with Ryzen 7730U and 16 Gb RAM so it's a low bar for a new one to overcome.  But i like how lightweight and silent it is - after changing thermal goo for a better one it just doesn't turn fans at all, except heavy loads. Also the battery life is ok. That was the reason i sticked with it for like two years.\n\nI don't care for premium materials, sound, chassis flex, one-handed opening or pretty much anything aside the specs i mentioned. The price is also not REALLY a stopping factor, but of course if there is a chance not to splurge I'd gladly would.\n\nI also looked at something like Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 with 5070Ti. I understand that it comes with discrete GPU downsides like weight, heat, noise, and low battery life (and small formfactor downsides like low allowed TDP), but it still looks tempting ngl. Maybe someone with similar use cases had to try that one or something similar like Razer Blade and have something to say about it?\n\nThanks in advance for everyone in this thread.",

    "selftext": "I left the room for 10 minutes not even gaming or many chrome tabs open or something of the sort, came back to the laptop being off and have been unable to turn on since, can't get anything on screen (or monitor) When I hold the power button on both of the fans spin for about a second. I've taken it to two repair shops both had no clue what might be wrong with it as they couldn't get it to boot either.\n\nI've tried everything I know that might help such as a general clean, taking out ram sticks and ssd putting it back in, disconnecting the battery putting it back, same thing with CMOS battery and neither seem dead checking with a multimeter, tried to turn on plugged into power with no battery, drained the battery charged it again and all that. After all the things I've tried my guess would be somehow a faulty motherboard, or some kind of bios update that started while I wasn't in the room and screwed up halfway through but I have no idea.\n\nI'm not certain what these black texter marks signify on certain screws and the battery connector, but does anyone know if something is wrong with this part here? (**1st picture with yellow arrow**) To me I can't tell if it's just texter, possibly that that's the way these ones are (a little darker, smaller or missing) or they do kind of look to me like it possibly short circuited. If any thing else looks fishy please do tell as I might have unknowingly reconnected something improperly or something dumb, but to me that's the only part that I kind think looks odd.\n\nGenerally speaking I believe I took good care of it wouldn't let it get too hot while gaming, would take breaks, used a little angled laptop riser so it should've have had decent airflow all the time, I would never leave it on overnight or while leaving the house for hours, never overclocked or anything like that I don't know how or sure if it even can. It had a 2 year warranty from Centre Com but I had it for almost 3 years, this did occur early last year (only just took the pictures) Also was just running windows 11.

I've looked all kinds of laptop and maybe the best two brands are Asus and Lenovo( is it?) if so, which is better? I've found IdeaPad that are good, Asus ZenBook and Asus vivo book even Asus gaming f15/f16 but they are for gaming mostly. I really don't know which is better, I've been looking even for CPU benchmark tests but the rating for them is almost the same. Does anyone have some tips? What should I do? I wanna have a good deal and a performing PC for my budget. Can anyone help? Thanks",

    "selftext": "# 💻 Seeking Advice: Best Laptop for Programming & Light Gaming (Under $700 Budget) 🚀\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm starting my studies in programming/software development and need a new laptop that can handle my coding workload but also offer a decent experience for some casual gaming on the side.\n\nMy budget is **around $700 USD**, but I can be flexible for a truly worthwhile upgrade.\n\n\n\n# 1. My Priorities:\n\n\n\n* **Primary Use:** Heavy programming, coding, running IDEs, virtual environments, and general productivity.\n* **Secondary Use (Gaming):** Light gaming only (nothing AAA like Cyberpunk). I want to run simple games with the **best possible graphics settings** while keeping the laptop relatively simple and functional.\n* **CRITICAL CONCERN: Noise (Fans):** I will be using this laptop frequently in quiet classroom settings. I need to know if I should expect the fans to spin up loudly during heavy programming tasks (like compiling large projects) on a budget gaming or performance laptop. **How loud will it get during a coding session?**\n\n\n\n# 2. The Budget Conundrum: Laptop vs. Handheld\n\n\n\nI'm considering two main options given the price point:\n\n**Option A (The Hybrid):** Buy a budget gaming laptop (e.g., one with an RTX 3050 or similar) that covers both coding and light gaming.\n\n**Option B (The Split):** Buy a very quiet and high-performance **productivity laptop** (focusing on a strong CPU and 16GB RAM for coding) and use the remaining budget (or slightly more) to purchase a dedicated **gaming handheld console** (like a Steam Deck or used ROG Ally) for the light gaming.\n\n**Which option do you think provides the best value and solves my fan noise problem in the classroom?**\n\n\n\n# 3. Recommendations Needed\n\n\n\nWhat specific laptop models (or configurations) would you recommend that hit this sweet spot, especially those known for having **decent cooling/noise management**?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

    "title": "\"Laptop On Rails\" - A new approach to laptop cooling. 2025 idea -> 2025 solution.",
    "selftext": "Finally we made something that works great! Hello, and thank you all for so many views and likes and comments under my previous posts. We got 100k views on my 2 previous posts relating to my ideas for solution.\n\nI had the same problem of overheating laptop, even on low CPU usage, so I was trying every market available solution. I already had a cooling pad, that I bought from one platform. But it was so bad, that i put it away to collect dust. Cheap plastic and metal mesh, that went completely broken when i collected the luggage from my arrival flight to Bucharest. A loose USB plug that i never knew if it was on or off. Plus I did not like the idea of something that makes my laptop very unstable, lift by an inch from the surface, make my wrists at strange angles, occupate USB, sound strange, and also not be able to \"push\" my laptop further away from me. So for me a laptop stand would be a huge compromise, that I couldn't accept, and opted out.\n\nThe second wide known option is a \"laptop lifter\" - the stand that lifts laptop off the ground. I did not really try it, but by the looks, it also causes one big problem: It gives an impression of \"Quake\" (i call it a visual concept, a braintrap, where I feel like being inside the Quake game, where you look at the objects at strange angles, and the game Quake and it's 3d engine, is know for strange 3D FOV) - So you need to see your laptop keyboard at unnatural angle which distracts you from work on the computer, plus laptop is also \"lift\" from the table, causing a static gravity object to become somehow \"in air\" and for my brain, it was simply to much to think of trying it out. Plus, you also can't use your touchpad (I use it a lot, i got 4-fingers shortcuts assigned to volume up/down), you need to buy an extra keyboard, etc, etc.\n\nSo what i did, i just simply created \"rails\" that push the notebook further away.\n\nThe problems it solves:\n\n\\- 100% passive cooling\n\n\\- air flows freely, lot of space\n\n\\- very stable\n\n\\- hands lay \"painocomfy\"\n\n\\- moving your hands horizontally, at natural angle on the keyboaard\n\n\\- USB port freed\n\n\\- no \"Quake effect\"\n\n\\- 0 heat onto table\n\n\\- proper sitting position\n\n\\- using my laptop keyboard that i am used to\n\n\\- can attach extra devices on laptop (2 heavy mobile phones on the photo)\n\n\\- a lot of space for books, dinners, \n\n\\- quick attachment/ detachment system\n\n\\- easy to detach, without destroying the surface of the table\n\n\\- and more.\n\nI understand that many of you might be used to keep your table on the wall, but for me it was a choice: \"either i keep smoking my laptop, or i just pull the table away this 10 cm and chill\"\n\nPS: I invented also 3 other new cooling methods, plus 1 cooling system specifically for using laptops in a bed. I already got working prototypes of these three, so stay tuned...\n\nFeel free to ask questions about the \"Laptop on Rails\" viral project and if you think it is cool or do you stand by standard and commercial solutions!",

Here’s what’s happening:\n\nLaptop powers on: keyboard lights turn on, fans spin\n\nScreen stays completely black\n\nExternal monitor via HDMI only shows the desktop after I log in\n\nKeyboard lights behave oddly: Fn+Space works to toggle keyboard backlight, but Caps Lock and Escape lights stay on and don’t toggle\n\nI haven’t touched anything except the hinges\n\n\nI’ve tried:\n\nUsing an external display (works only after login)\n\nObserving the screen in a dark room for faint images (can’t see anything)\n\n\nI suspect it might be a loose or damaged display cable due to the hinge, but I’m not sure.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? How can I safely test if the internal screen or cable is damaged, or if the backlight is dead? Any guidance would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

I'd rather purchase from Best buy as I have a membership there.\n\nI'm looking for at least 16gb ram, 1tb SSD and it MUST be about 14\" as I don't like bigger laptops. I don't play too much, the only games I have are Sims 4, Fortnite and the new Hobbit cozy game. I do use Lightroom a lot, and very occasionally practice coding (I'm no expert)\n\nI've been looking at the HP Omnibook X 14 2-in-1 and the Dell 14 Plus 2-in-1 They both come out in the Intel 7 and Ryzen AI 7 versions. If someone could help me with the pros and cons of each version for what I need the laptop for would be very helpful.\n\nOr if you have any other suggestions I'd appreciate them too.\n\nHonestly a graphics card would be nice but those types are mostly 15.6\" and way out of my budget :( my old laptop is a Lenovo flex 5 1470 with a GeForce 940mx",

I've deleted archives and other heavy things but it still keeps getting slower. \n\nThe pages freeze out of nowhere and it takes me normally 30 minutes to only open a small archive. It's frustrating, I need a fast device for my school investigations and etc, when you investigate you have a lot of pages open and my laptop just becomes crazy. \n\nBtw, I've also brought it to a technician 2 times before writing this. The modifications help only for a couple of days and then the laptop gets slower than before.\n\nI need something fast and with a big amount of memory, maybe one similar to the ones that gamers use, idk.

What counts in their mind as a \"budget/bad\" laptop?\n\nJust to be clear here, I am not asking for a \"bad\" laptop when I say budget... looking for something between the best of both worlds.\n\nIdeally something around \\~ $1,000 might be around my max price \n\n  \nThe Surface Pro laptop I wanted was \\~ $2,000 which I would love but need to save money right now.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n  \n(Back to  [https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1l8fcnh/what\\_are\\_your\\_thoughts\\_on\\_2in1\\_laptops/](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1l8fcnh/what_are_your_thoughts_on_2in1_laptops/) )\n\n\n\nSo, would that person in the other post consider a \"budget\" laptop to be \\~$1,000 or are they talking about something below \\~$300?

    "selftext": "I have probably one of the worst case scenario that could happen in an Acer Nitro 5 AN515-58 model laptop. \n\nI was playing Valorant and all of a sudden I got blue screen of death. Stop code: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL\n\nI was able to open it again so I played again. Got the same error. This time when I opened it, I got an error INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE. For days I've been trying to figure everything out then I got in my laptop again. I used it just to browse and discord. I got BSOD again. \n\nIt also affected the power mechanism. Like when I shut it down, the fans keeps on spinning and the keyboard stays lit up. I have to press the button long to turn it off completely. Then when I try to turn it on, it doesn't. I have to always press it for 30 secs and let it rest for a couple of minutes to make it work again. Also when I try to restart, it just shuts down the laptop. Doesn't turn on again \n\nSo I got frustrated and decided to reformat my laptop with rufus to a usb stick. After long nights of searching cuz my USB stick doesn't appear on my BIOS, I just ran the .exe file on the computer. It was installing windows 11. After it finished, windows said it'll restart my laptop. It tried but again, it didn't restart. Just shut down.\n\nI turned it on, it was showing like 4 lines information about my memory and it was loading and it loaded 100% 16GB. Then, nothing happened. I turned it off and on again. This time it says no bootable device. I did that twice and same shi showed up. The 3rd time, now I get stucked here. I can't even see my BIOS or the ACER Logo... \n\nCan anybody help me? I just want to finish formatting my laptop so I can fkin sell this piece of shit",

    "title": "💻  Best Laptop for Programming & Light Gaming ?",
    "selftext": "# 💻 Seeking Advice: Best Laptop for Programming & Light Gaming (Under $700 Budget) 🚀\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm starting my studies in programming/software development and need a new laptop that can handle my coding workload but also offer a decent experience for some casual gaming on the side.\n\nMy budget is **around $700 USD**, but I can be flexible for a truly worthwhile upgrade.\n\n\n\n# 1. My Priorities:\n\n\n\n* **Primary Use:** Heavy programming, coding, running IDEs, virtual environments, and general productivity.\n* **Secondary Use (Gaming):** Light gaming only (nothing AAA like Cyberpunk). I want to run simple games with the **best possible graphics settings** while keeping the laptop relatively simple and functional.\n* **CRITICAL CONCERN: Noise (Fans):** I will be using this laptop frequently in quiet classroom settings. I need to know if I should expect the fans to spin up loudly during heavy programming tasks (like compiling large projects) on a budget gaming or performance laptop. **How loud will it get during a coding session?**\n\n\n\n# 2. The Budget Conundrum: Laptop vs. Handheld\n\n\n\nI'm considering two main options given the price point:\n\n**Option A (The Hybrid):** Buy a budget gaming laptop (e.g., one with an RTX 3050 or similar) that covers both coding and light gaming.\n\n**Option B (The Split):** Buy a very quiet and high-performance **productivity laptop** (focusing on a strong CPU and 16GB RAM for coding) and use the remaining budget (or slightly more) to purchase a dedicated **gaming handheld console** (like a Steam Deck or used ROG Ally) for the light gaming.\n\n**Which option do you think provides the best value and solves my fan noise problem in the classroom?**\n\n\n\n# 3. Recommendations Needed\n\n\n\nWhat specific laptop models (or configurations) would you recommend that hit this sweet spot, especially those known for having **decent cooling/noise management**?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

    "title": "\"Laptop On Rails\" - A new approach to laptop cooling. 2025 idea -> 2025 solution.",
    "selftext": "Finally we made something that works great! Hello, and thank you all for so many views and likes and comments under my previous posts. We got 100k views on my 2 previous posts relating to my ideas for solution.\n\nI had the same problem of overheating laptop, even on low CPU usage, so I was trying every market available solution. I already had a cooling pad, that I bought from one platform. But it was so bad, that i put it away to collect dust. Cheap plastic and metal mesh, that went completely broken when i collected the luggage from my arrival flight to Bucharest. A loose USB plug that i never knew if it was on or off. Plus I did not like the idea of something that makes my laptop very unstable, lift by an inch from the surface, make my wrists at strange angles, occupate USB, sound strange, and also not be able to \"push\" my laptop further away from me. So for me a laptop stand would be a huge compromise, that I couldn't accept, and opted out.\n\nThe second wide known option is a \"laptop lifter\" - the stand that lifts laptop off the ground. I did not really try it, but by the looks, it also causes one big problem: It gives an impression of \"Quake\" (i call it a visual concept, a braintrap, where I feel like being inside the Quake game, where you look at the objects at strange angles, and the game Quake and it's 3d engine, is know for strange 3D FOV) - So you need to see your laptop keyboard at unnatural angle which distracts you from work on the computer, plus laptop is also \"lift\" from the table, causing a static gravity object to become somehow \"in air\" and for my brain, it was simply to much to think of trying it out. Plus, you also can't use your touchpad (I use it a lot, i got 4-fingers shortcuts assigned to volume up/down), you need to buy an extra keyboard, etc, etc.\n\nSo what i did, i just simply created \"rails\" that push the notebook further away.\n\nThe problems it solves:\n\n\\- 100% passive cooling\n\n\\- air flows freely, lot of space\n\n\\- very stable\n\n\\- hands lay \"painocomfy\"\n\n\\- moving your hands horizontally, at natural angle on the keyboaard\n\n\\- USB port freed\n\n\\- no \"Quake effect\"\n\n\\- 0 heat onto table\n\n\\- proper sitting position\n\n\\- using my laptop keyboard that i am used to\n\n\\- can attach extra devices on laptop (2 heavy mobile phones on the photo)\n\n\\- a lot of space for books, dinners, \n\n\\- quick attachment/ detachment system\n\n\\- easy to detach, without destroying the surface of the table\n\n\\- and more.\n\nI understand that many of you might be used to keep your table on the wall, but for me it was a choice: \"either i keep smoking my laptop, or i just pull the table away this 10 cm and chill\"\n\nPS: I invented also 3 other new cooling methods, plus 1 cooling system specifically for using laptops in a bed. I already got working prototypes of these three, so stay tuned...\n\nFeel free to ask questions about the \"Laptop on Rails\" viral project and if you think it is cool or do you stand by standard and commercial solutions!",

    "selftext": "Look, I know it's an insanely annoying question nowadays, but I'm just lost at this point. Usually I'd just watch some YouTube vids, talk to ChatGPT, read some reviews, etc., but in this particular case I'm just spending time for seemingly no reason.\n\n**QUITE A LOT OF CONTEXT:**  \nMy current build is B550-F GAMING (WI-FI) motherboard, Ryzen 7 3800X, 32 GB of DDR4 (3600MHz CL16) and RTX 2070 (OG one, non-Super). On top of it, I'm the type who actually enjoys looking at their PC, so aesthetics aren't at the bottom of my priorities.\n\nI play games at 1440p (my main display is Dell S2721DGF, but I've been thinking of eventually moving to either a 1440p Mini LED or a 4K OLED), but I'm not crazy about high FPS. I don't really enjoy 60 FPS anymore, but 75-90 still feels like a nice smooth spot, and anything beyond 120 becomes non-noticeable. That said, I'm a rather casual gamer when it comes to esports titles. The only one I play somewhat regularly is Marvel Rivals, but even then it's just a chill game for me, like I don't care about maxing out my display refresh rate. I do love me some beautiful single player games tho, also the indie stuff + some editing/streaming occasionally (those 8 cores are there for a reason, I swear).\n\n———  \n**NOW that I'm done with this context dump I can finally focus on my upgrade options:**\n\nI originally wanted to just move up to RTX 5060 Ti, but then quickly realized that 5070 (or maybe even 5070 Ti, *if* I'm lucky) would be a way better option for me — because I'm the type of guy who can't convince himself to spend money on xx80/xx90 cards, but also won't upgrade every 2-3 years. Like, I've been sitting here with my 2070 for probably 5-6 years at this point, and now I'm only *thinking* of upgrading my GPU sometime around the start of 2026. Basically, I plan to sit on my new card for a loooong time (DLSS doesn't scare me — same goes for tweaking some settings here and there occasionally).\n\nBut then it hit me that the 3800X probably wouldn't pair that well with a \\~5070, so I started looking into upgrading my CPU, because I didn't want to end up in a situation similar to when long ago I paired new 2070 with a fucking i5-3570 (yup, I know). And **THIS is where I need your help the most.** Where I live, upgrading to AM5 will easily cost me like 1000 USD — something I'd really fucking like to avoid. I know that AM5 is way better than AM4, especially given my habit of upgrading once every \\~5 years, but man... ugh, I don't know.\n\nAnd guess what? Buying a new 5700X will cost only like 130 USD. Shit, even going stupid with a new/used 5700X3D (**which is clearly overpriced nowadays**) will \"only\" cost 370/290 USD.\n\nThe thing is, I want to move past the CPU question first, then focus on the GPU. My mind tells me that just going for 5700X and then selling my old CPU for \\~60 USD is a no-brainer — but maybe I'm wrong. Please, guys, help me out with this one. It feels like I'm going fucking insane.\n\nIf I had enough cash and lived in a stable economy, I'd obviously move to AM5, but in this case it doesn't seem that black-and-white.\n\n———  \nThanks for your time and your input (whatever it'll be, lol) ✨",

From the Asrock B850 apparently straight up FRYING 9800X3D to the B650 not being the best option, I decided to settle on the B840, more specifically the ASUS PRIME B840M-A WIFI AM5 DDR5. I wanted to ask if this is a good motherboard for this combo? Keep in mind that this is primarily a gaming PC, although obviously I do want it to run fast (and also play some emulated games nicely lol). By the way, before people ask about the power difference between the CPU and GPU, I just wanted to pick a strong enough CPU that I may not need to upgrade if I ever want to upgrade the GPU. Thanks!",

It was left kinda hidden underneath my desk and I never bothered to check it. Now it’s having issues and isn’t turning on, so I checked the case and my jaw dropped seeing the amount of dust inside. I didn’t even know I was supposed to do regular maintenance and did a quick research to find out that I should’ve been cleaning it regularly, especially because I smoke at home in the room where the PC is.\n\nI am terrified that by opening and trying to clean the PC I might damage it because I know nothing about it and the situation is so bad I haven’t seen anything like it online. I am considering the fact that I might have to replace some parts unfortunately, but I am hoping someone here can give me some advice on how to clean it and if you have any video recommendations I should follow or tips for my situation.\n\nI am terribly ashamed of the conditions of my PC so I’m kind of scared of asking a professional for help, partly because of how much they might charge me because and partly because I know I’ll be judged hard. I vow to never allow for this to happen again, but rn I urgently need help to save my PC, plz don’t judge me😭",

The general advice is to put the boot/gaming one into slot 1 (CPU, no shared bandwidth). But in my case, I have two drives that will both be active.\n\nI'm leaning towards one of the following two setups:\n\n1. Windows drive (VM) on slot 1, Linux drive (host) on slot 2. While gaming, both will be in use, and any Linux disk activity will share bandwidth with my RTX 5090. *But*, I won't be doing much on Linux simultaneously, so it would mostly just be automatic background activity. Probably not too much of an issue?\n2. Windows drive (VM) on slot 1, Linux drive (host) on slot 3. In this scenario, shared bandwidth is totally avoided. But this would now mean that my primary, main OS boot drive goes through the chipset.\n\nWhat do you think? Thanks.",

As a sidenote, I am planning to fully switch to Linux and I am mostly a single player gamer. I heard that Nvidia is not super great on Linux at the moment but is getting better, and there are promises that DX12 on Linux will be solved in a few months, which I am okay to wait for if the card will be better overall.",

Im building my own pc for the first time, and I was looking at the Ryzen 5 9600x CPU. \n\nI'll be doing a solid bit of gaming, and after several weeks of researching, I'm pretty comfortable with that choice. \n\nMy question is...I'm seeing it currently discounted from its normal price of $279 to $204. Which is an insane discount. However, I know Black Friday/Cyber week is approaching. With the way this CPU has been discounted over the last few months at this price, is it worth purchasing now....or will it be a similar price in a bout a month to possibly cheaper? \n\nI'm still learning some of this and how prices fluctuate, so any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",

Really don't mind playing on medium settings:  \nCyberpunk 2077, Hades 1 & 2, modded Minecraft, Baldur's gate 3 (mostly modded), Honkai Star Rail, lots and lots of the Batman and Lego Batman games, I also own almost all of the resident evil games, RDR2, DMC games, and lots more.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\nI’m finalizing my first gaming PC build and would love your input before pulling the trigger. Goal: story-driven AAA titles at 1440p High/Ultra, 60+ FPS stable in native rendering (no DLSS, Frame Gen, or any AI upscaling — I prefer raw image quality without artifacts).\nFull specs:\n•  CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7600X\n•  Mobo: Gigabyte B650M Aorus Elite AX Ice\n•  RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 32GB (2×16GB) 6000 MHz CL36\n•  GPU: ASUS Prime RTX 5070 OC 12GB GDDR7\nSpecific questions:\n1.  Cyberpunk 2077 (RT Psycho/Ultra if possible): 1440p native High/Ultra — what FPS should I expect? 60+ stable without DLSS/FG? I’ve seen benches with the 5070 doing ~50-70 FPS raster Ultra, but lower with RT — is it playable or do I need to drop to High?\n2.  Clair Obscur: Expedition 33: UE5 turn-based RPG (recommended spec: RTX 3070 for 1080p/60). At 1440p Ultra/Max — easy 60+ FPS native?\n3.  Other story-heavy AAA (Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Starfield, etc.): Overall 1440p High/Ultra native at 60–100+ FPS? Any CPU/GPU bottlenecks?\nThanks for any real-world benchmarks or experiences with similar configs!",

    "selftext": "I'm still relatively new to PC building. I built my first PC back in February of this year and haven't touched or modified its components since. Lately for the past two weeks I've had this issue where when turning on my PC there's a random chance that the middle fan from my Thermalright Frozen Prism 360 Black AIO Water Cooler will fluctuate in speed while making a rather loud noise (kinda sounds like a distant motorcycle speeding if that helps?).\n\nI've found that simply turning my PC off and on again (via windows start or holding down the power button) resolves the issue. I could boot up my PC multiple times without issue and then the next time the fan does its thing again. The fan runs just fine when working properly and has no visible difference in speed or audible difference when compared to the two other fans on the AIO.\n\nDoes anyone know what's going on? Is this a sign that the middle fan is about to die on me?\n\n\n\nOn a side note, if it's recommended that I replace the middle fan on my AIO, I had bought a pack of five 120mm 1550rpm thermalright fans back in February as I didn't know if the case I was buying had fans or not (really poor description and images). It turned out the case did have its own fans so now I just have five 120mm 1550rpm Thermalright fans laying about spare. But my AIO says it's 1850rpm, so although the fans are the same make and size, they're not the same speed. So I don't know if I can use them as replacements?",

    "selftext": "I'm building an entry-level PC for productivity and some 1080p gaming. Here's my current build:\nCPU: Ryzen 5 5600\nMotherboard: B550 with WiFi\nPSU: 550W\nRAM: 2x8GB DDR4\nGPU: RTX 3060 12GB or RX 7600 8GB (undecided!)\nI'm not a heavy gamer—I mostly play Valorant with friends (which runs fine even on potato PCs). I don't do any video editing or heavy workloads. Before anyone judges, this is the best build I can afford right now, and I don't want to buy a used GPU.\nThe main decision is the GPU: Should I go for the RTX 3060 with its extra 4GB VRAM, or the RX 7600 which has more raw performance?  the RX 7600 is about $20-25 cheaper than the RTX 3060.\nI prefer the RTX mainly because of the Nvidia Broadcast app—it helps remove background noise from my mic during online games. I'm not sure if AMD RX cards have a free equivalent software for that.Sorry in advance if this is a dumb question ",

I've been looking at different YouTubers and found Geekawhat, who seems to be good.\n\nHere's the problem: in the past, I bought a PC from 'Elgiganten' and got scammed. They said it was the best PC, but it couldn't even handle unmodded Skyrim. So, spending $2500 on a PC is stressful because I really don't want to pick wrong. I also live in Sweden, so shipping might bring 'TULL' (import taxes), which means I could end up paying much more if I order from uk or outside EU. The uncertainty about taxes is also a big stress factor.\n\nI'm about to spend six years of savings on a new PC, and my main question is: does anyone have advice on where I should look, if what ive found is good or can/should be replaced with other parts.\n\nthe parts/specs that ive looked at are\n\n**CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3Da**\n\n**CPU Cooler: Corsair Nautilus 360 RS ARGB**\n\n**Motherboard: Gigabyte B850 Eagle WiFi6E**\n\n**RAM: Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RGB**\n\n**SSD: Crucial P310**\n\n**GPU: AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT**\n\n**Case: Corsair FRAME 4000D**\n\n**PSU: Corsair RM750e**\n\n**64GB**",

I bought and setup my pc on March this year.

I've tried reseat the ram, reseat the cpu, psu, and even upgrading the bios. Same thing just the red led on the cpu. Then lucky me i managed to claim a waranty for the cpu unit, and got the replacement today.\n\nJust want to let you all know, im not so sure if it was a faulty cpu, or m/b that causing the dead of the cpu, i never did any overclocking, undervolt or anything to the cpu, im just enabling PBO and running bios 3.26 until then. The cpu was running fine and I didnot update the bios (but i did when the first setup). \n\nThere was no any physical damage to cpu nor the m/b, like a burnt mark or any scratches. So as for right now im scared to enable pbo in the bios and will let it run at 4800mhz coz i need this rig for my work. \n\nGiving failed cpu issue on asrock m/b right now like the 9800x3d, make me uneasy and should i replace my motherboard guys? Anyone have the same issue with 9700x? Or maybe any suggestion to make this cpu runs well and last\n\n\n\n",

And despite me formatting and then reinstalling a fresh copy of windows with each attempt, I did not pass the setup screen - bar two times. Somehow, I managed to complete the setup screen and access windows error free. However, after I would log onto windows and enter the homepage, I would get at most 5 minutes within Windows before the screen froze and I got a BSOD. Each time strangely, usually coincided with me stopping movement on my mouse - however even if I remained moving the mouse, the PC would BSOD anyway.\n\nThe error codes I received are listed here ( KERNAL_AUTO_BOOST_LOCK_AQUISITION_WITH_RAISED_IQRL ; MEMORY_MANAGMENT ; VIDEO_DXGKRNL FATAL_ERROR ; IQRL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL ; SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (x3) ; APC_INDEX_MISMATCH ; ATTEMPTED_WRITE_TO_READONLY_MEMORY ; BAD_OBJECT_HEADER ; KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (x2) ; REFERENCE_BY_POINTER ; PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA ; SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED ). \n\nI did some digging online and hypothesised that perhaps my RAM was at fault, so I ran memtest86, twice, only for the results to come back spotless with 0 detected issues. I then tried changing the SATA ports the SSD was connected via, as well as re-seating every component and re-wiring - this also achieved nothing. The only other problems I can think of are either: incorrect BIOS settings for the SSD - which I would be happy to provide SS's of - or that the SSD itself is faulty, which would be an immense pain in Arse. I cannot figure out what the exact problem is as I can find zero helpful resources online, hence my post here - any suggestions?\n\nPC SPECS:\nRYZEN 5 3600\nCrucial Ballistix Sport AT 8GB x2\nZOTAC GAMING GTX 1660Ti 6GB\n(Current working secondary storage: ) Seagate 1 TB Barracuda\nGigabyte B450M DS3H ( BIOS updated to F40, as to be compatible with CPU)\nCorsair VS650\n\nEdit: Worth mentioning build was originally made by me in Dec 2019, and that I have tested using a new M.2 SSD as well as two new sticks of RAM interchangeably.

I’m thinking the most intense game I’ll play is red dead redemption 2 or the forest or something.\n\nI’m also trying to keep this as affordable as possible so some of the things I put on the list may be excessive.\n\nI think this would be a fun experience and skill for me to learn. Thank you!",

    "selftext": "Hello, I am going to basically upgrade my entire pc, i will change the motherboard, cpu, gpu and ram, but i'm going to keep my old ssd. I've heard that if you change your motherboard you have to reinstall Windows using a usb-stick. My coworker told me that if i keep my ssd i won't need to reinstall windows but it may not be activated anymore. My question is, can i just put my old ssd into my new motherboard, boot it up and then reinstall windows or do i have to use a usb-stick?",

    "selftext": "My Maxsun Arc B580 arrived yesterday and I started doing some tests to make sure it is working properly, and so far I have tested it on Crab Champions (mostly while setting up afterburner), Battlefield 2042 and V, Another Crab’s Treasure and Resident Evil 2 remake;\n\nBefore I say the results, will give the context which leads to my question: where I live, we have a week to inspect a product for problems and returning if needed, so for components like a graphic card, I prefer to start testing it straight away to have time to catch any issue. Unfortunately, since I’m upgrading from an older rig (which was built around a GTX 1660), my PSU only has 500W of power, while the ideal for my R7 5700x + B580 would be 600~650W. I knew it would be fine for basic tasks, but gaming seems to be severely impacted, which I hope will be fixed when my Corsair CX650 arrives.\n\nOn BF2042, I had horrendous frame rate, time, and even match loading, worse performance than when I was running the 1660;\n\nOn BF V, It wasn’t so bad, but still ran worse than my old graphic card, and had a bunch of stutter spikes. Tried to underpower the gpu, had mixed results;\n\nOn RE2, it was fine for the first few minutes, was even running the game on nearly maxed settings with a very stable 120fps… that is up until I got to the police station and lag spikes and unstable frame time started to show up;\n\nOn Another Crab’s Treasure, it run just fine on medium settings after limiting the power to 70%, had a few spikes here and there though.\n\nSo, you think this performance problem will be fixed when the new PSU arrives, or did I get a faulty GPU and should return it?\n",

    "selftext": "About 6 years ago I built a Define R7 XL build for gaming. I love the silent feature that Fractal went with where it has vibration dampening, thick panels, etc.  The case weighs a lot but when I'm gaming I only hear the GPU Fan when it cycles to high for a minute or two every 20-30 minutes. I can live with that because any other time you can't hear a single sound from the PC, and if I'm not doing a high GPU process, it never makes sound.\n\nSince then, it seems like cases have gone towards as mesh and vented and open as possible? I understand that better venting means less fan noise because less fan moving... however I am not a fan of the look.. at all. They look really cheap, fake, I don't know how to explain it, but as a previous R5 and R7 Fractal fan, I'm debating if I should jump ship to one of these new cases or try to find another R7 that is now apparently vintage (most sites have it out of stock). I want to pass my current build on to someone else, otherwise I'd re use the case. It's still in flawless condition and I have no complaints aside from the weight.\n\nedit: changed current model (Define R7) name.",

MSI Afterburner shows that games crash as soon as GPU usage reaches 100%. I have tried old and new driver versions to no avail.

I also send the board in for repairs twice now. Both times I got it back as \"tested & working\" but it didn't. So since ASUS doesnt want to help and I need a working PC after \\~10 weeks of this crap, I decided to buy a new board.\n\nThe list of affordable AM5 mini ITX boards is very short. I am not willing to pay more than \\~250€ for this, which leaves me with 8 available boards where I live. I dont see the advantage of getting an A620 Chipset when the cheap B650 variants are basically the same price, this leaves 6 Boards. I have an all Black build so I won't buy the MSI MPG B650I which leaves the following 5:\n\n1. GIGABYTE B650I AX \\[\\~140€\\]\n2. ASRock B650I Lightning WiFi \\[\\~147€\\]\n3.

    "selftext": "I'm building my first proper PC in a long time. I've helped build for some friends some standard systems, but I'm a little less than standard, so I'm looking for any advice . I've been debating for some time on how to build a HTPC, and just a few days sprung on the [FLP01 from SilverStone](https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/flp01/), So I'm building out of this for the time being.\n\n**Hardware:** \n\nI've got an extensive bluray collection, and a collection of PS3 games, So I'm wanting a bluray drive from the supported list of [drives for RPCS3](https://rpcs3.net/quickstart), but also one that supports 4k discs. If possible, 3D blurays would be cool, but I'm unsure what software on PC would support it. I only have maybe a few 3D discs, so It's certainly not a priority or requirement if price difference is large or options unavailable. \n\nI have 4x 24tb HDDs in an external enclosure, which I plan on moving at least 2 to be internal to the system with software raid 1, along with an m.2 boot drive, possibly a second m.2 for a game drive down the line.  \nThe case only has 1 spot for a 3.5 inch drive if I populate the 5.25 bay with a disc drive. I plan on using one or two of these [PCIE HDD Mounting brackets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D92MLS82?psc=1). Would there be any concerns with airflow if I do? What about Drive Vibration? Would there be a better solution?\n\nI have an existing RM 650x power supply from an old build, however if it's recommended to upgrade I will. \n\nMotherboards feel like a mess to shop for. I've found some with an optical audio port, which would be optimal given this will be an HTPC. But that doesn't seem to be something that a lot of online filters account for. Any advice on what sort of motherboard might fit my case would be helpful. \n\nI'm probably figuring I'll get a Ryzen 5 9600X. I'm yet unsure about a GPU. I'm thinking about a 16GB 5060ti, but I know Nvidia isn't as friendly to linux. I figure 32GB of Ram should be perfectly adequate for my use case. Or that I can upgrade later on.\n\n**Software:** I've been learning Linux to get away from windows entirely. I've been using arch on My GPD Win Mini, but I've still got to figure some software solutions to fit both of my goals. I use Heroic Games launcher for GOG, and also steam for some games. I don't have any software decided yet for video playback. VLC has always been my standard choice, but for an HTPC I feel like that doesn't fit. I may try to learn Jellyfin, But I don't know much about it, especially how much work may go in to setting up my collection of shows. Is there a way to show games or support a game library inside it for HeroicGamesLauncher style launching?\n\nWhen I refer to Light VR in the title, I'm mostly thinking Beatsaber, Jet Island, Superhot, maybe Half Life Alyx, No Man's Sky. However I am interested in Metro Awakening",

    "selftext": "I've been using my new build for about a month, and I'm noticing some strange temperature fluctuations with my Ryzen 7 9700X. When testing with OCCT and multiple cores, it reaches at most 64–65 degrees, while in a single-core test it reaches about 76–77 degrees. However, opening a Google Colab notebook can spin up the CPU to 81 degrees. What's even stranger is that these momentary spikes change overnight — for example, one day it was 78, the next day 80–81. At absolute idle, it stays at about 37–38 degrees, with random spikes reaching the mid-40s.  \n  \nIs this normal or something to be concerned about? This CPU is much more powerful than the 5600 I used in my previous build, so I don't really know yet what is considered “normal” for it.\n\nMy motherboard is aorus x870e elite wifi7 and the cooling is Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120. The airflow in my case might not be perfect, because I haven't installed the rear exhaust fan (it's a default fractal design xl with 3 intake fans). Also my ambient temperature is 23-24 degrees",

Here is what is has:\n\n* **Processor (CPU):** AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n* **Graphics Card (GPU):** MSI NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080\n* **Memory (RAM):** 64 GB DDR5 (2 × 32 GB) at \\~4800 MHz.\n* **Storage:** 1 × 4 TB NVMe M.2 SSD.\n* **Motherboard/Chipset:** Based on AMD B650 chipset.\n* **Price:** 3300€\n\nMy problem: it has no info on the RAM / SSD brand.  \nNo Info on the cooler.\n\n**Questions for the connaisseurs:**\n\n* **Value check:** How is this build for the price in Belgium? Any red flags in the parts list?\n* **DIY vs prebuilt:** I’m a “good value for money” type of guy. Would it make more sense to buy the parts individually and build it myself right now?\n* **Custom watercooling (CPU + GPU):** I’ve always wanted to try a full custom loop with hard or soft tube bends.\n   * Is it “easy enough” these days for a careful first-timer?\n\nThanks a lot for any advice! If you think a DIY list would beat the Coolblue price/perf, I’m happy to consider your part lists. 🙏",

    "selftext": "It happen suddenly  on early this month of October 2025, my pc failed to boot. I rarely switch on my pc as this months im quite busy with my job. I bought and setup my pc on March this year. The specs of my pc as follow:\n\n  \nCPU: Ryzen 7 9700x (year 2023) Air-cooled Phantom spirit\n\nM/B: Asrock X870 Steel Legend (on 3.26 bios when it happened)\n\nRam: 32gb XPG Lancer Blade ( 2x 16gb at 6000Mhz)\n\nGPU: Gigabyte RTX 2060 (Needing an upgrade (--) )\n\nPSU: Corsair CV650 650W (upgrade later with gpu maybe)\n\nSo the cpu led just lights up red on the m/b and nothing happen, no boot, just blank screen. I've tried reseat the ram, reseat the cpu, psu, and even upgrading the bios. Same thing just the red led on the cpu. Then lucky me i managed to claim a waranty for the cpu unit, and got the replacement today.\n\nJust want to let you all know, im not so sure if it was a faulty cpu, or m/b that causing the dead of the cpu, i never did any overclocking, undervolt or anything to the cpu, im just enabling PBO and running bios 3.26 until then. The cpu was running fine and I didnot update the bios (but i did when the first setup). \n\nThere was no any physical damage to cpu nor the m/b, like a burnt mark or any scratches. So as for right now im scared to enable pbo in the bios and will let it run at 4800mhz coz i need this rig for my work. \n\nGiving failed cpu issue on asrock m/b right now like the 9800x3d, make me uneasy and should i replace my motherboard guys? Anyone have the same issue with 9700x? Or maybe any suggestion to make this cpu runs well and last\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi, I have a 4.5 year old gaming PC, used mostly for CS2 and some other games. But I am not happy with the performance of CS2 specifically (apparently my CPU is not ideal for CS2). \n\nSpecs:  \nMB: Gigabyte B450 Gaming X (AM4)  \nCPU: Ryzen 7 3700X 8x 3.60 GHz  \nCooler: AMD stock  \nRAM: 16 GB DDR4 3000  \nGPU: GeForce RTX 3060  \nPSU: Enermax 600W  \n\nThe easiest/most obvious upgrade would probably be a 5700x3d, said to be the top choice for AM4 gaming CPU. The problem is that the demand is very high atm, used ones are going for 250+ € and I'd have to order from a random private seller to ship it to me, not sure how I feel about that.    \n\nSo I consider the option to upgrade to AM5. After some research I'm eyeing these parts to upgrade to:  \n\nMB: MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk  \nCPU: Ryzen 7 7800x3d  \nCooler: good air cooler tbd  \nRAM: 32GB DDR5 6000 CL30 EXPO\n\n\nWhile I'm looking at an ~750-800€ investment here, I think it would be a big upgrade, with new parts that will last me longer than a used 5700x3d.   \n\nDoes it make sense to go that upgrade path? What about the GPU, can I just keep using it for now and perhaps upgrade it in 1-2 years if needed? Did I miss anything important that could be a problem here, or will this work? ",

I’m not gaming all the time but I do here and there and want it to be capable. I’m thinking the most intense game I’ll play is red dead redemption 2 or the forest or something.\n\nI’m also trying to keep this as affordable as possible so some of the things I put on the list may be excessive.\n\nI think this would be a fun experience and skill for me to learn. Thank you!",

So I'm not a total noob to PCs, but I'm not knowledgable enough to know if my build is any good, especially since I've been a laptop user for years. \n\nFor the last few years I've actually been gaming on my m3 pro chip Macbook, and I've decided I finally want to take my setup a little more seriously. While I'm satisfied with the performance on it, I just wish I had more variation of what I could play without using wine or a VM. \n\n**Here's my** [**PC part picker list**](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/bhDmwY)**, based on a budget of keeping it under $1500 (hopefully) and the help from some friends.**\n\nI want to do some light streaming/recording and I play/own games like the following already, and hope to play them with at least some good frame rates and graphics. Really don't mind playing on medium settings:  \nCyberpunk 2077, Hades 1 & 2, modded Minecraft, Baldur's gate 3 (mostly modded), Honkai Star Rail, lots and lots of the Batman and Lego Batman games, I also own almost all of the resident evil games, RDR2, DMC games, and lots more. I want to get into Marvel Rivals once I'm free from the shackles of a virtual machine.  \n  \nI really just need some help making sure these parts are good, if anyone has any swap suggestions, or any tips in general I should know for getting into this. \n\nI also have barely any preferences for appearances. It'll be hidden under my desk anyway. I guess I just prefer no RGB. I've got all my peripherals already, and already know what monitor im going to get if I end up getting a second one. \n\nAnyway, thank you, and I will try to reply as soon as possible to any comments :)",

    "selftext": "Look, I know it's an insanely annoying question nowadays, but I'm just lost at this point. Usually I'd just watch some YouTube vids, talk to ChatGPT, read some reviews, etc., but in this particular case I'm just spending time for seemingly no reason.\n\n**QUITE A LOT OF CONTEXT:**  \nMy current build is B550-F GAMING (WI-FI) motherboard, Ryzen 7 3800X, 32 GB of DDR4 (3600MHz CL16) and RTX 2070 (OG one, non-Super). On top of it, I'm the type who actually enjoys looking at their PC, so aesthetics aren't at the bottom of my priorities.\n\nI play games at 1440p (my main display is Dell S2721DGF, but I've been thinking of eventually moving to either a 1440p Mini LED or a 4K OLED), but I'm not crazy about high FPS. I don't really enjoy 60 FPS anymore, but 75-90 still feels like a nice smooth spot, and anything beyond 120 becomes non-noticeable. That said, I'm a rather casual gamer when it comes to esports titles. The only one I play somewhat regularly is Marvel Rivals, but even then it's just a chill game for me, like I don't care about maxing out my display refresh rate. I do love me some beautiful single player games tho, also the indie stuff + some editing/streaming occasionally (those 8 cores are there for a reason, I swear).\n\n———  \n**NOW that I'm done with this context dump I can finally focus on my upgrade options:**\n\nI originally wanted to just move up to RTX 5060 Ti, but then quickly realized that 5070 (or maybe even 5070 Ti, *if* I'm lucky) would be a way better option for me — because I'm the type of guy who can't convince himself to spend money on xx80/xx90 cards, but also won't upgrade every 2-3 years. Like, I've been sitting here with my 2070 for probably 5-6 years at this point, and now I'm only *thinking* of upgrading my GPU sometime around the start of 2026. Basically, I plan to sit on my new card for a loooong time (DLSS doesn't scare me — same goes for tweaking some settings here and there occasionally).\n\nBut then it hit me that the 3800X probably wouldn't pair that well with a \\~5070, so I started looking into upgrading my CPU, because I didn't want to end up in a situation similar to when long ago I paired new 2070 with a fucking i5-3570 (yup, I know). And **THIS is where I need your help the most.** Where I live, upgrading to AM5 will easily cost me like 1000 USD — something I'd really fucking like to avoid. I know that AM5 is way better than AM4, especially given my habit of upgrading once every \\~5 years, but man... ugh, I don't know.\n\nAnd guess what? Buying a new 5700X will cost only like 130 USD. Shit, even going stupid with a new/used 5700X3D (**which is clearly overpriced nowadays**) will \"only\" cost 370/290 USD.\n\nThe thing is, I want to move past the CPU question first, then focus on the GPU. My mind tells me that just going for 5700X and then selling my old CPU for \\~60 USD is a no-brainer — but maybe I'm wrong. Please, guys, help me out with this one. It feels like I'm going fucking insane.\n\nIf I had enough cash and lived in a stable economy, I'd obviously move to AM5, but in this case it doesn't seem that black-and-white.\n\n———  \nThanks for your time and your input (whatever it'll be, lol) ✨",

I've tried reseat the ram, reseat the cpu, psu, and even upgrading the bios. Same thing just the red led on the cpu. Then lucky me i managed to claim a waranty for the cpu unit, and got the replacement today.\n\nJust want to let you all know, im not so sure if it was a faulty cpu, or m/b that causing the dead of the cpu, i never did any overclocking, undervolt or anything to the cpu, im just enabling PBO and running bios 3.26 until then. The cpu was running fine and I didnot update the bios (but i did when the first setup). \n\nThere was no any physical damage to cpu nor the m/b, like a burnt mark or any scratches. So as for right now im scared to enable pbo in the bios and will let it run at 4800mhz coz i need this rig for my work. \n\nGiving failed cpu issue on asrock m/b right now like the 9800x3d, make me uneasy and should i replace my motherboard guys? Anyone have the same issue with 9700x? Or maybe any suggestion to make this cpu runs well and last\n\n\n\n",

The problem is that the demand is very high atm, used ones are going for 250+ € and I'd have to order from a random private seller to ship it to me, not sure how I feel about that.    \n\nSo I consider the option to upgrade to AM5.

What about the GPU, can I just keep using it for now and perhaps upgrade it in 1-2 years if needed? Did I miss anything important that could be a problem here, or will this work? ",

By the way, before people ask about the power difference between the CPU and GPU, I just wanted to pick a strong enough CPU that I may not need to upgrade if I ever want to upgrade the GPU. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Hello.\n\nI'm building a PC with an MSI X870E Carbon Wifi motherboard. The motherboard has the following NVMe slots:\n\n* M.2\\_1 - CPU - PCIe 5.0 x4\n* M.2\\_2 - CPU - PCIe 5.0 x4 - **Shares bandwidth with PCIe slots 1 and 2**\n* M.2\\_3 - Chipset - PCIe 4.0 x4\n* M.2\\_4 - Chipset - PCIe 4.0 x4\n\nI have two NVMe drives: Samsung 990 Pro and WD SN850X:\n\n* Samsung 990 Pro = Main OS boot drive (Linux)\n* WD SN850X = Secondary OS boot drive (Windows gaming)\n\n**Although I can dual boot, most of my gaming will be done using a Windows virtual machine, meaning both Linux and Windows will be running simultaneously, using both drives together.**\n\nWhich slots should I put the drives into? The general advice is to put the boot/gaming one into slot 1 (CPU, no shared bandwidth). But in my case, I have two drives that will both be active.\n\nI'm leaning towards one of the following two setups:\n\n1. Windows drive (VM) on slot 1, Linux drive (host) on slot 2. While gaming, both will be in use, and any Linux disk activity will share bandwidth with my RTX 5090. *But*, I won't be doing much on Linux simultaneously, so it would mostly just be automatic background activity. Probably not too much of an issue?\n2. Windows drive (VM) on slot 1, Linux drive (host) on slot 3. In this scenario, shared bandwidth is totally avoided. But this would now mean that my primary, main OS boot drive goes through the chipset.\n\nWhat do you think? Thanks.",

I’ve seen a few videos and have done research so I know what each part does and a good idea on how I would attach everything together but apart from that I feel like I’m having trouble with compatibility.\n\nI am not really sure what overclocking is and I know people have said that you have to be careful on the GPU you use depending on your CPU bc it can lead it to be inefficient. \n\nI went on the part picker website and have a list but have no clue if it’s good or not. I’ll provide the link, hopefully it works https://pcpartpicker.com/list/LcDmb2\n\nAnyways I want to use my PC for school work and storage of photos and home video as well as some occasional gaming. I’m not gaming all the time but I do here and there and want it to be capable. I’m thinking the most intense game I’ll play is red dead redemption 2 or the forest or something.\n\nI’m also trying to keep this as affordable as possible so some of the things I put on the list may be excessive.\n\nI think this would be a fun experience and skill for me to learn.

Really don't mind playing on medium settings:  \nCyberpunk 2077, Hades 1 & 2, modded Minecraft, Baldur's gate 3 (mostly modded), Honkai Star Rail, lots and lots of the Batman and Lego Batman games, I also own almost all of the resident evil games, RDR2, DMC games, and lots more.

    "selftext": "Seven years ago I had this idea for an underwater PvP survival game. No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it. \n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore.\n\nIt’s been a long road, but this one’s been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "Hi r/PCGaming!\n\nI'm Vince, solo developer of Decimation. Its a sci-fi tower defense game where your towers provide covering fire, but they can't win without you actively fighting with your hero.  \n  \n**What makes it different:**   \nMost tower defense games: Place towers optimally, watch them win. Maybe a hero helps occasionally. In Decimation, if you're not actively using your hero to fight, you lose.   \n  \n**Your hero has:**\n\n* 4 active skills requiring timing and positioning \n* Target-lock system (you choose priority targets, towers can't) \n* Resource collection mid-combat for ultimate ability \n* Meaningful skill expression - button mashing ≠ skillful play\n\nYou can survive by coasting on easier difficulties, but zero-damage perfect runs require execution.  \nThink: TD macro (placement, resources, tower upgrades) + action micro (hero combat with cooldown management, positioning, battle effect usage).\n\n**About the demo:**\n\n* 4 campaign levels (Act 1 complete) \n* 1 boss encounter\n\n*Note: Levels 1-2 teach mechanics.* ***Levels 3-4 + boss are where skill expression really matters.***\n\n**Free to download and play**  \n🎮 Demo Download: [https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation](https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation)  \n  \nThis is a solo passion project. 17 months of development so far. Early Access planned for late 2025 with 3 additional acts for the final game. I'll be around to answer questions about the game, the development process, or anything else.   \n  \nThanks all and sincerely hope to hear from you. Would genuinely love feedback on whether the skill-based approach resonates with TD players.",

    "selftext": "I picked it up yesterday to play with my friends for the first time. I was surprised (in a positive way) at how mechanicaly complex it can be, especially the organizing and reparing the RV part of the game. It seems like the type of game that it's both fun and exciting to master in the long run, BUT I was astonished at how bad it overall works. To the point of taking you out of the immersion multiple times.\n\n\\- This is a physics-based game in which the physics barely work. The rope, the constantly clipping in and out of the RV, the weird collision issues... it's everywhere.\n\n\\- This is a pity, but there's barely a sense of danger or stakes whatosever. From time to time an animal will attack, or there will be a terrain obstacle to overcome, but that's pretty much it. In a way it's cool, this can be a calmer game that, let's say, Peak or REPO. But it also means that in the moment to moment gameplay it can sometimes be somewhat boring, especially because--\n\n\\- This is one of my biggest complaints right now. The multiplayer of this game i feel is not balanced. There were four of us in the RV, and for most of the time, it feels like the game would have worked better with just two. It didn't seem to me like there was much to be done. The person driving has such and advantage mechanically, and there can also be a person looking at the map, but other than that, this is not a Sea of Theves type of thing were EVERY person is needed to manouver the boat. The other two of us were just in the back, seated because you can NOT be walking around the RV while someone's driving because the physics turn crazy. That means it's not a time that you can spend maybe organising the cabinets, playing cards (this is not a mechanic but it would be cool) or something like that.\n\nI want to end on a positive note. Like I said, I really love the premise of the game. It's so unique and full of potential (the chain-smoking is hilarious). If it was well polished and with expanded mechanics, this could be like a land version of Sea of Thieves. But right now is everything but polished. It's so bizarre to me that this is a 1.0 release and not an early access.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe’ve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It’s a fast, chaotic beat ’em up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who’s Mexican, and it’s directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt’s basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It’s been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo’s now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We’ve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that’s part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I’ll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pokémon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it. \n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore.\n\nIt’s been a long road, but this one’s been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe’ve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It’s a fast, chaotic beat ’em up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who’s Mexican, and it’s directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt’s basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It’s been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo’s now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We’ve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that’s part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I’ll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

    "selftext": "Hi r/PCGaming!\n\nI'm Vince, solo developer of Decimation. Its a sci-fi tower defense game where your towers provide covering fire, but they can't win without you actively fighting with your hero.  \n  \n**What makes it different:**   \nMost tower defense games: Place towers optimally, watch them win. Maybe a hero helps occasionally. In Decimation, if you're not actively using your hero to fight, you lose.   \n  \n**Your hero has:**\n\n* 4 active skills requiring timing and positioning \n* Target-lock system (you choose priority targets, towers can't) \n* Resource collection mid-combat for ultimate ability \n* Meaningful skill expression - button mashing ≠ skillful play\n\nYou can survive by coasting on easier difficulties, but zero-damage perfect runs require execution.  \nThink: TD macro (placement, resources, tower upgrades) + action micro (hero combat with cooldown management, positioning, battle effect usage).\n\n**About the demo:**\n\n* 4 campaign levels (Act 1 complete) \n* 1 boss encounter\n\n*Note: Levels 1-2 teach mechanics.* ***Levels 3-4 + boss are where skill expression really matters.***\n\n**Free to download and play**  \n🎮 Demo Download: [https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation](https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation)  \n  \nThis is a solo passion project. 17 months of development so far. Early Access planned for late 2025 with 3 additional acts for the final game. I'll be around to answer questions about the game, the development process, or anything else.   \n  \nThanks all and sincerely hope to hear from you. Would genuinely love feedback on whether the skill-based approach resonates with TD players.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pokémon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

    "selftext": "I picked it up yesterday to play with my friends for the first time. I was surprised (in a positive way) at how mechanicaly complex it can be, especially the organizing and reparing the RV part of the game. It seems like the type of game that it's both fun and exciting to master in the long run, BUT I was astonished at how bad it overall works. To the point of taking you out of the immersion multiple times.\n\n\\- This is a physics-based game in which the physics barely work. The rope, the constantly clipping in and out of the RV, the weird collision issues... it's everywhere.\n\n\\- This is a pity, but there's barely a sense of danger or stakes whatosever. From time to time an animal will attack, or there will be a terrain obstacle to overcome, but that's pretty much it. In a way it's cool, this can be a calmer game that, let's say, Peak or REPO. But it also means that in the moment to moment gameplay it can sometimes be somewhat boring, especially because--\n\n\\- This is one of my biggest complaints right now. The multiplayer of this game i feel is not balanced. There were four of us in the RV, and for most of the time, it feels like the game would have worked better with just two. It didn't seem to me like there was much to be done. The person driving has such and advantage mechanically, and there can also be a person looking at the map, but other than that, this is not a Sea of Theves type of thing were EVERY person is needed to manouver the boat. The other two of us were just in the back, seated because you can NOT be walking around the RV while someone's driving because the physics turn crazy. That means it's not a time that you can spend maybe organising the cabinets, playing cards (this is not a mechanic but it would be cool) or something like that.\n\nI want to end on a positive note. Like I said, I really love the premise of the game. It's so unique and full of potential (the chain-smoking is hilarious). If it was well polished and with expanded mechanics, this could be like a land version of Sea of Thieves. But right now is everything but polished. It's so bizarre to me that this is a 1.0 release and not an early access.",

    "selftext": "Hi! I have a small question. I've had a PC for a couple of years with an i9-11980HK (an Erying motherboard with a soldered laptop CPU), a 650W Corsair power supply, 32GB of RAM, and a nice Thermalright cooler. Over time, I’ve made some upgrades like adding more storage, a new case, and extra fans. The latest upgrade was finally getting an FHD monitor after years of using a terrible old LCD one.\n\nThe thing is, I want to upgrade my GPU since the integrated one obviously isn’t enough. I’m torn between the RX 9060 XT 8GB and the 16GB version. Unfortunately, here in Mexico there’s quite a price difference between the two. If I went for the 16GB, I’d probably have to wait another 6–8 months, but honestly, I already need it. (The 8gb one its aprox $433.25 and the 16gb $539.72)\n\nFor context: I mainly use my PC for game development since I’m an indie dev (buy *File 47* on Steam, haha). I plan to work with Unity 6, but I don’t make super demanding games—just good-looking ones that are well optimized. I’d also like to be able to casually play things like *Minecraft*, *Fortnite*, *Warzone*, or a few AAA titles I have on Steam. I don’t play much on PC since I already have a PS5 Slim for that.\n\nAll of this is for my 1080p 240Hz monitor.  \nWhat do you recommend, wise Reddit users?  \nThanks for your time 🗿",

After that I tried restarting the PC into bios, which cause the screen to freeze on the advanced boot up screen, so I turned the PC off and It caused the black screen to come back and so I tried resetting CMOS again and this time. It didn't work, I tried re seating the RAM, GPU and checking all connections, which after trying to turn it on again caused the screen you see in the post to show during boot, and well.. I can't seem to get past it I tried getting into bios but that didn't seem to work although I'm not sure if It's just my keyboard cuz it doesn't have a delete key and instead I have to press function and then backspace which isn't always consistent.

I had it built by a friend 3 years ago, but then we had a bad fight and stopped talking to each other and have no other PC expert friends :(\n\nI’ll be completely honest… I have been a terrible owner and very irresponsible and have never cleaned my PC. It was left kinda hidden underneath my desk and I never bothered to check it. Now it’s having issues and isn’t turning on, so I checked the case and my jaw dropped seeing the amount of dust inside. I didn’t even know I was supposed to do regular maintenance and did a quick research to find out that I should’ve been cleaning it regularly, especially because I smoke at home in the room where the PC is.\n\nI am terrified that by opening and trying to clean the PC I might damage it because I know nothing about it and the situation is so bad I haven’t seen anything like it online. I am considering the fact that I might have to replace some parts unfortunately, but I am hoping someone here can give me some advice on how to clean it and if you have any video recommendations I should follow or tips for my situation.\n\nI am terribly ashamed of the conditions of my PC so I’m kind of scared of asking a professional for help, partly because of how much they might charge me because and partly because I know I’ll be judged hard. I vow to never allow for this to happen again, but rn I urgently need help to save my PC, plz don’t judge me😭",

I know PS5 doesn’t natively support ultra-wide(thats the main reason I build a PC😭). Few games in PS5 supports Ultrawide resolution(particularly Director’s Cut Editions). I am playing Death Stranding in PS5, the Ultrawide option is something like in the image. Normally there will be only black bar in the sides as in the second image, but with this option the game renders in way that i need to zoom to get the full screen.\n\nNow I want to know is there a way to make the output as Zoom to Fill the screen? Does anyone came across this scenario and tried out anything new?\n\nI am thinking to give a DDC code directly to Monitor for controlling a hidden function, I have not explored the available VCP codes for my monitor yet. But I fear this could do an irreversible damage to my monitor. Is it okay to check this way?\n\nNote: There is a in built option from MSI OSD to force use 21:9 ratio but it only stretches the screen. \n",

But it still costs 900€ new and 650€+ on the used market.\n\nThen there is the 5070ti. Only 16GB, the minimum that’s acceptable. However it’s slightly faster than the 7900XTX in gaming already, but when it comes to Blender it just buries the 7900XTX. The 5070ti has a score of 7600 - 3300 points more than the 7900XTX.\nAll that brand new for 700€.\n\nAs much as I want to buy team red again, it’s hard to justify that with these kind of differences and leaning into productivity over gaming.\n\nDid I miss any GPUs which could be interesting?\n\nAre there 5070ti models with traditional 8pins?\n\nIf not, which models have Load balancers ?\n\nI built in a Hyte Revolt 3 with an SF-1000L, which causes the PSU cables to … beeeend. That’s probably an issue, right ? How can I avoid that ?\n\n",

The PC recognises the monitor in settings but always says no signal on the monitor, unless I change the monitors resolution in NVIDIA control panel to 1080i rather than 1080p, in which cases I get a blurry and jittery image which blacks out periodically. Anyone know what the issue is likely to be? I suspect I need a better cable but wanted to check before I paid more for one.\n\nSo far I have tried:  \n\\- unplugging pc and or monitor for 1+ minutes and then reconnecting  \n\\- windows + ctrl + shift + b to reset graphics  \n\\- messing with windows P  \n\\- plugging the monitor straight into my hdmi port: works but the monitor already in hdmi doesn't work plugged into the DP",

I currently only have screenshots of Battlefield 6, as it's the only game with such graphics that I have installed, but this happens also on BO6, on Spider-man 1 and 2, Horizon, God of War, on pretty much every game with this sort of graphical style.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kf6mawutwvxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ef047fc64f13ec7ee4362c5c205dbb9bc6173a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3rawezutwvxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=81ac1df9b0b780b53bfadb4b674cd50df374cd0b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyd34zutwvxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fc7cab646bb7df2140407aaadad12d2aa7c5cda\n\nYou'll notice that it's almost like the game has no antialiasing at all (despite always having antialiasing on, NOT upscaling or render resolution shenanigans); Stuff in the background looks weirdly blurry, stuff up close looks weirdly pixelated; Depth of field effects have almost an aura around them that looks strange (you'll can easily see this around the scope in the second image), even weird artifacting in some places.\n\nI am on an RX 6600, Ryzen 5 5600, 32GB of 3200mhz RAM, no overclocking, updated drivers, etc... I did switch from a NVidia GPU to the RX 6600, but I used DDU to uninstall the drivers beforehand. The only weirdness in my setup is that I'm still using a 1600x900 monitor, but I don't think that would mess up the games this much.\n\nAny idea what this could be? I haven't formatted my PC in at least like 6 or 7 years and I'm still on Windows 10, having switched some parts in the meantime. At this point I'm thinking maybe I'll just fully format it and hope for something to magically fix this?",

    "selftext": "Can someone help me understand why Windows 11 is disliked so much by Windows 10 users? I use both Mac and PC and tinker with Linux distros so I know the importance of a clean well functioning OS. I’ve used NTlite on several versions of windows in past. A die hard win2000, xp and 7 user  cause Win8 was true garbage. But  Win11?  Whats so bad about it? I install from Microsoft's own ISO so there is very little bloatware. Sure a few net apps are installed but not a too big of deal and there is a powershell command to automate all of its removal if you want. It was much worse in past versions. I use OOSU10  to quickly disable telemetry co-pilot. Use a local account and bypass tricks still work and avoid MS apps like Office, Edge and install open source apps like OnlyOffice, ProtonMail for mail calendar and contacts, Firefox and Joplin for notes. PowerToys brings many features Mac users enjoy like power rename, text extractor, command palette and peek. My custom PC hardly crashes, not more than my Mac Mini and my Windows is full of stuff from Adobe and Autodesk.  I also delay feature updates in group policy for 1 year so no surprise updates that break my computer. I think one reason why I might like Win11 is because its become more like macOS and that's a fair complaint if you are not used to macOS. Now the day they force co-pilot on every user with zero option to remove/disable it, then I can see that being a reason. And if its speed, well macOS upgrades slow down macs also. By a lot. My specs are a 9950x and 4090RTX so maybe i dont see speed issues like some?\n\nso does it really boil down to they don't have fast enough hardware to upgrade which is common with both win and mac  or they hate the macOS similarities?\n\nSince this is PCMR, ill share my new mechanical keyboard that I found much better in terms of build quality, customization and typing speed than my touch ID apple keyboard.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/iwVhc0B.jpeg",

It only does this on battlefield so far.\n\n**A few more details:**\n\n* We’re both on wifi have tried one on 2.4g and one on 5g and both on same band zero difference.\n* We’ve confirmed that our devices are getting different local IP addresses.\n* If I switch one of us back to Starlink (so we’re on separate ISP/router), we can both join the game together with no problems.\n* If we *both* use Starlink, there’s no issue either.\n* The connection itself (speed, ping, etc.) on fiber is great otherwise.\n\nThis makes me think it’s something about the new router or the way the ISP handles connections?

I wanted to upgrade to something wireless and a bit more “premium,” so I picked up the G502 X Lightspeed for €85.\n\nUnfortunately, I really didn’t like it. \n\n• The scroll wheel feels super cheap, makes a lot of noise, and wobbles more than I expected. \n\n• The buttons also feel kind of cheap and too loud. Not what I was hoping for at this price.\n\nI’m planning to return it and was thinking of getting the G305 for €50, since I heard it’s pretty similar to the G203 (which would be fine by me).\n\nThat said, I’m open to suggestions! I’m looking for a wireless mouse that’s great for both gaming and general use.\n\nHere’s what matters most to me: \n\n• Good Wireless connection \n\n• Premium-feeling buttons \n\n• Ergonomics / comfort\n\nThings I liked about the G502 X: \n\n• The shape (I liked the right-hand ergonomic design) \n\n• The many buttons (not a must) \n\n• The free-spinning scroll wheel \n\n• The USB receiver compartment under the mouse\n\nThings I didn’t like: \n\n• Cheap-feeling, loud buttons \n\n• No lights (not a must, but it’s nice to have)\n\nI’d love to try something with a right-hand ergonomic shape like the G502, or even one of those lightweight honeycomb (“bee hive”) designs. But I’m also perfectly fine sticking to something simple like the G203. I really like the looks of the Glorious Model O 2 mini, but it costs €90 and I don’t really know if it’s worth it and how the button feel. Also, I’ve read some bad reviews, and I’ve never heard of the brand.\n\nAny suggestions for a wireless mouse with good build quality and satisfying clicks?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "title": "Thermalright AIO middle fan on PC start up randomly has a chance to fluctuate in speed while making a loud noise",
    "selftext": "I'm still relatively new to PC building having built my first PC back in February of this year and I haven't touched or modified its components since. Lately for the past two weeks I've had this issue where when turning on my PC there's a random chance that the middle fan from my Thermalright Frozen Prism 360 Black AIO Water Cooler will fluctuate in speed while making a rather loud noise (kinda sounds like a distant motorcycle speeding if that helps?).\n\nI've found that simply turning my PC off and on again (via windows start or holding down the power button) resolves the issue. I could boot up my PC multiple times without issue and then the next time the fan does its thing again. The fan runs just fine when working properly and has no visible difference in speed or audible difference when compared to the two other fans on the AIO.\n\nDoes anyone know what's going on? Is this a sign that the middle fan is about to die on me?\n\n\n\nOn a side note, if it's recommended that I replace the middle fan on my AIO, I had bought a pack of five 120mm 1550rpm thermalright fans back in February as I didn't know if the case I was buying had fans or not (really poor description and images). It turned out the case did have its own fans so now I just have five 120mm 1550rpm Thermalright fans laying about spare. But my AIO says it's 1850rpm, so although the fans are the same make and size, they're not the same speed. So I don't know if I can use them as replacements?",

    "selftext": "This question has been asked a million times but it seems every thread I find on it, either doesn’t really go into detail, shows a bit too much bias, or skews representation to point towards one or the other (guess this is also bias truthfully) and I’d like to hear some straightforward, no-bullshit input from others that don’t care to lean towards either side inherently. \n\nI grew up on Intel. If I can even recall, the first PC I “built” out of spare parts had some kind of Celeron in it, then next system had a Core 2 Duo, then a Core 2 Quad system, then in 2014 I built one with a Core i3-3250 and thought I was on top of the world lol. \n\nThe last 5 or so years I’ve stuck to AMD because they simply made more sense every time I went shopping for processors, and again I really don’t care whose name is on it. As of right now I’m rocking a Ryzen 9-9900X.\n\nLooking at Intel’s current lineup after not having one for a while or even being in-tune with them, they don’t seem to make bad performers, and the old “power hog” concern they had a couple years back compared to AMD doesn’t seem to be there, at least not comparing something like the Ryzen 9 lineup to a Core 9 Ultra (170W vs 125W in the specific comparison I was looking at, 9-9900X vs 285K). They also sport far more cores on average at each level of their lineup, although lacking hyper threading and not being insane over AMD in multi-core performance, so who’s really to say that means a ton. \n\nUltimately, are there scenarios where an Intel CPU would objectively make sense over its AMD counterpart? Something I’ve been wondering over the past few months and haven’t found a direct yes or no on.",

I can run windows, browsers and other apps just fine. I tried FurMark and OCCT to stress test my system, but there is no errors (?), even on max usage. It seems to only crash in 3D games. I haven't noticed any artifacting, it only seems to black screen or on occasion it does a purple screen. Sometimes the game just crashes, and sometimes the black screen stays and I just have to Force Shutdown.\n\nNow im hella confused.\n\nSo I borrowed my sister's GTX 1050 from her computer and swapped it with the current one, and it's fixed, no more crashing. (Ws)\n\nThen it's not a software issue, it's a hardware issue with my GTX 1050. But then how come there's no artifacting? Or when I stress tested it, there were no issues with the GPU, VRAM, RAM, CPU, or just anything in general. It only crashes in games??\n\nIm having a hunch my GTX 1050 is short circuiting since it's dusty and all??\n\nAny ideas to what is going on is appreciated. Pls help.",

    "selftext": "I just updated my graphics driver and out of curiosity if it would improve some minor issues I've been having, I let it do a \"clean\" install. In that process the install turned off HDR (which I had enabled through the NVIDA control panel a couple years ago and even prior to upgrading to win11 and hadn't touched since) and the control panel then told me to go through windows settings to re-enable. However windows is now telling me my display is not HDR compatible? My setup hasn't changed or moved in the past 3 years. Same display/cable. I can see no obvious reason as to why it shouldn't be compatible anymore unless the requirements have somehow changed.   \nMy friend circle has been vehemently anti-HDR for their own setups, but on my end it actually improved the quality by a LOT, to the point where I am now squinting at my screen because my eyes feel personally offended, lol.  \nDoes anyone have any idea as to what could have changed / how to fix this or alternative solutions? Any ideas are appreciated!",

Now I know much more about PC’s my knowledge has expanded significantly but I still could learn more. Now that I’m 18 life is leading me to decide what career path I’m going to head down for the past 4 years I’ve been confident I want to be a Mechanical Engineer due to when I was younger would watch hacksmith a YouTuber who’s and mechanical engineer he would build cool gadgets and what not I have always been fascinated with how things are built, function, and just the overall ideal of creation and creating things also I like to be hands on if I were to do such work. But of lately I came to the realization I fell in love with PC building and was curious are their any careers that pay relatively good for PC design or building?

For example:\n\n“Test X” shows how powerful the CPU is in gaming,\n\n“Test Y” measures performance in multitasking, etc.\n\n\nThese are the categories listed on the site:\n\n1 Core (Average single-core speed)\n\n2 Core (Average dual-core speed)\n\n4 Core (Average quad-core speed)\n\n8 Core (Average octa-core speed)\n\n64 Core (OC multicore speed)\n\n64 Core (Average multicore speed)\n\n\nCan someone explain what each of these actually means and how they translate into real-world use cases?",

    "selftext": "Whenever I boot my PC it usually boots on a black screen not letting me do anything, I have to turn it off and on at the wall until it eventually decides to work which has taken anywhere from the second try to 2 hours of my life. Occasionally when I turn it on it goes to autorepair although when this issue started it said start up windows 11 when it should've said windows 10. It often crashes mid startup or randomly, I think its when the PC is doing something intensive that causes it but im honestly not sure cuz sometimes that's definitely not the case, its just more often that it happens that way. Additionally sometimes the screen also flickers before turning off. I've tried pretty much everything except a factory reset and ive got no clue what to do anymore",

    "title": "Why did Intel ditch their Core i branding?",
    "selftext": "Intel had been going very strong for 14 generations with their core i9/i7/i5/i3 branding, but why did they decide to replace it with Core Ultra? Makes no sense to me, sure they had a few hiccups with the 13th and 14th gen with overheating but Core Ultra is just a really unappealing naming scheme to me. Maybe it would have been a better transition if they didn't confusingly release the first desktop processors on the second generation, and also have a completely different line of processors simply called \"Intel Core\" on the side? Really makes me want to go with AMD for my next processor because of their good reputation and a naming scheme that makes sense.",

After that I tried restarting the PC into bios, which cause the screen to freeze on the advanced boot up screen, so I turned the PC off and It caused the black screen to come back and so I tried resetting CMOS again and this time. It didn't work, I tried re seating the RAM, GPU and checking all connections, which after trying to turn it on again caused the screen you see in the post to show during boot, and well.. I can't seem to get past it I tried getting into bios but that didn't seem to work although I'm not sure if It's just my keyboard cuz it doesn't have a delete key and instead I have to press function and then backspace which isn't always consistent.

The remaining 17.76% users either have a videocard other than these, or the cards were not specifically registered in the survey.\n* Each histogram bin represents a 2000 G3D mark, starting from 0-2000 for the first bin, up to 38000-40000 for the last bin, making a total of 20 bars.\n* Most popular high-end card is **RTX 4070** at **2.16%.**\n* Most popular mid-range card are **RTX 3060** at **4.41%** and **RTX 4060 Laptop** at **4.84%**\n* Most popular low-end card are **GTX 1650** at **3.02%** and **RTX 3050** at **3.07%**\n* Most popular potato card is **GTX 1050** at **0.71%**.\n\nEDIT: 5070 and RX 580 are repeated twice. They both should only be in the higher bin. RTX 3090 Ti & 9070 XT were not recognised in Steam surveys and were most likely put in the 17.76% generic/other cards.\n\nEDIT2: The grouping is arbitrary. There is no agreed definiton on low/mid/high. Don't beat yourself up over it.",

Makes no sense to me, sure they had a few hiccups with the 13th and 14th gen with overheating but Core Ultra is just a really unappealing naming scheme to me. Maybe it would have been a better transition if they didn't confusingly release the first desktop processors on the second generation, and also have a completely different line of processors simply called \"Intel Core\" on the side? Really makes me want to go with AMD for my next processor because of their good reputation and a naming scheme that makes sense.",

    "selftext": "Review time!\n\nModel: XVX MU68 FujiWave Theme Mechanical Keyboard | XVX/WORMIER\n\nPrice: $100 USD (20% discount for the week of Halloween)\n\nSize: 65%, 68 keys\n\nKeycaps: MOA profile, PBT\n\nHot Swappable?: Yes, switches are pre-lubed & linear I think\n\nGasket Mount: Yes, but there really isn't any flex?\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\n[https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard](https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: no, I didn't get this for free, but they did give me the 20% discount for Halloween after I purchased the keyboard because I was a couple days early for the discount and they said that a reddit review would be very helpful to them and I thought \"wow, that's a great idea. Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

I've paired the build with a purple and green Owlab Voice Mini, and MW Fright Night deskmat. \n\nThere's nothing better than combining multiple multiple purchases into one solid theme.

If you have any tips then on plate materials for a thocker sound would help and other suggestions for the sound.\n\nSpecs\nMagegee star75 PCB\nGateron Milky Yellows Hand Lubed (forgot the version but I think it's the newest ones.)\nSA KBDIY Monster Clone Keykaps 14mm height.\n",

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks — band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast 🙂.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me — in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn’t make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they’ll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly — The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay’s voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away → Roxette**  \nI’m still in love with Marie Fredriksson’s voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 → Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele — the man, the music, the attitude — pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F → Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The “3” also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit — Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 → 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it’s probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive →** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt’s pure freedom, soul, happiness — life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins… and hopefully Bart’s story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy — build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power → N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote “tuurnn” next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in — just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane →** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane — the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations →** had to be here anyway, but this one’s a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song’s energy, Mark’s wild teenage years, his early work — all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we’re at it…\n\n**P.I.J M.M → Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite — the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE → Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come Through* would’ve been too many “dreams” — and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire → Scooter (HP Baxxter’s voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in Pécs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously — the best element!\n\n**Out of Space → The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under “Space”, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune’s “I was sent to outer space,” and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can’t Stop Raving* didn’t fit anymore 😅.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True →** basically the slogan of the ’90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven’t outgrown it — and honestly, “growing up” was never my strong suit 🙂.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? →** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I’ve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here — sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** — doesn’t need explaining, but I shouldn’t forget it either.\n* **NRG** — same energy.\n* **Music** — the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** — cliché, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** — probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** — took a while to find. Wanted something that says “I don’t fit in boxes,” kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** — because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** — as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** — one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny “-drive,” because if it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn’t stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches… the works.\n\nThat’s about all that fit — for now.  \nI’ve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer — brush smears the paint, and I don’t want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway… I’ve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the ***Logitech G915 TKL*** and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the *G515* with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the ***Keychron K1 Max*** with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using [launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/) but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use [usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

Big win for us all!\n\nI'm a big fan of marbley sounds and the Hi75 is the perfect model for this. Even stock, this thing sounded great.\nI tried HMX Canglan switches on this board, which sounded great but had a more muted and thocky sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the MMD Princesses which had a slightly higher-pitched sound, which I think really helps with the marbley sound as opposed to a more deep and flat sound. I was inspired by sound tests like [this one with MMD Princesses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2iPPrgfkIo) and [this one with Epomaker Jade Blossoms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9EoDIbE9OU) which sound basically perfect to me. The former is more like what my build sounds like IRL so I'm over the moon with the sound, but I still have Jade Blossoms on the way to see what they sound like as well.\n\nI'm also pleasantly surprised by these Osume keycaps. Not only do I like the non-standard legends and gradient colors from top to bottom, the packaging itself was very thoughtful (all rows separated in different trays, and individual places in the trays labeled, as opposed to all keycaps in one enormous tray with no labeling to help). And of course as a Taiwanese guy, I loved these novelties and had to spring for those as well. :)\n\nOverall this is the most perfect build I've ever made and I'm so happy with what the market looks like in 2025.",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Found bigger silicone bumpons that dont sink into deskpads completely, fixing “thudding”. input parts number 107091 into [Here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/), order a reasonable amount and should deliver it to you for free\n\n\nNowadays I’ve been noticing that some keyboards like the Frog Mini and some if the newer Neo boards having issues with how it sounds. This is mostly due to those keyboards having pretty short feet leading to the bottom of the keyboard to touch your deskpad as it compresses due to the weight of the keyboard which causes it to “thud”. \n\nI’ve had issues with this in the past since I use a XSoft mousepad from LethalGamingGear. When i put my keyboard on my mousepad it at first sounds fine, but as the keyboard starts to sink down due to its weight, i start to hear vibrations and “thudding” from the desk.\n\nWhile building a drawer from ikea, i noticed that it came with some silicone bumpons to reduce the noise from the contact of the wood. And now compared to the normal hemisphere silicone bumpons that keyboards usually come with, these are a bit bigger. So I thought to try them on a keyboard that is thudding, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, tall enough so that the bottom does not touch my mousepad. I did some searching to see where i can find more of these and lo and behold, ikea actually gives them for free. Simply go to the [IKEA spare parts](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/) website and input part number 107091 and it should show up. Each one comes in a pack of 2 so as long as you order a reasonable amount, they should give them to you for free delivered straight to you.\n\nEDIT: Size for comparison. Smaller original feet are from a JJW Moment https://imgur.com/a/T48CUmH",

    "selftext": "Built it up three times, because I mixed up some things, but it is finally ready :-). All keys are working, only one caveat: the upper left LED is not blinking, but I am not a LED guy and its switched off any way (been using Das Keyboard Ultimate with unlabeled keys for years). Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

    "title": "[RULES UPDATE] Media Only Post, Typing Apps, Games, and Extensions, Combatting Spam",
    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "selftext": "Review time!\n\nModel: XVX MU68 FujiWave Theme Mechanical Keyboard | XVX/WORMIER\n\nPrice: $100 USD (20% discount for the week of Halloween)\n\nSize: 65%, 68 keys\n\nKeycaps: MOA profile, PBT\n\nHot Swappable?: Yes, switches are pre-lubed & linear I think\n\nGasket Mount: Yes, but there really isn't any flex?\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\n[https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard](https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: no, I didn't get this for free, but they did give me the 20% discount for Halloween after I purchased the keyboard because I was a couple days early for the discount and they said that a reddit review would be very helpful to them and I thought \"wow, that's a great idea. Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

    "selftext": "https://reddit.com/link/1ohqnll/video/3yg1upjhypxf1/player\n\nI made my first switch customization to my ZSA Moonlander Mark 1, and I love it. I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

    "selftext": "Review time!\n\nModel: XVX MU68 FujiWave Theme Mechanical Keyboard | XVX/WORMIER\n\nPrice: $100 USD (20% discount for the week of Halloween)\n\nSize: 65%, 68 keys\n\nKeycaps: MOA profile, PBT\n\nHot Swappable?: Yes, switches are pre-lubed & linear I think\n\nGasket Mount: Yes, but there really isn't any flex?\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\n[https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard](https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: no, I didn't get this for free, but they did give me the 20% discount for Halloween after I purchased the keyboard because I was a couple days early for the discount and they said that a reddit review would be very helpful to them and I thought \"wow, that's a great idea. Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

Maximum budget is £1K. \nNot fussed about super high refresh rates but 120Hz ideally for console gaming in the future (or whenever GTA VI ever releases!). 100% sRGB colour accuracy would be good too. I rarely print my work so AdobeRGB isn’t a priority but good to have. \nDo I go for 5K IPS 27” monitor with the BenQ or 4K WOLED 32” with the LG?\nAny insight and advice would be appreciated! ",

That’s why I didn’t aim for a mini-led but rarher for an IPS (I don’t think HDR is for me).\n\nI’m also obsessed with longevity so I’ll maybe get an OLED later as a second screen but not right now.\n\nRight now my laptop has a rtx 4080 but I may build a new PC if needed.\n\nBudget isn’t a problem but space is so I’m aiming for a 27\".\n\nWhich bring me to today with a sale on both the KTC H27P6 (299€) and the H27E6 (265€) wich both have good reviews on DisplayNinja.\n\nWhich monitor would you recommend ? (I don’t mind if you recommend other monitors but prices tend to be on the high end in France which make other model’s value not that good)\n\nThanks a lot for your help, I still have a lot to learn so I may be off the mark (I hope not !)",

    "selftext": "Good Day\n\nI am going to be upgrading my monitors soon, I mostly do stocks, accounting and excel work with some light photography (I dont play games on this work cpu). My monitor setup is a 3 monitor in a H setup (two monitors on the right in verticle and the center main is horizontal). My graphics card is a AMD RAdeon Pro W7500, and a AMD 9900x cpu. I typically sit around 4-5ft away from my screens being I have good eye sight (no zoom/scaling, I like to use around 10pt fonts in excel and 12pt fonts in my broswer)\n\nMy current planned upgrade of my main montior from a Asus ProArt 2.5k 27\" 16:9 (2560x1440) to a Benq 4k RD280U for the extra height space of a 3:2 monitor and less intense brightness due to the programming mode. \n\nWhat I need help is on my other two monitors. Which is a Asus ProArt 16:10 24\" 1920x1200 in verticle mode. I can for sure see the pixel difference between the 2560x1440 and the 1920x1200. \n\nBut I am having mixed feelings on if I should upgrade to a 4k or a 2.5k monitor. If it was 2.5k then ill prob do a Benq SW242Q or another 27\" 2.5k Proart. If I do 4k then all my monitors is 4k but then ill have to bump up to a 4k and all of those start at 27\" min (either Benq or Asus photogarphy monitors) but 27\" takes up a lot of height space being all of those are 16:9 hence my hestancy of 27\" monitors. Another RD280U 3:2 is pretty much a 27\" with more height so that dont solve that problem (though I can just not do the verticle layout in that case)\n\n\nAny suggetions or advice?\n\nEdit: gah typo for title Size -> Side.",

The only replacement I can find costs way more than I’d like to spend (already 40 Euros per monitor without monitor arms), especially for what’s basically a small metal bracket.\n\nHas anyone here found a good alternative, or built a DIY version that works well?\n\nThe mounting holes on the back are oddly spaced at roughly 25 × 29 cm. My current \"best\"idea is to use four 40 mm M6 male-to-female standoffs screwed into the back, then attach universal VESA extensions on top to line up with a standard 100 × 100 mount.\n\nAny tips, measurements, or photos from people who’ve tried this would be really appreciated!",

Mostly just for work (documents, email etc.) with some very occasional gaming.\n\nI use a dual computer setup: laptop for work, desktop for personal use. Laptop has a thunderbolt port. Desktop has a usb 3.1 port. \n\nMy current set up is dual dell 24’ p2422h monitors (funded by my work a handful of years ago). I connect up to my laptop with hdmi ports and my pc separately. Have a usb switch for peripherals.\n\nLooking to replace with 27’ monitors with a monitor arm and willing to spend a bit if it means a nicer experience given how much of my life I spend in here. Would be great to have a clean set up so I am somewhat interested in KVM built in, daisy chaining, etc. Thinking 4K monitors. \n\n1. The Dell U2725QE caught my eye—was considering perhaps one of those and then perhaps a second 27’ that is a bit cheaper. But I’ve seen a lot of complaints about coil whine and it does sound like it is bad for gaming (although honestly I’ve been fine on my current monitors so I can’t imagine this is a big issue).\n\n2. Recently came across the ASUS pro art PA27UCGE. Also pricy and I know it is mostly for colour-correct necessities like photo editing and video editing, but does seem to be very good all around. Perhaps one of these and then a second 27’ that is a bit lower end?\n\nWelcoming thoughts and advice! ",

I'm currently on a 27inch 1440p Odyssey G5 G50D (IPS) and I've been thinking, maybe I should've gotten either of the 32 inch variants instead (VA/IPS)? It just feels like it'd be more immersive for gaming with an even bigger screen?\n\nDo you have any experience with this monitor specs combination? Is the PPI too low? Are there any *good* models with this rez/size setup, or are they all afterthoughts that nobody's buying?",

I am looking for the best possible experience at the 27-inch / 1440p (2K) sweet spot.\nMy Requirements:\n1. Budget: Max €500 (Buying in Italy/EU, so EU pricing applies).\n2. Size & Resolution: 27 inches and 1440p (2560x1440).\n3. Refresh Rate: Between 144 Hz and 180 Hz.\n4. Priority: Best possible image quality (color accuracy, contrast) and overall performance for gaming. I want a smooth, crisp image.\nMy Current Setup & Context:\n• PC Specs: NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti 16GB and Intel i5-13400F.\n• Gaming Goal: I primarily play AAA titles and want to hit Ultra settings with 60+ FPS (which is why I'm focusing on 1440p).\n• Previous Experience: I have been using a large 4K TV at 60 Hz as a monitor. When I tried to play games at 2K resolution on the 4K TV, the image was often blurry (\"blurry\" or \"muddy\") or seemed to have visible pixels/aliasing when sitting close.\n• Viewing Distance: I sit at arm's length from the screen. I need the image to look sharp and clean at this distance.\nI am looking for recommendations for specific models (preferably IPS or Mini LED for color) that offer the best panel quality, color gamut, and response time within the €500 limit.\nThank you in advance for your help!",

Currently using 1440p. I have 3 total monitors all 1440p but my work is 4k capture \n* Refresh rate: High refresh (144Hz+ ideally)\n* Budget: Try to stay under **$1200** (USD) if possible.\n* Good color accuracy for photo work (sRGB/AdobeRGB or whatever you guys think is “good enough” for photography + gaming).\n* Flat preferred but curved is fine if the size/resolution/refresh trade-offs make sense tbh \n\nOverall, Im thinking I should steer away from OLED because of the risk of burn in tbh but I would still like a high quality looking monitor.   \nIs 4k gaming really worth it or should I just stick to 1440p?\n\nAny help/suggestions is greatly apperciated, thank you :)\n\n",

They weren’t there before — I came back from vacation and suddenly they appeared.\n\t•\tThe spots are not perfectly square, more like round shadows.\n\t•\tIf I look closely, I can see the individual pixels underneath.\n\t•\tSo far, three spots have appeared, and they seem to spread over time.\n\t•\tI tried a stuck pixel fixer video for 15 minutes, but nothing changed.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? Could this be liquid/damage inside the panel, or is there any chance they might disappear on their own?\n\nThanks for any advice! 🙏\n",

MSI is just a tiny bit cheaper. I mostly use my pc for gaming and coding. \n\n  \nThe reviews I saw online said that the AOC had some color problems but they could be fixed with a drivers update. As for the MSI one, most of the specs were great, the colors were described \"amazing\", but I saw some reviews complaining about pixel density, which I find pretty important since I spend most of my time coding.\n\nIf I have the option, I'll check out both of these monitors in person. I am open to other suggestions as well, within the pricing range **±**€50. Once I buy a monitor, I'll create a detailed guide on it as well. ",

Primary use will be utilising Adobe softwares for photo and video editing along with productivity tasks until Apple release an upgrade Studio Display. Maximum budget is £1K. \nNot fussed about super high refresh rates but 120Hz ideally for console gaming in the future (or whenever GTA VI ever releases!). 100% sRGB colour accuracy would be good too. I rarely print my work so AdobeRGB isn’t a priority but good to have. \nDo I go for 5K IPS 27” monitor with the BenQ or 4K WOLED 32” with the LG?\nAny insight and advice would be appreciated! ",

That’s why I didn’t aim for a mini-led but rarher for an IPS (I don’t think HDR is for me).\n\nI’m also obsessed with longevity so I’ll maybe get an OLED later as a second screen but not right now.\n\nRight now my laptop has a rtx 4080 but I may build a new PC if needed.\n\nBudget isn’t a problem but space is so I’m aiming for a 27\".\n\nWhich bring me to today with a sale on both the KTC H27P6 (299€) and the H27E6 (265€) wich both have good reviews on DisplayNinja.\n\nWhich monitor would you recommend ? (I don’t mind if you recommend other monitors but prices tend to be on the high end in France which make other model’s value not that good)\n\nThanks a lot for your help, I still have a lot to learn so I may be off the mark (I hope not !)",

My monitor setup is a 3 monitor in a H setup (two monitors on the right in verticle and the center main is horizontal). My graphics card is a AMD RAdeon Pro W7500, and a AMD 9900x cpu. I typically sit around 4-5ft away from my screens being I have good eye sight (no zoom/scaling, I like to use around 10pt fonts in excel and 12pt fonts in my broswer)\n\nMy current planned upgrade of my main montior from a Asus ProArt 2.5k 27\" 16:9 (2560x1440) to a Benq 4k RD280U for the extra height space of a 3:2 monitor and less intense brightness due to the programming mode. \n\nWhat I need help is on my other two monitors. Which is a Asus ProArt 16:10 24\" 1920x1200 in verticle mode. I can for sure see the pixel difference between the 2560x1440 and the 1920x1200. \n\nBut I am having mixed feelings on if I should upgrade to a 4k or a 2.5k monitor. If it was 2.5k then ill prob do a Benq SW242Q or another 27\" 2.5k Proart. If I do 4k then all my monitors is 4k but then ill have to bump up to a 4k and all of those start at 27\" min (either Benq or Asus photogarphy monitors) but 27\" takes up a lot of height space being all of those are 16:9 hence my hestancy of 27\" monitors. Another RD280U 3:2 is pretty much a 27\" with more height so that dont solve that problem (though I can just not do the verticle layout in that case)\n\n\nAny suggetions or advice?\n\nEdit: gah typo for title Size -> Side.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys, just got a Philips Evnia 27M2N5901A/00 and since I don't want to use the ambiglow, I went into the OSD and searched for an option to turn it off and seemingly found it, so I turned off the option in the OSD. \nUnfortunately, the only thing that happened was that in the OSD I now cannot choose the ambiglow menu no more, the ambiglow leds on the back of the monitor are still all on.\nSo I used the OSD to reset the monitor... still no change.\nSo I installed the software for the monitor hoping that I would be able to change the ambiglow settings there... but there were no options. The software seems to be able to talk to the monitor via the usb cable I plugged into monitor and pc since it checked the firmware of the usb hub and the monitor and reported both were up to date.\nSo I went to the AI parrots for help, they suggested to do a few things which I tried but to no avail.\nAnd lastly I went to the philips support page but there ambilight wasn't even mentioned.\n\nHelp me, please!\n\nTLDR:\nTurned off ambilight, didn't work, now ambilight menu in OSD is greyed out and ambilight still on",

    "selftext": "Hi, I bought a third monitor (AOC 24B31H) but every time my monitors wake from standby mode the monitor disconnects and reconnects. It takes a second or two and it scatters my windows around, sometimes it causes applications with GPU acceleration to have issues. So it's super annoying.\n\nWindows 10 (newest version)\n\nRX5700xt (on newest drivers)\n\nThe monitor is connected with HDMI. HDMI source is set in the monitor settings, so it's not searching other inputs. And it's the only monitor doing this.\n\nI looked up other posts, but the symptoms aren't always the same. And most of the replies either weren't applicable to me. Or they just didn't work.\n\nI didn't find any power saving options in the monitors settings.\n\nAny idea why? Any troubleshooting tips appreciated.",

My monitor setup is a 3 monitor in a H setup (two monitors on the right in verticle and the center main is horizontal). My graphics card is a AMD RAdeon Pro W7500, and a AMD 9900x cpu. I typically sit around 4-5ft away from my screens being I have good eye sight (no zoom/scaling, I like to use around 10pt fonts in excel and 12pt fonts in my broswer)\n\nMy current planned upgrade of my main montior from a Asus ProArt 2.5k 27\" 16:9 (2560x1440) to a Benq 4k RD280U for the extra height space of a 3:2 monitor and less intense brightness due to the programming mode. \n\nWhat I need help is on my other two monitors. Which is a Asus ProArt 16:10 24\" 1920x1200 in verticle mode. I can for sure see the pixel difference between the 2560x1440 and the 1920x1200. \n\nBut I am having mixed feelings on if I should upgrade to a 4k or a 2.5k monitor. If it was 2.5k then ill prob do a Benq SW242Q or another 27\" 2.5k Proart. If I do 4k then all my monitors is 4k but then ill have to bump up to a 4k and all of those start at 27\" min (either Benq or Asus photogarphy monitors) but 27\" takes up a lot of height space being all of those are 16:9 hence my hestancy of 27\" monitors. Another RD280U 3:2 is pretty much a 27\" with more height so that dont solve that problem (though I can just not do the verticle layout in that case)\n\n\nAny suggetions or advice?\n\nEdit: gah typo for title Size -> Side.",

    "selftext": "Good morning, headphone Reddit!\n\nMany of you may have heard of [owliophile.com](http://owliophile.com), some haven't. It's a tool to create personalized EQ settings for your headphone on your head, and it's focused on convenience and usability.\n\nWe have now created a how-to video that shows how we (the creators) use the tool. The approach shown in the video is only one of multiple possible ways and there's more information in the Q&A section.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo)\n\nNote: You will need an EQ app like EqualizerAPO / Peace or EqMac to comfortably listen to music and other things on your system -- the Owliophile tool is only there to help you find the right settings.\n\nWe're planning to make more videos on the technical / theoretical background, as well as explaining all details of the tool, so if you're curious you are welcome to subscribe to the channel. Anyway, I hope this first one serves as a good and practical introduction to the topic of personalized equalization for some of you.\n\nCheers!  \nOwlio",

    "title": "Audeze LCD 2C - One Month Review",
    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

Loved how clear and Fun everything sounded to me and thus learned more about sound in general. Then I got some Kz iems, liked it and switch over to the Letshouer S12, but then my m4's broke. So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

Now, just disregard audio quality completely. I'm just talking noise cancelling with ANC. How is it that airpod pro 3s beat the xm5 in noise cancellation with ANC on? I mean thats what the graph shows - much higher attentuation dBs for the APP3s compared to the XM5s. They do fizzle out near the high pitched end but im guessing that overears even without ANC are better in blocking out high freq noise because of the build material and clamping over ears. Seems like ANC doesnt make much of a difference for XM5s anyways on the high end. So my question is that ive seen all over the internet that overears + anc are always better than wireless earbuds (air pods). Why is this case different? Or am i a total idiot and i dont understand the graphs or the context. ",

    "selftext": "I've never in my entire life, having visited more than 10 different audio shops around Asia, South East Asia, NA and Oceania-- have I ever encountered a store that makes me feel as unwelcome and as bothersome to the staff as I have in Addicted to Audio. \n\nI was greeted at the door, that's great. But upon sitting at demo area, having exchanged a few pleasantries with the staff, their attitude quickly changed. Asking them about anything would yield a response that came across unbothered or sometimes annoyed. Sometimes the staff outright ignored me, completely unbothered, clicking away on his phone/laptop when the room is completely silent and just the two of us, when I made a comment or asked a question. \n\nI've gotten responses like \"Huh? Oh. Yeah, ok.\", \"Pick something else then.\"\n\nIt's not even just what they say or don't say, but it's how they say it. They really made me feel like they didn't want my business. Oddly they would only ever respond if you asked about the price. For such a niche hobby for enthusiasts, the staff at Addicted to Audio seem incredibly uninterested in audio at all. \n\nThe audio hobby is already so niche, rarely ever coming by others who share the interest. I'd like to enter an enthusiast store and meet other enthusiasts who actually care and want to share their love of audio. \n\nIf the staff are so uninterested then they should just work at Harvey Norman or JB HiFi where customers actually don't want to engage the staff. \n\nI'm an experienced audiophile with a fairly deep appreciation and budget. I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment. The local audiophile circle feel the same way and have since chosen to bring their business to Minidisc instead. ",

    "title": "Lets talk about the new Edition XV",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/it1hxzzqlrxf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=5912a58e06d71ad339cda4f905209e4b1052edb0\n\nI compared a few headphones a couple of days ago, and a lot of people wanted to hear more about the Edition XV. So let’s talk about it.\n\nAmong all the headphones I’ve listened to, the closest one might be the Fiio FT1 Pro. The moment I put the Edition XV on, I instantly felt this warmth spreading through me — like being wrapped in honey. You’ll know what I mean once you try it.\n\n**Bass (before & after eq using oratory 1990's, the EQ didn't change the conclusion below)**\n\nThe most distinctive thing about the Edition XV, to my ears, is its **meaty bass**. It’s thick, elastic, and feels like it’s hugging the sides of your ears. It’s not the fast, clean kind of bass you get from the HE600. It’s the wet, creamy kind — like your ears are being gently massaged with a cloth soaked in oil.\n\nThe bass also has more layers than the FT1 Pro, but the FT1 Pro’s bass FEELS more aggressive. It’s like a scholar delivering an insult — refined, yet every word cuts deep. There’s more nuance and subtlety here, unlike the FT1 Pro, which just lashes out bluntly. Naturally, this makes the Edition XV sound a bit less aggressive at first. But if you listen closely, the impact is still there — it just feels smoother and more full-bodied.\n\nThat said, not everyone listens critically all the time. When I’m just relaxing, I sometimes *feel* like the FT1 Pro has more bass (even though that’s not actually true if you listen critically when A/B them). I just want to bring this up because sometimes people would only describe stuff in their critical listening sessions, but headphones could feel VERY  different in daily casual listening.\n\n**Mids**\n\nNow, the mids. Vocals on the Edition XV are closer and more intimate than typical Hifiman models like the Arya Stealth or Edition XS, but still a bit farther away than on the FT1 Pro. The voice is rich, full, and slightly nasal. For female vocals, the singer can sound about ten years older than she actually is. That’s not necessarily good or bad — it’s all down to taste.\n\nThe vocals lean on the darker side. Compared to the FT1 Pro, they’re more refined but also smoother — which means you lose some of that raw texture in the voice, like the growls in the rock music. Personally, I prefer the FT1 Pro’s vocal texture; it carries more emotion like anger or passion. The Arya Stealth also feels more emotional than the Edition XV, but for a different reason — it has more treble, more air, and that shimmer in the highs makes the vocals feel alive and vibrant. (You know those highs that vibrate with your skulls?)\n\nStill, the Edition XV has its own charm. A lot of 80s and 90s tracks — songs like city pop — take on a totally different vibe here. In fact, I’d describe the Edition XV as a **vibe** in itself. You know those days when you’re tired of all the crap and just want to chill, wrapped in a soft blanket, hugging a pillow? That’s what the Edition XV feels like. It won’t shock you, it won’t thrill you — it just gives you that warm, steady, safe harbor you want to come home to.\n\n**Treble**\n\nThe treble is soft — no sibilance, no sting. The FT1 Pro is more exciting in this area, which is why I think it’s the better all-rounder. The Edition XV, though, owns its signature mood completely.\n\n**Others**\n\nAs for soundstage — the Edition XV’s lateral stage is narrower than its front-to-back depth. Sometimes the sound on both sides feels smeared onto a flat plane beside your ears, kind of vibrating there, which feels a bit unnatural. The FT1 Pro’s stage is even smaller, but it doesn’t have that issue.\n\nOverall, the Edition XV definitely has better detail retrieval and imaging than the FT1 Pro.\n\n**I wouldn't use a \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this headphone, since it is so special in the Hifiman lineup that I don't think there is any other hifiman headphone that can be compared with it. It is its own vibe, and if you can vibe with it, then it can probably beat those far more expensive headphones for you. If you can't (for example, you really enjoy other Hifiman lineups), it's really hard to say if you would enjoy it as much as others do.**\n\nHere is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1odsod7/comparison_between_he600_edition_xv_edition_xs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from a couple of days ago if you want to know more about my preference in sounds.",

    "selftext": "\nThe Hifiman Arya stealth are absurdly good for the price I got them at. At just below 500 dollars it’s the Ultimate endgame headphone for me. \n\nThe comfort is very nice. The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it’s Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth’s do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it’s a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it’s very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn’t too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren’t for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can’t wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now. Maybe later in life I’ll upgrade but I know diminishing returns hit really hard after this so it’s a matter until I have some cash ready to burn. \n\n\n\n",

My set is: \n\n• Grado RS2x \n• HiFiman Subdara (2020)\n• Schiit Vali 2++\n• Schiit Modi\n\nI’ve had the Grados for a couple of years now and every time I use them it reminds me why i got into this “hobby” in the first place. Absolutely gorgeous in the mid range and with a little EQ (+3db at 100hz) the bass feels a bit more full. What floors me about the RS2x’s is how natural instruments sound with them. Jazz, rock—pretty much anything with actual instruments sounds incredible. Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can’t imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these. They’re far from neutral but if you like the way they color music Grados are some of the best cans. After 15+ years of experience with their headphones I feel like I have “arrived” with these and my modest budget audiophile set up. \n\nThe HiFimans are a delight as well. Far more neutral, but man can they be EQed. No distortion with any level of reasonable EQ on the bass so if I want to put on some electronic music and blast some chunky thick bass directly into my brain, these are the cans to do it. While I definitely use the Grados more, these are an amazing second set to have at my desk for when I listen to music that the Grados aren’t well suited for. (Not that other music sounds /bad/ on them, it’s just not what they excel at.)\n\nNone of my friends are big into audio and they’ve heard me rant about my cans probably more times they can count so I thought I’d dump my thoughts and adoration of my set up here. \n\nFeel free to share your desktop set up’s as well I’d love to see what other people are working with, gear-wise. \n",

I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.\n\nThe price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65€**.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn’t have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.\n\nMy surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle… but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.\n\n\n\n**Will they meet my tastes?**\n\nFirst, let’s look at the **package contents:**\n\n\\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  \n\\-User **manual**.  \n\\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  \n\\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  \n\\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  \n\\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  \n\\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.\n\n\n\n**They look comfortable, right?**\n\nThis is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.\n\nThe answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn’t have started better.\n\nThe capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone’s auricle and ear canal.\n\nFor this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.\n\nThe cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn’t tangle, and doesn’t pull by catching on your clothing.\n\nI don’t know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.\n\nWhat I didn’t find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn’t fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.\n\n\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n\\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  \n\\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  \n\\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  \n\\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz\n\nThe **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.\n\nI would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.\n\n\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nThese **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.\n\nMy experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.\n\nI could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone’s intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.\n\nHowever, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.\n\n*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn’t the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.\n\n*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn’t interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.\n\n*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.\n\n*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don’t feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.\n\n*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.\n\n*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don’t need more, nor do I want it.\n\n*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors’ tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.\n\n*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.\n\n*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.\n\n**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.\n\nRegarding **layering**: I don’t know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can’t believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.\n\n\n\nNow let’s talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.\n\nI encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\nThe source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.\n\nIn the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.\n\nIn *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn’t be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.\n\nRegarding Kratos’ very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.\n\nIn the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn’t the highest resolution experience I’ve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.\n\nThe child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.\n\nContinuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.\n\nAnd let’s go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it’s the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*\n\nWell, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.\n\nNevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn’t the best for purists since listening wasn’t fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.\n\n\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI don’t want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I’ve tested. At least up to the **100€/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what’s the point of spending more money?\n\nI acknowledge it isn’t perfect. In fact, technically, it’s inferior to two other competitors in its price range I’ve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I’m not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.\n\nThey have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn’t hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.\n\nMy sincerest congratulations to the brand.\n\nThank you for reading if you’ve made it this far.\n\n**See you in the next review.**\n\n**Greetings!**",

    "title": "Myer Audio SLIIVO SL224 Earphones Review",
    "selftext": "I didn't expect much from Myer Audio, and I didn't really follow their work. The CKLVX D62 model is still popular, although it gets a lot more attention than it really deserves, I think; the SL41 MK2 one was excellent, but the next few models didn't seem to stand out in the stream of endless Chinese specialties.\n\nTherefore, I approached the next model, SLIIVO SL224, with minimum expectations. My loss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij95o9whopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2c35707a8bb0ad7bea5154dacf5740c96e62d49\n\nToday, we'll talk about SLIIVO SL224, in-ear headphones priced at $285 (as of October 2025).\n\n# All but the sound\n\nThe earphones are delivered in a cardboard box, normal-sized for the earphones of this price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46te32ckopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaf049b747a3e2612525251c1f342557f1e6e261\n\nIn the box, we can find the earphones themselves, a round leather case, 7 pairs of eartips, and a cable with replaceable connectors. No surprises.\n\nThe cable is beautiful, nice, with a resistance of 0.3 Ohms. The connectors are inserted and fixed to the cable with coarse-threaded nuts. This approach feels reliable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yq7y8nlopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e39369d65e608cae16450636cf618925bd366a2c\n\nIn addition to the 3.5 and 4.4 mm connectors, a Type-C connector was also included, which, of course, is not a connector at all, but a DAC. The DAC works exclusively in 16-bit/48 kHz mode, in Plug'n'play mode, with standard drivers in Windows 11, if nothing else. There are no special drivers on the [manufacturer's website](https://myeraudio.com/) (however, the website looks like it's being barely maintained, to put it mildly). The Walk Play app doesn't see it. But thanks for including it anyway.\n\nThere are 3 pairs of slightly tighter silicone eartips of a standard shape, sizes S, M and L...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xtkizhnopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1d969d57be38137156ba8de6bb85674f71f3ff\n\n...3 more pairs of slightly softer silicone eartips...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w63t0snoopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20fc14caa0167803e16403be6c068333bf719521\n\n...as well as 1 pair of foam ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy6v1cxpopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cca6a13136ec2ef430ce9374cb05ea4469a0a812\n\nThe earphones themselves are technically made on the basis of a menagerie of 2 dynamic (6 and 10 mm), 2 armature and 4 microplanar drivers, or a total of 8 drivers in each earphone. Each of the driver types plays back lower, middle, and upper frequencies, respectively.\n\nThe earphones' enclosures are made of polymer resin and have a pronounced relief, that is, ergonomic depressions and projections.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfydif6ropxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0e22a05e4a02671e7249bbe0040085de8fcb5d1\n\nThe radius of the metal part of the sound guide is 6.25 mm. in the thick end part and 5.55 in the main part.\n\nThe outer inserts are made of natural mother-of-pearl placed under a layer of transparent plastic. Mother-of-pearl mysteriously shimmers in the light, and small defects only emphasize the natural origin of the material and are not noticeable in reality.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uo0fwmj7ruxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4057aa4590b0ca2e33a8365e4e610daf0a21b1b8\n\nThe connector pad is flat, it is slightly recessed into the housing. The compensation hole is covered with a plastic grate fused into the housing.\n\nThe earphones are designed for an average depth of the fit and have standard diameters of sound ducts by modern standards, so you can experiment with eartips at great length and with abandon: SpinFit CP100+, Pentaconn COREIR, Roseselsa SoundCocoon, Divinus Prism Wide Bore – [they all](https://boizoff.com/eartips_part_4/) fit and let you comfortably place the earphones in your ears. I never managed to settle on anything specific, as they all are fine.\n\nI can't say anything bad about SL224 in terms of user experience and ergonomics – they're just well-made modern in-ear headphones without any pitfalls. Of course, their black polished plastic surface scratches quickly and collects fingerprints, but that's how 99% of all headphones are made now, so there's nothing we can do. I can also complain about the case: for the earphones of this size and the cable of this length and thickness, this case is frankly small. Give me a bigger one now!\n\nAs for the electrical characteristics, the manufacturer claims a resistance of 36 Ω and a sensitivity of 108 dB. I can't comment on the second value, but I've recently become able to measure resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vktmk7topxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0087afee237e878d735e0bae6214e181dd579035\n\nIt varies from 34 to 14 Ω.\n\n# The sound\n\n*Standard links:*\n\n1. *the description of my rig is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/renovation-of-my-measuring-rig-for-headphones/)*;*\n2. *the audiogram of my hearing is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/audiogram/)*;*\n3. *articles on measurement theory and the whole shebang are* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/category/audiophile/theory/)*.*\n\nFrequency response of SLIIVO SL224 earphones with original foam eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hfl2191ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cea47660d534a586276350a062dc957e1a569d4\n\nAnd, before analyzing the frequency response, let me remind you that this frequency response will strongly depend on the depth of the fit. Frequency response of SL224 for the second resonance at 7000, 7500, 8000 and 8500 Hz:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lbyhjm2ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb404456030ce4a4c3f442905acc9d1c7a41284\n\nNote that there is no simple displacement of the resonant peak. On the contrary, the entire range from 3 to 20 kHz changes significantly, and only the emphasis at 12 kHz remains more or less stable in terms of volume and 'width', so to speak. The key thing that can be seen from these graphs is that the deeper the earphones are placed in the auditory canals, the lower the area before the second resonance 'droops' and the higher the peak rises around 15 kHz.\n\nComparison of frequency response for original foam and silicone eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg8uwbu4ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c2be14aaa3c3c99ba0cf535c6d00c6b7b3175bc\n\nAnyway, we can see the following on the graphs:\n\n* it seems to be a more or less typical sound delivery a la Harman;\n* but with reduced subbass;\n* and with a 'muffled', but rather 'smooth' 4-10 kHz segment;\n* as well as with an expansion after 10 kHz, the nature of which depends on the eartips. The graph obtained when using silicone eartips is more valid for my ears.\n\nBesides, consider a slight rise in the bass, about 250 Hz, as well as the shape of the 600 Hz to 3 kHz segment – it’s almost linear. We'll talk below how this affects the SL224 sound perception.\n\nNonlinear distortion at 94 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g2c9x48ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=031fd6a69ca193c02a48b3996e51ed689a3e213e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrc4ao19ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3afce27b77c8e94f80bfa77f522bdc0e82f1eec\n\nNonlinear distortion at 104 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_1.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_1.jpg)\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_2.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_2.jpg)\n\nThere's not much to comment on here: at 94 dB, the distortion is just over 0.5% at the maximum; at 104 dB volume, it's over 1%. That is, they have no audible effect on the sound.\n\nMinimum phase response, group delay, and spectrogram in the 'Burst decay' mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kxxdhfdppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbabddd9448e7feaa7bfba5bd9e255749fba11db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfq42o6eppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=258891b29d856b4a4102a1ee88176893e93ffc2b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jadpkhseppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e62b9f7e963ddeb411d1c3629b85179cc9f17a3\n\nIt's a common near-ideal pattern, typical for all modern in-ears of a similar price.\n\nMy subjective evaluation is that I'm blown away primarily by how full-fledged the SL224 sound delivery turned out to be. And I deliberately don't use the word 'balanced' because it refers to the concept of neutrality. Literally everything in the sound of these earphones is in place. All frequencies are exactly in the amount that my ear personally expects. There is a very, very weighty, but technical subbass, a 'close' articulated middle with a hearing-friendly range at about 6-8 kHz, and an airy lightness after 10 kHz. It's very difficult to describe this sound because it's 'correct' and 'tasty' at the same time. In other words, you definitely won't be able to complain about tonal inaccuracy as it's at a very high level, but you also have this feeling of a 'spectacular' sound. It's difficult for me to clearly connect this with measurement graphs, but I assume that it's the linear range of 600-3000 Hz (and here we can move on to an endless debate about how to correctly combine frequency response graphs for comparison), as well as some emphasis on ultra-high frequencies that speak for themselves.\n\nA standalone interesting quality of these earphones, which I really appreciate and which is relatively rare, is the instrument sound separation. It's just splendid. You can listen to each vocal line, percussion, each component of the track separately and distinguish its perception from the overall musical flow.\n\nMoreover, the width of the sound stage is clearly larger than average. SL224 play in a large-scale, airy manner, and the recording space noticeably lives and breathes. The music plays 'around your head' and even more or less from behind rather than between your ears.\n\nAs one would expect with such sound delivery, these earphones are very versatile in terms of suitable musical content. The only limitation, apart from your taste, is the quality of tracks. If a sound engineer has been careful about recording and processing of the high frequency area, everything will be fine. If they haven't, you will be hearing weird and unpleasant things.\n\n# Comparisons\n\nIf we compare within the price category, guided by the [best online rating of in-ear monitors](https://boizoff.com/language/en/the-best-iems/), then the following models will be next to SL224:\n\n* PULA ANVIL 114\n* Letshuoer Cadenza 4\n* Kiwi Ears Orchestra Lite.\n\nI have compared them, of course, up-close and personal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1p7xn3ippxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0934c4bb516dc35126dc0ced23e9d82aefefd3ec\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to ANVIL 114: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_ANVIL114.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_ANVIL114.png)\n\nWhen A/B-ing, ANVIL 114 fully justify their name, hitting the listener's ears with a steel hammer: this is a massive, 'fat' sound supported by a bone conduction driver against the rather neutral, 'elegant' SL224 sound delivery.\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Cadenza 4: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Cadenza\\_4.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Cadenza_4.png)\n\nCadenza 4 are an example of excellent 'light' headphones. Compared to SL224, they have more 'top' and less 'bottom' in almost identical proportions. The Cadenza 4's sound delivery is 'airier', lighter, 'sparklier', and they have a slightly smoother section after 10 kHz, while SL224, again, are more neutral and, therefore, more versatile in comparison.\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Orchestra Lite: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Orchestra\\_Lite.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Orchestra_Lite.png)\n\nWe love Orchestra Lite for their infinitely expressive 'middle'. It seems that Orchestra Lite deliver sound even 'closer' to the listener, and they're a little brighter if we evaluate the sound delivery by and large, but SL224 win in terms of reliability and 'punch'.\n\nIf we look at the SL224 tuning conceptually, so to speak, then we need to compare them with completely different earphones – [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/) and [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o78vvvipppxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ca90c5ee84b8406929c106d0d5555ef26ddc5b\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Meteor: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Meteor.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Meteor.png)\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Mega5-EST: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Mega5-EST.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Mega5-EST.png)\n\nAll three graphs compared:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mna3exppxf1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65aac9b4a17b9c969bac7fa6de31bcb38d5dc526\n\nCompared to Meteor, SL224 have a weightier bass and subbass due to a less pronounced middle; the Meteor sound seems sterile and faded against SL224. And, compared to Mega5-EST SL224, on the contrary, they're slightly less bassy, and the midrange is more pronounced. By ear, the SL224's sound delivery is almost perfectly equidistant from the tunings of these two models. The only thing that SL224 don't have is a smooth (by ear) frequency response after 10 kHz, which competitors can boast of. SL224 deliver this segment clearer, but less accurate. But prices vary accordingly, too.\n\nThe only aspect where I can name the best option for less money is gaming: from a positioning point of view, [KBEAR Cepheus](https://boizoff.com/language/en/kbear-cepheus-earphones-review/) remain unattainable and subjectively the best headphones for competitive games. But SL224 are also quite good in this context, don't get me wrong.\n\n# Summary\n\nI believe that the SL224's entry into the market is a significant milestone in the modern headphone industry. The SL224 is as iconic a model as [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/), [EPZ K9](https://boizoff.com/language/en/epz-k9-earphones-review/) or [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/) in their categories.\n\nAs for the sound… I'm willing to pay to see the first reaction to the SL224 sound of someone for whom these earphones will be the first or second under the sun, as the wow effect from their first listening is so intense, and they differ so much from 'just headphones' and any TWS. SL224 are tuned just superbly: their sound delivery is simultaneously engaging, especially if you turn up the volume, but also reliable and large-scale in the sense of a virtual sound stage.\n\nWho won't like them? 'Bassheads' and fans of listening to music in the conditions of high ambient noise, that is, on the streets of a big city (noise masking will reduce the sound of these headphones to medium and high frequencies only).\n\nTo buy or not to buy? To buy!",

Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones. I'd certainly like to hear the top-end Sony R10s or something like the Spirit Torino Valkyria and there are plenty of planar headphones out there..",

However, I am experiencing some extremely harsh, sharp and painful kind of sibilance to some vocals on some tracks. For example from 1:43-1:55 on Duckworth by Kendrick Lamar. This happens mostly on s-sounds.\n\nI found that I had to meticulously EQ around 9800 Hz (q factor of 3), reducing it by around 6-7 dB in order to get rid of this painful sound. However, I find that doing this makes the overall sound more dull, dark and less defined. I'm not sure what to do. Measurement of the AR5000's frequency response shows a big peak at around 9500 Hz, could this perhaps be why? I did not see Resolve mention this problem in his review of the headphones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/undw3zt1kpxf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c527c80ede8fe7708253b26ec1c84e2adf4e1f8\n\nI have a pair of airpods pro 2 that i have no problems with. No painful sharp vocals.\n\nIs this a common problem among people? And is having to perform such a big EQ change even acceptable?  \nAm i experiencing this because I have a weird HRTF?  \nPerhaps any owners of the AR5000 that can give their thoughts and experience with this?",

    "title": "In the market: DCA Noire XO or E3?",
    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI know the question is odd since it's a open vs closed back DCA, however I am in the market for a new set. For my listening tastes, my 6XX doesn't cut it. I then got a planar FT1 Pro and the widened soundstage is nice, but I hate certain aspects of the headphones (including the stock pads and putting on some Dekoni LCD-type pads certainly changed the headphones too much) and I find it really sounds bad when I drive them with EQ that brings it closer to Harman. The dips I can hear in 2K-5K is very annoying to try and EQ properly and I haven't been able to make it right with the new pads; they're either distant or very grating.\n\nConversly, I noticed that once I tuned my 6XX's close to Harman using ortary's EQ, I vastly enjoyed the sound more, but the technical aspects of the 6XX's were starting to bug me, like the lack of Impact of bass and the narrow soundstage,\n\nHence my look into DCA's more Harman tuned headphones. I have heard very good things about E3, namely that it has a vast sound-stage for a closed back, large drivers/earcups (I do have a big fuggin head), etc. etc. However, now that I see that the Noire XO is out for several hundred less, I am also looking at these, namely on DMS' recommendation and his bit about \"if you LPF after 10k, you effectively get E3\". Pair the Noire XO's promising looking bass response, I am at a bit of a decision paralysis between the two for an end-game desktop setup.\n\nSo, for people that have listened to one or the other, is the E3 worth it for the extra money vs the Noire XO in your own personal opinion? What about for someone like myself that wants a more Harman tuned, wider soundstage headphone? It's one thing to say \"has a wide soundstage for a closed back\", but then how does it compare to an actual open back in the Noire XO?\n\nThanks! :)\n\ne; I also don't live anywhere near a place to test each.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

    "selftext": "These have supplanted the Sennheiser HD6xx as my favorite open back and the one I use daily. The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else. I would be perfectly happy with these as my open back and Aeon Closed RT as my closed back for the forseeable future.",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by Edifier or have any commercial interests in selling headphones. I just like music and love a good deal.\n\nThe Edifier WH950NB likely need no introduction; they launched for €150 in Europe two years ago, have been around €110 for a long time, and the white model has dipped to €71 for a week a few months ago. I bought them on launch, and waited for a long time to form my opinion.\n\nI commute a few hours with them daily, and charge them once a week. I'm coming from a Hifiman Deva Pro, Sennheiser HD58X, and HD560S. I cannot overstate it: these headphones are phenomenal. Not \"good enough for Bluetooth headphones\", no, I often use them as my preferred listening experience over the others.\n\nHere's the secret: you get a (somewhat restricted) parametric EQ in the Edifier app. However, I created a preset from data (and my ears) that sounds so, so much better than the default tuning (see attached image for graphs):\n\n39Hz -3dB 2.0 (Optional)\n\n3000Hz -8dB 2.0\n\n3300Hz 3dB 2.0\n\n9000Hz 3dB 0.5\n\nIf you use UAPP on Android you can do automatic sample rate switching so you bypass Android's resampler on LDAC, and with some extra parametric EQ bands in UAPP you can improve the sound signature slightly more (I can add my preset in a comment if anyone is interested).\n\nOther than sound signature, these do everything you'd expect from a modern pair of BT headphones. There's passive and active 3.5mm support, a massive two-week battery, multiple ANC modes, multi-point Bluetooth 5.3, 96/32 LDAC, safe volume limiter, low latency mode, theater surround sound mode, and most importantly, an amazing travel case with a bunch of accessoires included (airplane splitter, usb-c cable, 3.5mm L-shape cable, protection pad for the folded cup).\n\nGenuinely wondering how no one is talking about these. Some of my family members, friends and colleagues bought one on my recommendation and they all think it's an amazing product. I only hear about the €300+ products from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser etc.\n\nIs there anyone else that has these?\n\nEdit: Formatting",

    "selftext": "Here's a trimmed down version of my full review over on head-fi. You can find it [here](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/aune-n7.28592/reviews).\n\n# Aune N7 Review — Mojo 2 Finds Its Match\n\nAfter upgrading to the Hifiman Arya Stealth, I wanted a proper Class A amp to bring out their full potential. I’ve long used the Chord Mojo 2 as my main DAC/amp — a brilliant device — but I suspected pairing it with a pure Class A amp might unlock something new. Enter the **Aune N7**.\n\n# Build & Design\n\nCompact, solid, and purposeful — the **N7**’s machined aluminum chassis with side heat fins looks serious and feels premium. The **volume knob** clicks smoothly but can skip if turned too fast. The **aluminum remote** feels fantastic, though its **volume buttons** could be better placed.  \nThe **display** is functional but small; no brightness control. As expected from a Class A amp, it runs warm — hand-warmer warm, not egg-frying hot. The internal temperature stays around 45°C even after long sessions.\n\n# Listening Setup\n\n**Chain:** Spotify Lossless → WiiM Mini → Mojo 2 → Aune N7 → Hifiman Arya Stealth (balanced out, high gain/high current).\n\n# Sound Impressions\n\n* **Steely Dan – “Aja”**: The N7 adds depth and weight, expanding the soundstage front-to-back. Bass gains texture; cymbals smooth out; the sax solo feels more alive. Some upper-mid sparkle is softened, but the trade-off is cohesion.\n* **Bill Evans Trio – “Sunday at the Village Vanguard”**: The sense of space and realism jumps. You don’t just hear LaFaro’s bass — you feel it resonate. Evans’ piano takes on body and warmth, and brushwork on the snare is wonderfully tactile.\n* **Snarky Puppy – “We Like It Here”**: A perfect showcase for the N7’s Class A dynamics. Everything stays tight and layered even in dense sections. You lose a touch of bite on transients, but gain richness and flow.\n* **Martha Argerich – Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3**: The Mojo alone is precise but dry. Add the N7 and the sound breathes — the piano has weight and the hall ambience comes alive.\n* **Entheogenic – “Dreamtime Physics”**: Electronica gains dimension and slam. Sub-bass digs deeper, highs shimmer smoothly, and the sound feels enveloping. The N7’s black background lets microdetails emerge effortlessly.\n\n# Tonal Character\n\nThe **N7** sits between **neutral and warm**, adding body without syrup. It turns the Mojo 2’s clinical precision into a more natural, organic presentation — like switching from a microscope to a beautifully developed photo. Mids are dense, bass tight, highs extended yet smooth.\n\n# Noise & Power\n\nAbsolutely silent, even at high gain. The Arya Stealth reaches satisfying levels around 10–15/30 volume steps, leaving plenty of headroom. Rated at **6.5W @ 32Ω balanced**, the N7 drives demanding planars effortlessly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe **Aune N7** is a **$399 Class A gem** — compact, powerful, and genuinely musical. It transforms the Mojo 2 from analytical to alive, and makes the Arya Stealth sound more organic and fatigue-free.  \nIf you want long, engaging sessions and real Class A smoothness without spending big or cluttering your desk, this is the one. Mine’s staying put — and that’s the best endorsement I can give.",

    "selftext": "**Without EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth: best all rounder, widest soundstage, great imaging, superior separation, hefty bass\n2. Arya Stealth: sterile, thin sounding, decent bass\n3. HE6se V2: less refined than Arya Stealth, very neutral and clinical, honky and boxy telephone-like sound (some may prefer this), very fast and dynamic.\n\n**With EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth (does not require EQ): still the best allrounder\n2. HE6se V2: very natural and smooth, great 3D sound with slightly less stage size than Arya Sealth, more weight and slam, excellent midrange, amazing separation\n3. Arya Stealth: fuller and richer but less emphasis than HE6 in many ways, slightly more balanced and smoother, good overall sound for a number of different use cases\n\nBoth the HE6se V2 (EQ'd) and HE1000 Stealth trade blows. It's definitely no slouch and ever so slightly prefer it over the HE1000 Stealth with certain genres such as rock and metal. For everything else including classical music, and videogame/movie OST's such as LOTR, Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 etc. the HE1000 Stealth is the overall winner, including Rap and Hip-Hop.\n\nThe most noticeable factors of the HE1000 Stealth over the Arya Stealth is note weight and staging. Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be £3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

    "selftext": "Hi, I have recently aquired Arya Stealth headphones and don't plan to buy much else cause they are fantastic in most situations. However, I do listen to lots of metal, and in some tracks, especially more chaotic with lots going on or just old and badly mixed - Aryas get a little bit harsh. Equalizer works great but it also kinda kills the beautiful detail on other songs, so it feels like a compromise. I can get used to switching equalizer settings but I can also afford another pair of headphones, that would be used for more casual listening or metal in general. \n\nBudget is flexible if it's worth it. I've been thinking about HD490Pro or HD660S2 (listened to both in a shop nearby, sounded nice and relaxed, but plastic build felt a bit cheap), maybe audeze LCD-2c (didn't get to listen to). It has to be different to be worth it, probably warmer, more forgiving, less harsh, but still a good hi-fi headphones. Any opinions are welcome!",

    "selftext": "That's what I want to know. Regardless of what experts, reviews or anyone what is saying: what is your perfect pair of headphones? \n\nI used to have a pair of first generation Sennheiser Momentum but then due to working from home and getting a Jabra Evolve 75 SE from my company for calls I stopped using them and somehow lost them. \n\nRecently there came a point, though, where I got sick and tired from listening to music on them. I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring. At that moment I realised that they are perfect for me.",

    "title": "Quick comparison of Arya Stealth vs Edition XS for metal music",
    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it’s tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For “heavier” music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that’s clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It’s an excellent headphone and if you don’t AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

    "title": "CCA CRA+: pure fun at a ridiculous price.",
    "selftext": "Hello Community!\n\nThis time it's the review of a low-cost product, but just because it costs little money doesn't mean we should forget about this range. In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n·        FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n·        FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n·        FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n·        FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n·        FiiO KA11.\n\n·        FiiO JA11.\n\n·        MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n·        Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n·        Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n·        Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n·        Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**€13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 €/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of €30 than one of €100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but…\n\n…let's start with the **package content:**\n\n·        The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n·        User manual\n\n·        A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n·        A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n·        The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the €13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n·        A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n·        Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n·        Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n·        Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but… the highs got easily out of control…\n\n… I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is… somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child’s voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors’ behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies’ guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **€13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n ",

We live in a rural area and it’s two hours to the nearest so it’s a novel event and we wandered around checking out everything . Outside of some Bose about 15+ years ago, I’ve never had occasion to be near NC Headphones. \n\nAnyway, I popped these on and EVERYTHING went dead silent. Best of all, my wife’s voice, right in front of my face trying to talk to me. Reminded me of that scene in, I think, Face Off with travolta and cage where someone drops headphones of soothing music on the little 4 yr old kid and then a huge gun battle breaks out. In that crazy, crowded, noisy store I heard nothing but soft cool jazz. I could see my wife’s lips moving but could hear a word and it was pure bliss. Not sure which model I had but they were like $500+ at the time. \n\nQ: Anything BETTER, or cheaper yet still super isolating and effective these days? How would I go about trying other models out? \n\nAlso appreciate advice on replacing ear pads, battery life, overall longevity of devices. ",

For example jumping out the plane in warzone the wind and engine sounded like it was actually up in your face if that makes sense, but with the Maxwells it just sounds thinned out.

Instead, they delivered a flimsy build, muddy audio, and abysmal customer service, making this purchase a complete letdown.\nDurability: Shockingly Fragile\nThe website claims the H1H survived 1.8m drops onto hard floors, but this is a blatant lie. My headphones’ headband snapped in two after a mere 0.4m drop onto a soft carpeted floor. For a premium product, this fragility is outrageous. The 308g weight also made them uncomfortable for extended wear, and the satin finish attracted fingerprints, further cheapening the experience.\n\nCustomer Service: Insulting Response,\n\nWhen I contacted Heavys about the broken headband, their response was slow and unhelpful. After days of generic emails, they offered a 25% discount on another purchase. Why would I buy a faulty product again? This dismissive attitude left me feeling cheated and ignored.\n\nSound and Features: Substandard,\n\nThe sound was bass-heavy and muddy, burying vocals and guitars in tracks like Iron Maiden’s Run to the Hills. The app’s EQ barely helped, and the soundstage felt cramped. The “Hell Blocker” noise cancellation was ineffective against basic background noise, and clunky buttons made adjustments a hassle.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Heavys H1H are a massive disappointment. A fragile build, false durability claims, poor sound, and insulting customer service make these headphones a waste of money. Metal fans, steer clear and invest in something reliable.",

    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

Loved how clear and Fun everything sounded to me and thus learned more about sound in general. Then I got some Kz iems, liked it and switch over to the Letshouer S12, but then my m4's broke. So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

But upon sitting at demo area, having exchanged a few pleasantries with the staff, their attitude quickly changed. Asking them about anything would yield a response that came across unbothered or sometimes annoyed.

Oh. Yeah, ok.\", \"Pick something else then.\"\n\nIt's not even just what they say or don't say, but it's how they say it. They really made me feel like they didn't want my business. Oddly they would only ever respond if you asked about the price. For such a niche hobby for enthusiasts, the staff at Addicted to Audio seem incredibly uninterested in audio at all. \n\nThe audio hobby is already so niche, rarely ever coming by others who share the interest. I'd like to enter an enthusiast store and meet other enthusiasts who actually care and want to share their love of audio. \n\nIf the staff are so uninterested then they should just work at Harvey Norman or JB HiFi where customers actually don't want to engage the staff. \n\nI'm an experienced audiophile with a fairly deep appreciation and budget. I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment. The local audiophile circle feel the same way and have since chosen to bring their business to Minidisc instead. ",

And I went through the exact same EDM playlist I used for my initial test, so it’s not a matter of different recordings.\n\nHow did my brain just auto adjust like that? Did my perception or sensitivity to bass change over time so that the HD660S now sound perfectly balanced to me?\n\nNow I’m honestly confused about what a normal level of bass even is. If I switch to a headphone with objectively stronger bass, it’ll probably sound too much..until my brain adapts again. That’s wild.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this with headphones?",

    "selftext": "Have been using my speakers as my main listening mode lately but this past week or so I’ve been gravitating toward my desktop set up over my stereo for digital listening. My set is: \n\n• Grado RS2x \n• HiFiman Subdara (2020)\n• Schiit Vali 2++\n• Schiit Modi\n\nI’ve had the Grados for a couple of years now and every time I use them it reminds me why i got into this “hobby” in the first place. Absolutely gorgeous in the mid range and with a little EQ (+3db at 100hz) the bass feels a bit more full. What floors me about the RS2x’s is how natural instruments sound with them. Jazz, rock—pretty much anything with actual instruments sounds incredible. Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can’t imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these. They’re far from neutral but if you like the way they color music Grados are some of the best cans. After 15+ years of experience with their headphones I feel like I have “arrived” with these and my modest budget audiophile set up. \n\nThe HiFimans are a delight as well. Far more neutral, but man can they be EQed. No distortion with any level of reasonable EQ on the bass so if I want to put on some electronic music and blast some chunky thick bass directly into my brain, these are the cans to do it. While I definitely use the Grados more, these are an amazing second set to have at my desk for when I listen to music that the Grados aren’t well suited for. (Not that other music sounds /bad/ on them, it’s just not what they excel at.)\n\nNone of my friends are big into audio and they’ve heard me rant about my cans probably more times they can count so I thought I’d dump my thoughts and adoration of my set up here. \n\nFeel free to share your desktop set up’s as well I’d love to see what other people are working with, gear-wise. \n",

    "selftext": "\nThe Hifiman Arya stealth are absurdly good for the price I got them at. At just below 500 dollars it’s the Ultimate endgame headphone for me. \n\nThe comfort is very nice. The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it’s Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth’s do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it’s a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it’s very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn’t too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren’t for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can’t wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now. Maybe later in life I’ll upgrade but I know diminishing returns hit really hard after this so it’s a matter until I have some cash ready to burn. \n\n\n\n",

Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones. I'd certainly like to hear the top-end Sony R10s or something like the Spirit Torino Valkyria and there are plenty of planar headphones out there..",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/it1hxzzqlrxf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=5912a58e06d71ad339cda4f905209e4b1052edb0\n\nI compared a few headphones a couple of days ago, and a lot of people wanted to hear more about the Edition XV. So let’s talk about it.\n\nAmong all the headphones I’ve listened to, the closest one might be the Fiio FT1 Pro. The moment I put the Edition XV on, I instantly felt this warmth spreading through me — like being wrapped in honey. You’ll know what I mean once you try it.\n\n**Bass (before & after eq using oratory 1990's, the EQ didn't change the conclusion below)**\n\nThe most distinctive thing about the Edition XV, to my ears, is its **meaty bass**. It’s thick, elastic, and feels like it’s hugging the sides of your ears. It’s not the fast, clean kind of bass you get from the HE600. It’s the wet, creamy kind — like your ears are being gently massaged with a cloth soaked in oil.\n\nThe bass also has more layers than the FT1 Pro, but the FT1 Pro’s bass FEELS more aggressive. It’s like a scholar delivering an insult — refined, yet every word cuts deep. There’s more nuance and subtlety here, unlike the FT1 Pro, which just lashes out bluntly. Naturally, this makes the Edition XV sound a bit less aggressive at first. But if you listen closely, the impact is still there — it just feels smoother and more full-bodied.\n\nThat said, not everyone listens critically all the time. When I’m just relaxing, I sometimes *feel* like the FT1 Pro has more bass (even though that’s not actually true if you listen critically when A/B them). I just want to bring this up because sometimes people would only describe stuff in their critical listening sessions, but headphones could feel VERY  different in daily casual listening.\n\n**Mids**\n\nNow, the mids. Vocals on the Edition XV are closer and more intimate than typical Hifiman models like the Arya Stealth or Edition XS, but still a bit farther away than on the FT1 Pro. The voice is rich, full, and slightly nasal. For female vocals, the singer can sound about ten years older than she actually is. That’s not necessarily good or bad — it’s all down to taste.\n\nThe vocals lean on the darker side. Compared to the FT1 Pro, they’re more refined but also smoother — which means you lose some of that raw texture in the voice, like the growls in the rock music. Personally, I prefer the FT1 Pro’s vocal texture; it carries more emotion like anger or passion. The Arya Stealth also feels more emotional than the Edition XV, but for a different reason — it has more treble, more air, and that shimmer in the highs makes the vocals feel alive and vibrant. (You know those highs that vibrate with your skulls?)\n\nStill, the Edition XV has its own charm. A lot of 80s and 90s tracks — songs like city pop — take on a totally different vibe here. In fact, I’d describe the Edition XV as a **vibe** in itself. You know those days when you’re tired of all the crap and just want to chill, wrapped in a soft blanket, hugging a pillow? That’s what the Edition XV feels like. It won’t shock you, it won’t thrill you — it just gives you that warm, steady, safe harbor you want to come home to.\n\n**Treble**\n\nThe treble is soft — no sibilance, no sting. The FT1 Pro is more exciting in this area, which is why I think it’s the better all-rounder. The Edition XV, though, owns its signature mood completely.\n\n**Others**\n\nAs for soundstage — the Edition XV’s lateral stage is narrower than its front-to-back depth. Sometimes the sound on both sides feels smeared onto a flat plane beside your ears, kind of vibrating there, which feels a bit unnatural. The FT1 Pro’s stage is even smaller, but it doesn’t have that issue.\n\nOverall, the Edition XV definitely has better detail retrieval and imaging than the FT1 Pro.\n\n**I wouldn't use a \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this headphone, since it is so special in the Hifiman lineup that I don't think there is any other hifiman headphone that can be compared with it. It is its own vibe, and if you can vibe with it, then it can probably beat those far more expensive headphones for you. If you can't (for example, you really enjoy other Hifiman lineups), it's really hard to say if you would enjoy it as much as others do.**\n\nHere is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1odsod7/comparison_between_he600_edition_xv_edition_xs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from a couple of days ago if you want to know more about my preference in sounds.",

The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else.

My only purchases were some Tin Hifi T2 Plus years ago (that I can't fit properly) and my Sennheiser HD599 that I've been using for some years. I don't have a DAC and all that stuff, all is drived by my Asus motherboard on my PC\n\nI mainly use my HD599 for gaming and music listening from time to time and recently I decided to try some EQ settings on Equalizer APO with Peace using the AutoEQ presets\n\nI tried all these presets on the Harman target, but the crinacle ones sounds kinda similar to the oratory and the rtings sounds different from the others.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ceow6wu5vtxf1.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d8109aa512d516ffadcd13c41e657a4c13b5bea\n\nCould someone point me out what can I expect about this EQ presets? I tried searching myself with no sucess, and because I'm a real casual user, I can't point the differences on them\n\nI would like to know and understand if one preset it's more focused on bass, or try to bring the mids to the front and such. Some general characteristics so I can understand what are their differences",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

Now, just disregard audio quality completely. I'm just talking noise cancelling with ANC. How is it that airpod pro 3s beat the xm5 in noise cancellation with ANC on? I mean thats what the graph shows - much higher attentuation dBs for the APP3s compared to the XM5s. They do fizzle out near the high pitched end but im guessing that overears even without ANC are better in blocking out high freq noise because of the build material and clamping over ears. Seems like ANC doesnt make much of a difference for XM5s anyways on the high end. So my question is that ive seen all over the internet that overears + anc are always better than wireless earbuds (air pods). Why is this case different? Or am i a total idiot and i dont understand the graphs or the context. ",

The CKLVX D62 model is still popular, although it gets a lot more attention than it really deserves, I think; the SL41 MK2 one was excellent, but the next few models didn't seem to stand out in the stream of endless Chinese specialties.\n\nTherefore, I approached the next model, SLIIVO SL224, with minimum expectations. My loss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij95o9whopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2c35707a8bb0ad7bea5154dacf5740c96e62d49\n\nToday, we'll talk about SLIIVO SL224, in-ear headphones priced at $285 (as of October 2025).\n\n# All but the sound\n\nThe earphones are delivered in a cardboard box, normal-sized for the earphones of this price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46te32ckopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaf049b747a3e2612525251c1f342557f1e6e261\n\nIn the box, we can find the earphones themselves, a round leather case, 7 pairs of eartips, and a cable with replaceable connectors. No surprises.\n\nThe cable is beautiful, nice, with a resistance of 0.3 Ohms. The connectors are inserted and fixed to the cable with coarse-threaded nuts. This approach feels reliable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yq7y8nlopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e39369d65e608cae16450636cf618925bd366a2c\n\nIn addition to the 3.5 and 4.4 mm connectors, a Type-C connector was also included, which, of course, is not a connector at all, but a DAC. The DAC works exclusively in 16-bit/48 kHz mode, in Plug'n'play mode, with standard drivers in Windows 11, if nothing else. There are no special drivers on the [manufacturer's website](https://myeraudio.com/) (however, the website looks like it's being barely maintained, to put it mildly). The Walk Play app doesn't see it. But thanks for including it anyway.\n\nThere are 3 pairs of slightly tighter silicone eartips of a standard shape, sizes S, M and L...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xtkizhnopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1d969d57be38137156ba8de6bb85674f71f3ff\n\n...3 more pairs of slightly softer silicone eartips...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w63t0snoopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20fc14caa0167803e16403be6c068333bf719521\n\n...as well as 1 pair of foam ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy6v1cxpopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cca6a13136ec2ef430ce9374cb05ea4469a0a812\n\nThe earphones themselves are technically made on the basis of a menagerie of 2 dynamic (6 and 10 mm), 2 armature and 4 microplanar drivers, or a total of 8 drivers in each earphone. Each of the driver types plays back lower, middle, and upper frequencies, respectively.\n\nThe earphones' enclosures are made of polymer resin and have a pronounced relief, that is, ergonomic depressions and projections.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfydif6ropxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0e22a05e4a02671e7249bbe0040085de8fcb5d1\n\nThe radius of the metal part of the sound guide is 6.25 mm. in the thick end part and 5.55 in the main part.\n\nThe outer inserts are made of natural mother-of-pearl placed under a layer of transparent plastic. Mother-of-pearl mysteriously shimmers in the light, and small defects only emphasize the natural origin of the material and are not noticeable in reality.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uo0fwmj7ruxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4057aa4590b0ca2e33a8365e4e610daf0a21b1b8\n\nThe connector pad is flat, it is slightly recessed into the housing. The compensation hole is covered with a plastic grate fused into the housing.\n\nThe earphones are designed for an average depth of the fit and have standard diameters of sound ducts by modern standards, so you can experiment with eartips at great length and with abandon: SpinFit CP100+, Pentaconn COREIR, Roseselsa SoundCocoon, Divinus Prism Wide Bore – [they all](https://boizoff.com/eartips_part_4/) fit and let you comfortably place the earphones in your ears. I never managed to settle on anything specific, as they all are fine.\n\nI can't say anything bad about SL224 in terms of user experience and ergonomics – they're just well-made modern in-ear headphones without any pitfalls. Of course, their black polished plastic surface scratches quickly and collects fingerprints, but that's how 99% of all headphones are made now, so there's nothing we can do. I can also complain about the case: for the earphones of this size and the cable of this length and thickness, this case is frankly small. Give me a bigger one now!\n\nAs for the electrical characteristics, the manufacturer claims a resistance of 36 Ω and a sensitivity of 108 dB. I can't comment on the second value, but I've recently become able to measure resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vktmk7topxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0087afee237e878d735e0bae6214e181dd579035\n\nIt varies from 34 to 14 Ω.\n\n# The sound\n\n*Standard links:*\n\n1. *the description of my rig is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/renovation-of-my-measuring-rig-for-headphones/)*;*\n2. *the audiogram of my hearing is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/audiogram/)*;*\n3. *articles on measurement theory and the whole shebang are* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/category/audiophile/theory/)*.*\n\nFrequency response of SLIIVO SL224 earphones with original foam eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hfl2191ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cea47660d534a586276350a062dc957e1a569d4\n\nAnd, before analyzing the frequency response, let me remind you that this frequency response will strongly depend on the depth of the fit. Frequency response of SL224 for the second resonance at 7000, 7500, 8000 and 8500 Hz:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lbyhjm2ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb404456030ce4a4c3f442905acc9d1c7a41284\n\nNote that there is no simple displacement of the resonant peak. On the contrary, the entire range from 3 to 20 kHz changes significantly, and only the emphasis at 12 kHz remains more or less stable in terms of volume and 'width', so to speak. The key thing that can be seen from these graphs is that the deeper the earphones are placed in the auditory canals, the lower the area before the second resonance 'droops' and the higher the peak rises around 15 kHz.\n\nComparison of frequency response for original foam and silicone eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg8uwbu4ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c2be14aaa3c3c99ba0cf535c6d00c6b7b3175bc\n\nAnyway, we can see the following on the graphs:\n\n* it seems to be a more or less typical sound delivery a la Harman;\n* but with reduced subbass;\n* and with a 'muffled', but rather 'smooth' 4-10 kHz segment;\n* as well as with an expansion after 10 kHz, the nature of which depends on the eartips. The graph obtained when using silicone eartips is more valid for my ears.\n\nBesides, consider a slight rise in the bass, about 250 Hz, as well as the shape of the 600 Hz to 3 kHz segment – it’s almost linear. We'll talk below how this affects the SL224 sound perception.\n\nNonlinear distortion at 94 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g2c9x48ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=031fd6a69ca193c02a48b3996e51ed689a3e213e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrc4ao19ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3afce27b77c8e94f80bfa77f522bdc0e82f1eec\n\nNonlinear distortion at 104 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_1.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_1.jpg)\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_2.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_2.jpg)\n\nThere's not much to comment on here: at 94 dB, the distortion is just over 0.5% at the maximum; at 104 dB volume, it's over 1%. That is, they have no audible effect on the sound.\n\nMinimum phase response, group delay, and spectrogram in the 'Burst decay' mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kxxdhfdppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbabddd9448e7feaa7bfba5bd9e255749fba11db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfq42o6eppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=258891b29d856b4a4102a1ee88176893e93ffc2b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jadpkhseppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e62b9f7e963ddeb411d1c3629b85179cc9f17a3\n\nIt's a common near-ideal pattern, typical for all modern in-ears of a similar price.\n\nMy subjective evaluation is that I'm blown away primarily by how full-fledged the SL224 sound delivery turned out to be. And I deliberately don't use the word 'balanced' because it refers to the concept of neutrality. Literally everything in the sound of these earphones is in place. All frequencies are exactly in the amount that my ear personally expects. There is a very, very weighty, but technical subbass, a 'close' articulated middle with a hearing-friendly range at about 6-8 kHz, and an airy lightness after 10 kHz. It's very difficult to describe this sound because it's 'correct' and 'tasty' at the same time. In other words, you definitely won't be able to complain about tonal inaccuracy as it's at a very high level, but you also have this feeling of a 'spectacular' sound. It's difficult for me to clearly connect this with measurement graphs, but I assume that it's the linear range of 600-3000 Hz (and here we can move on to an endless debate about how to correctly combine frequency response graphs for comparison), as well as some emphasis on ultra-high frequencies that speak for themselves.\n\nA standalone interesting quality of these earphones, which I really appreciate and which is relatively rare, is the instrument sound separation. It's just splendid. You can listen to each vocal line, percussion, each component of the track separately and distinguish its perception from the overall musical flow.\n\nMoreover, the width of the sound stage is clearly larger than average. SL224 play in a large-scale, airy manner, and the recording space noticeably lives and breathes. The music plays 'around your head' and even more or less from behind rather than between your ears.\n\nAs one would expect with such sound delivery, these earphones are very versatile in terms of suitable musical content. The only limitation, apart from your taste, is the quality of tracks. If a sound engineer has been careful about recording and processing of the high frequency area, everything will be fine. If they haven't, you will be hearing weird and unpleasant things.\n\n# Comparisons\n\nIf we compare within the price category, guided by the [best online rating of in-ear monitors](https://boizoff.com/language/en/the-best-iems/), then the following models will be next to SL224:\n\n* PULA ANVIL 114\n* Letshuoer Cadenza 4\n* Kiwi Ears Orchestra Lite.\n\nI have compared them, of course, up-close and personal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1p7xn3ippxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0934c4bb516dc35126dc0ced23e9d82aefefd3ec\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to ANVIL 114: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_ANVIL114.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_ANVIL114.png)\n\nWhen A/B-ing, ANVIL 114 fully justify their name, hitting the listener's ears with a steel hammer: this is a massive, 'fat' sound supported by a bone conduction driver against the rather neutral, 'elegant' SL224 sound delivery.\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Cadenza 4: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Cadenza\\_4.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Cadenza_4.png)\n\nCadenza 4 are an example of excellent 'light' headphones. Compared to SL224, they have more 'top' and less 'bottom' in almost identical proportions. The Cadenza 4's sound delivery is 'airier', lighter, 'sparklier', and they have a slightly smoother section after 10 kHz, while SL224, again, are more neutral and, therefore, more versatile in comparison.\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Orchestra Lite: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Orchestra\\_Lite.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Orchestra_Lite.png)\n\nWe love Orchestra Lite for their infinitely expressive 'middle'. It seems that Orchestra Lite deliver sound even 'closer' to the listener, and they're a little brighter if we evaluate the sound delivery by and large, but SL224 win in terms of reliability and 'punch'.\n\nIf we look at the SL224 tuning conceptually, so to speak, then we need to compare them with completely different earphones – [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/) and [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o78vvvipppxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ca90c5ee84b8406929c106d0d5555ef26ddc5b\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Meteor: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Meteor.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Meteor.png)\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Mega5-EST: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Mega5-EST.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Mega5-EST.png)\n\nAll three graphs compared:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mna3exppxf1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65aac9b4a17b9c969bac7fa6de31bcb38d5dc526\n\nCompared to Meteor, SL224 have a weightier bass and subbass due to a less pronounced middle; the Meteor sound seems sterile and faded against SL224. And, compared to Mega5-EST SL224, on the contrary, they're slightly less bassy, and the midrange is more pronounced. By ear, the SL224's sound delivery is almost perfectly equidistant from the tunings of these two models. The only thing that SL224 don't have is a smooth (by ear) frequency response after 10 kHz, which competitors can boast of. SL224 deliver this segment clearer, but less accurate. But prices vary accordingly, too.\n\nThe only aspect where I can name the best option for less money is gaming: from a positioning point of view, [KBEAR Cepheus](https://boizoff.com/language/en/kbear-cepheus-earphones-review/) remain unattainable and subjectively the best headphones for competitive games. But SL224 are also quite good in this context, don't get me wrong.\n\n# Summary\n\nI believe that the SL224's entry into the market is a significant milestone in the modern headphone industry. The SL224 is as iconic a model as [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/), [EPZ K9](https://boizoff.com/language/en/epz-k9-earphones-review/) or [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/) in their categories.\n\nAs for the sound… I'm willing to pay to see the first reaction to the SL224 sound of someone for whom these earphones will be the first or second under the sun, as the wow effect from their first listening is so intense, and they differ so much from 'just headphones' and any TWS. SL224 are tuned just superbly: their sound delivery is simultaneously engaging, especially if you turn up the volume, but also reliable and large-scale in the sense of a virtual sound stage.\n\nWho won't like them? 'Bassheads' and fans of listening to music in the conditions of high ambient noise, that is, on the streets of a big city (noise masking will reduce the sound of these headphones to medium and high frequencies only).\n\nTo buy or not to buy? To buy!",

    "title": "Aune N7 Class A Headphone Amp - Stunning Power and Value",
    "selftext": "Here's a trimmed down version of my full review over on head-fi. You can find it [here](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/aune-n7.28592/reviews).\n\n# Aune N7 Review — Mojo 2 Finds Its Match\n\nAfter upgrading to the Hifiman Arya Stealth, I wanted a proper Class A amp to bring out their full potential. I’ve long used the Chord Mojo 2 as my main DAC/amp — a brilliant device — but I suspected pairing it with a pure Class A amp might unlock something new. Enter the **Aune N7**.\n\n# Build & Design\n\nCompact, solid, and purposeful — the **N7**’s machined aluminum chassis with side heat fins looks serious and feels premium. The **volume knob** clicks smoothly but can skip if turned too fast. The **aluminum remote** feels fantastic, though its **volume buttons** could be better placed.  \nThe **display** is functional but small; no brightness control. As expected from a Class A amp, it runs warm — hand-warmer warm, not egg-frying hot. The internal temperature stays around 45°C even after long sessions.\n\n# Listening Setup\n\n**Chain:** Spotify Lossless → WiiM Mini → Mojo 2 → Aune N7 → Hifiman Arya Stealth (balanced out, high gain/high current).\n\n# Sound Impressions\n\n* **Steely Dan – “Aja”**: The N7 adds depth and weight, expanding the soundstage front-to-back. Bass gains texture; cymbals smooth out; the sax solo feels more alive. Some upper-mid sparkle is softened, but the trade-off is cohesion.\n* **Bill Evans Trio – “Sunday at the Village Vanguard”**: The sense of space and realism jumps. You don’t just hear LaFaro’s bass — you feel it resonate. Evans’ piano takes on body and warmth, and brushwork on the snare is wonderfully tactile.\n* **Snarky Puppy – “We Like It Here”**: A perfect showcase for the N7’s Class A dynamics. Everything stays tight and layered even in dense sections. You lose a touch of bite on transients, but gain richness and flow.\n* **Martha Argerich – Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3**: The Mojo alone is precise but dry. Add the N7 and the sound breathes — the piano has weight and the hall ambience comes alive.\n* **Entheogenic – “Dreamtime Physics”**: Electronica gains dimension and slam. Sub-bass digs deeper, highs shimmer smoothly, and the sound feels enveloping. The N7’s black background lets microdetails emerge effortlessly.\n\n# Tonal Character\n\nThe **N7** sits between **neutral and warm**, adding body without syrup. It turns the Mojo 2’s clinical precision into a more natural, organic presentation — like switching from a microscope to a beautifully developed photo. Mids are dense, bass tight, highs extended yet smooth.\n\n# Noise & Power\n\nAbsolutely silent, even at high gain. The Arya Stealth reaches satisfying levels around 10–15/30 volume steps, leaving plenty of headroom. Rated at **6.5W @ 32Ω balanced**, the N7 drives demanding planars effortlessly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe **Aune N7** is a **$399 Class A gem** — compact, powerful, and genuinely musical. It transforms the Mojo 2 from analytical to alive, and makes the Arya Stealth sound more organic and fatigue-free.  \nIf you want long, engaging sessions and real Class A smoothness without spending big or cluttering your desk, this is the one. Mine’s staying put — and that’s the best endorsement I can give.",

    "title": "In the market: DCA Noire XO or E3?",
    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI know the question is odd since it's a open vs closed back DCA, however I am in the market for a new set. For my listening tastes, my 6XX doesn't cut it. I then got a planar FT1 Pro and the widened soundstage is nice, but I hate certain aspects of the headphones (including the stock pads and putting on some Dekoni LCD-type pads certainly changed the headphones too much) and I find it really sounds bad when I drive them with EQ that brings it closer to Harman. The dips I can hear in 2K-5K is very annoying to try and EQ properly and I haven't been able to make it right with the new pads; they're either distant or very grating.\n\nConversly, I noticed that once I tuned my 6XX's close to Harman using ortary's EQ, I vastly enjoyed the sound more, but the technical aspects of the 6XX's were starting to bug me, like the lack of Impact of bass and the narrow soundstage,\n\nHence my look into DCA's more Harman tuned headphones. I have heard very good things about E3, namely that it has a vast sound-stage for a closed back, large drivers/earcups (I do have a big fuggin head), etc. etc. However, now that I see that the Noire XO is out for several hundred less, I am also looking at these, namely on DMS' recommendation and his bit about \"if you LPF after 10k, you effectively get E3\". Pair the Noire XO's promising looking bass response, I am at a bit of a decision paralysis between the two for an end-game desktop setup.\n\nSo, for people that have listened to one or the other, is the E3 worth it for the extra money vs the Noire XO in your own personal opinion? What about for someone like myself that wants a more Harman tuned, wider soundstage headphone? It's one thing to say \"has a wide soundstage for a closed back\", but then how does it compare to an actual open back in the Noire XO?\n\nThanks! :)\n\ne; I also don't live anywhere near a place to test each.",

However, I am experiencing some extremely harsh, sharp and painful kind of sibilance to some vocals on some tracks. For example from 1:43-1:55 on Duckworth by Kendrick Lamar. This happens mostly on s-sounds.\n\nI found that I had to meticulously EQ around 9800 Hz (q factor of 3), reducing it by around 6-7 dB in order to get rid of this painful sound. However, I find that doing this makes the overall sound more dull, dark and less defined. I'm not sure what to do. Measurement of the AR5000's frequency response shows a big peak at around 9500 Hz, could this perhaps be why? I did not see Resolve mention this problem in his review of the headphones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/undw3zt1kpxf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c527c80ede8fe7708253b26ec1c84e2adf4e1f8\n\nI have a pair of airpods pro 2 that i have no problems with. No painful sharp vocals.\n\nIs this a common problem among people? And is having to perform such a big EQ change even acceptable?  \nAm i experiencing this because I have a weird HRTF?  \nPerhaps any owners of the AR5000 that can give their thoughts and experience with this?",

    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

Loved how clear and Fun everything sounded to me and thus learned more about sound in general. Then I got some Kz iems, liked it and switch over to the Letshouer S12, but then my m4's broke. So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

But upon sitting at demo area, having exchanged a few pleasantries with the staff, their attitude quickly changed.

Oh. Yeah, ok.\", \"Pick something else then.\"\n\nIt's not even just what they say or don't say, but it's how they say it. They really made me feel like they didn't want my business. Oddly they would only ever respond if you asked about the price.

I'd like to enter an enthusiast store and meet other enthusiasts who actually care and want to share their love of audio. \n\nIf the staff are so uninterested then they should just work at Harvey Norman or JB HiFi where customers actually don't want to engage the staff. \n\nI'm an experienced audiophile with a fairly deep appreciation and budget. I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment. The local audiophile circle feel the same way and have since chosen to bring their business to Minidisc instead. ",

My set is: \n\n• Grado RS2x \n• HiFiman Subdara (2020)\n• Schiit Vali 2++\n• Schiit Modi\n\nI’ve had the Grados for a couple of years now and every time I use them it reminds me why i got into this “hobby” in the first place. Absolutely gorgeous in the mid range and with a little EQ (+3db at 100hz) the bass feels a bit more full. What floors me about the RS2x’s is how natural instruments sound with them. Jazz, rock—pretty much anything with actual instruments sounds incredible. Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can’t imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these. They’re far from neutral but if you like the way they color music Grados are some of the best cans. After 15+ years of experience with their headphones I feel like I have “arrived” with these and my modest budget audiophile set up. \n\nThe HiFimans are a delight as well. Far more neutral, but man can they be EQed. No distortion with any level of reasonable EQ on the bass so if I want to put on some electronic music and blast some chunky thick bass directly into my brain, these are the cans to do it. While I definitely use the Grados more, these are an amazing second set to have at my desk for when I listen to music that the Grados aren’t well suited for. (Not that other music sounds /bad/ on them, it’s just not what they excel at.)\n\nNone of my friends are big into audio and they’ve heard me rant about my cans probably more times they can count so I thought I’d dump my thoughts and adoration of my set up here. \n\nFeel free to share your desktop set up’s as well I’d love to see what other people are working with, gear-wise. \n",

The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it’s Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth’s do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it’s a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it’s very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn’t too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren’t for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can’t wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now.

    "selftext": "So, in the \"I'm Exploring the World\" column, I decided to listen to something other than electrostatic there must be other headphones out there, right?\n\nI thought I should try a TOTL of dynamic and planar headphones.\n\nSo, I found the\n\n* Sennheiser HD800/HD800S\n* and Focal Utopia 2022\n* and Hifiman Susvara OG\n\nLet's start with the Hifiman Susvara. Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones. I'd certainly like to hear the top-end Sony R10s or something like the Spirit Torino Valkyria and there are plenty of planar headphones out there..",

    "selftext": "A few days ago, I decided to get into EQing and came across Equalizer APO with Peace. After following some guides and videos, I managed to set everything up successfully.\n\nI then applied Oratory’s EQ profile for the Sennheiser HD560S ([link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vjyepkimg31sb2tjpprnl/Sennheiser-HD560S.pdf?rlkey=fei2h8kkt2qda6rc6f9qf69ti&e=2&dl=0)). The issue I’m facing now is that while the volume in Windows (YouTube/Spotify) sounds fine, the in-game audio becomes very quiet when using this EQ profile, even at max volume.\n\nOratory suggests increasing amplifier gain, but I don’t currently have an amp, just my motherboard driving the 560S. After checking some Reddit threads, I made a shortlist of potential DAC/amp options, but I’m unsure which one would best solve the issue and remain future-proof (in case I switch to something like IEMs or Beyerdynamics later).\n\nHere are the options I’m considering (considering I am EU based):\n\n* FiiO K11\n* FiiO K5 Pro\n* Topping DX3 Pro+\n* FX-Audio DAC-X6 Mini HiFi 2.0\n* Fosi Audio Q4\n* Any other alternative that I might have missed and is better than the above ones\n\nP.S. don't go too hard on me, I am all new to EQ and DACs/AMPs.",

    "title": "Lets talk about the new Edition XV",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/it1hxzzqlrxf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=5912a58e06d71ad339cda4f905209e4b1052edb0\n\nI compared a few headphones a couple of days ago, and a lot of people wanted to hear more about the Edition XV. So let’s talk about it.\n\nAmong all the headphones I’ve listened to, the closest one might be the Fiio FT1 Pro. The moment I put the Edition XV on, I instantly felt this warmth spreading through me — like being wrapped in honey. You’ll know what I mean once you try it.\n\n**Bass (before & after eq using oratory 1990's, the EQ didn't change the conclusion below)**\n\nThe most distinctive thing about the Edition XV, to my ears, is its **meaty bass**. It’s thick, elastic, and feels like it’s hugging the sides of your ears. It’s not the fast, clean kind of bass you get from the HE600. It’s the wet, creamy kind — like your ears are being gently massaged with a cloth soaked in oil.\n\nThe bass also has more layers than the FT1 Pro, but the FT1 Pro’s bass FEELS more aggressive. It’s like a scholar delivering an insult — refined, yet every word cuts deep. There’s more nuance and subtlety here, unlike the FT1 Pro, which just lashes out bluntly. Naturally, this makes the Edition XV sound a bit less aggressive at first. But if you listen closely, the impact is still there — it just feels smoother and more full-bodied.\n\nThat said, not everyone listens critically all the time. When I’m just relaxing, I sometimes *feel* like the FT1 Pro has more bass (even though that’s not actually true if you listen critically when A/B them). I just want to bring this up because sometimes people would only describe stuff in their critical listening sessions, but headphones could feel VERY  different in daily casual listening.\n\n**Mids**\n\nNow, the mids. Vocals on the Edition XV are closer and more intimate than typical Hifiman models like the Arya Stealth or Edition XS, but still a bit farther away than on the FT1 Pro. The voice is rich, full, and slightly nasal. For female vocals, the singer can sound about ten years older than she actually is. That’s not necessarily good or bad — it’s all down to taste.\n\nThe vocals lean on the darker side. Compared to the FT1 Pro, they’re more refined but also smoother — which means you lose some of that raw texture in the voice, like the growls in the rock music. Personally, I prefer the FT1 Pro’s vocal texture; it carries more emotion like anger or passion. The Arya Stealth also feels more emotional than the Edition XV, but for a different reason — it has more treble, more air, and that shimmer in the highs makes the vocals feel alive and vibrant. (You know those highs that vibrate with your skulls?)\n\nStill, the Edition XV has its own charm. A lot of 80s and 90s tracks — songs like city pop — take on a totally different vibe here. In fact, I’d describe the Edition XV as a **vibe** in itself. You know those days when you’re tired of all the crap and just want to chill, wrapped in a soft blanket, hugging a pillow? That’s what the Edition XV feels like. It won’t shock you, it won’t thrill you — it just gives you that warm, steady, safe harbor you want to come home to.\n\n**Treble**\n\nThe treble is soft — no sibilance, no sting. The FT1 Pro is more exciting in this area, which is why I think it’s the better all-rounder. The Edition XV, though, owns its signature mood completely.\n\n**Others**\n\nAs for soundstage — the Edition XV’s lateral stage is narrower than its front-to-back depth. Sometimes the sound on both sides feels smeared onto a flat plane beside your ears, kind of vibrating there, which feels a bit unnatural. The FT1 Pro’s stage is even smaller, but it doesn’t have that issue.\n\nOverall, the Edition XV definitely has better detail retrieval and imaging than the FT1 Pro.\n\n**I wouldn't use a \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this headphone, since it is so special in the Hifiman lineup that I don't think there is any other hifiman headphone that can be compared with it. It is its own vibe, and if you can vibe with it, then it can probably beat those far more expensive headphones for you. If you can't (for example, you really enjoy other Hifiman lineups), it's really hard to say if you would enjoy it as much as others do.**\n\nHere is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1odsod7/comparison_between_he600_edition_xv_edition_xs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from a couple of days ago if you want to know more about my preference in sounds.",

    "selftext": "These have supplanted the Sennheiser HD6xx as my favorite open back and the one I use daily. The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else. I would be perfectly happy with these as my open back and Aeon Closed RT as my closed back for the forseeable future.",

I play rarely ps5 (most time for exclusive titels, like Yotei) and super rarely online on ps5 so I need ps+ only for Arc Raiders. I played a lot of Singleplayer games via chiaki last year but dont know if its a good idea to play multiplayer because of delay on streaming.\n\nSo Im interested in your opinion whats the better choice. Also I want to know if someone tried the game docked on the Steam Deck via TV and how it runs. Graphics are not that important for me, but i hope its not a total mess docked. Want to play 80% on Handheld and 20% on big screen.",

I recall even any wired headphones would disable the internal mic, and this was a \"hardware limitation\" that couldn't be updated.  \n\n\nWas this somehow updated as a workaround? \nEdit: Some more testing, a 3 channel connection keeps the internal mic active, however a 2 channel connection disables the internal mic! How is this possible?  \n\n\nI use USB earbuds sometimes, and that works well too. My AUX headset is just very comfortable and high quality, but I'm just confused that this hardware limitation seems to have flipped on me after all these years.",

Recently, I decided to completely reinstall/remod my New Vegas using Viva New Vegas as a base. I had a bit of difficulty getting MO2 reinstalled, but all I had to do was update Protontricks and wine and I had it running. \n\nBut today is very different. Firstly, somehow, my FalloutNV.exe file just disappeared from my install folder? And after verifying the integrity of the game files, MO2 no longer loaded up. No big deal, we'll just reinstall it. \n\nNow, MO2 fails at the very end, when it's configuring the game prefix. This is the same problem I had previously before updating Wine/Protontricks, but this time they're both up to date (as far as I know)? I've tried redownloading the MO2 Linux installer multiple times, tried completely uninstalling/reinstalling my New Vegas multiple times, and tried restarting my Steam Deck. I have no idea what the issue is and I'm very frustrated.\n\nCould it be that I saved a few folders from my previous (working) MO2 folder? I saved the plugins, mods, and profiles folder because I didn't want to restart from scratch with over 300 mods.",

My Steam Deck suddenly stopped working last night.\n\n\n\n# The Problem:\n\n\n\nI was playing a game (*The Walking Dead*), put the Deck into **Sleep Mode**, and when I tried to wake it up, the screen remained black and it wouldn't boot.\n\n\n\n# Chronological Order\n\n\n\n1. **Initial State:** When pressing the power button, the screen remained black, and the **white power LED would flash exactly 3 times** before turning off completely. I tried this multiple times.\n2. **Troubleshooting Attempts:** I followed all standard troubleshooting steps:\n   * Hard reset (holding the power button for 15 seconds).\n   * Attempting to enter the BIOS/Boot Manager (Volume Up + Power).\n3. **Current State (Critical Failure):** After these attempts, the Deck is now **completely unresponsive**.\n   * Pressing the power button does nothing.\n   * **Crucially, when I connect the original charger, the LED next to the USB-C port does NOT light up.** It is not accepting a charge.\n\n\n\n# Context \n\nI understand this is a critical hardware failure (likely the battery circuit or motherboard), but I have a concern regarding support. **I bought the Deck second-hand a few months ago, and it has worked flawlessly until now.**\n\n**My questions for the community are:**\n\n1. Has anyone experienced the exact sequence of the **3 white LED flashes** followed by the Deck completely dying (no power/no charging LED)?\n2. What was your experience with Valve support for a critical hardware failure? Did they require the original proof of purchase (even if the serial number is still under warranty)?\n\nI have already prepared a support ticket for Valve, but any personal experience or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

    "title": "Fallout 4 VR kinda works on steam deck",
    "selftext": "Okay, so my last post I described how SkyrimVR works really well on the deck. Well I promised you all that I was going to test Fallout 4 VR on the deck. Here are my results. It’s more work than SkyrimVR and requires more setup.\n\nSo initially it ran like absolute garbage. Barely playable, maybe if i had no other way of playing it, I could put up with it, but I have strong VR Legs. Performance is abysmal and casual players will suffer with it. Begin by lowering all the settings within the performance menu of Fallout 4 VR. \n\nTurn off anti aliasing, shadow distance to low and everything else as low as possible. This will make performance somewhat tolerable. Next step is your resolution settings which are by far the most important when considering performance/FPS of the game.\nYou don’t change this in the ini file but in steamVR itself. So I have a quest 1. The resolution is about 1400x1600 natively. \n\nSo I set mine to slightly below that. This gives a massive increase to performance. If you don’t mind pixelation then you can easily achieve playable FPS by going to your steamVR settings and changing it to as low as you can. Obviously most people will struggle though as it can become pretty blurry at that point. \n\nI don’t think this is the end though. \nYou can install mods manually by extracting them to the game directory. So I installed insignificant object remover and then added it to the plugins file manually.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of work so here is what I did.\n\nI browsed to the fallout 4 VR Install directory which is where the ini files are installed and manually added those mod files to the plugins.txt file.\n\nI know from windows it is usually located in the “appdata/fallout 4” \nIt didn’t exist for me so I created the plugins.txt file and added the file name of the mod I had extracted manually.\n\nSo copy the name of the ESP file and add a star in front of it. So * then name of installed mod file. Each file name should be one line then press enter if you wish to add another mod underneath. You need to add each mod to a separate line. \n\nUsually on a normal modded fallout 4 install this is done automatically by the mod menu or mod manager in game. Since we are working outside the bounds we will have to do this manually. \nOnce that is done launch the game.\n\nI changed my resolution to 20% as I have a quest 1 and it ran. \n\nPersonally my FPS wasn’t too good. It was pixelated and felt horrid. Even as a person with strong VR legs it was hard to stomach. \nThis is my first attempt though and I have no doubt that if I installed FPS Mods correctly and tweaked the ini settings I can get this game stable. \n\nNow judging from my experience in flat Fallout 4 modding on low spec systems, I know that you can lower texture resolutions for huge performance increases. There are multiple mods on the nexus to achieve this result but unfortunately I didn’t test this out.\n\nI 100% know that if I was to install lower resolution mods, disable shadows and other effects I could achieve a high FPS but I didn’t go that far (yet), but I know it’s possible. \n\nTLDR: it’s completely possible to run fallout 4 VR on the steam deck. There are many guides on setting up vortex on steam deck and if you can do that you can achieve playable frame rates. I haven’t set it up personally (not yet anyway)\n\nSo many naysayers are going to tell you how fallout 4 VR will never perform playable on the DECK. This is bullshit.\nPeople like to talk about things they haven’t tried. I’ve tested this game and I think if you put enough effort in you can get it playable.\n\nPersonally I could play it with vanilla settings even with the lower FPS. But I know from my experience with modding flat Fallout 4 that with ini tweaks and downgrading the texture resolution and draw distances, this game can be made completely VR capable the deck. The great thing about the creation/gamebyro engine is it is versatile.\n\nI will make a new thread soon when I get it running better. If you are like me and have no other way of experiencing fallout 4 VR (with only a steam deck) then I suggest you hang tight as this is a solvable issue.\n\nI haven’t even touched upon the GPD Win sized texture pack, the downgraded ini files or the load acceleration mods.\n\nIt is possible but for now, we are at the first step. \n\n",

The weird thing is the internal microphone stays active regardless if something is plugged in or not. I recall even any wired headphones would disable the internal mic, and this was a \"hardware limitation\" that couldn't be updated.  \n\n\nWas this somehow updated as a workaround? \nEdit: Some more testing, a 3 channel connection keeps the internal mic active, however a 2 channel connection disables the internal mic! How is this possible?  \n\n\nI use USB earbuds sometimes, and that works well too. My AUX headset is just very comfortable and high quality, but I'm just confused that this hardware limitation seems to have flipped on me after all these years.",

Recently, I decided to completely reinstall/remod my New Vegas using Viva New Vegas as a base. I had a bit of difficulty getting MO2 reinstalled, but all I had to do was update Protontricks and wine and I had it running. \n\nBut today is very different. Firstly, somehow, my FalloutNV.exe file just disappeared from my install folder? And after verifying the integrity of the game files, MO2 no longer loaded up. No big deal, we'll just reinstall it. \n\nNow, MO2 fails at the very end, when it's configuring the game prefix. This is the same problem I had previously before updating Wine/Protontricks, but this time they're both up to date (as far as I know)? I've tried redownloading the MO2 Linux installer multiple times, tried completely uninstalling/reinstalling my New Vegas multiple times, and tried restarting my Steam Deck. I have no idea what the issue is and I'm very frustrated.\n\nCould it be that I saved a few folders from my previous (working) MO2 folder? I saved the plugins, mods, and profiles folder because I didn't want to restart from scratch with over 300 mods.",

    "title": "New lighting setup questions",
    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\n\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\n\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

Thus, any occupancy sensor can turn on the stairwell lights and when all sensors have turned off the lights for the stairwell turn off. However, I'd like this to be on a scheduled routine whereby at night time the lights either come on or preferably come on very dimly. Would anyone have any suggestions on products that might achieve this? If need be I would certainly set up a Home Assistant server to accommodate this project. I set up a home assistant server a few years ago but couldn't quite justify keeping it in place as I didn't have the need at the time. But this would push me over this threshold should it be necessary. Thanks for your guidance!\n\nPs this would also work great in a residential bathroom: occupancy sensors and bathrooms are great except when it's the middle of the night!",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5).

NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea.

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m setting up automation in my new apartment (about 65 sqm) and would love some advice on where to start.\n\nMy plan is quite simple — I’d like to have:\n- A couple of smart socket relays\n- A few motion/presence sensors\n- Automated curtains (I’ll use Somfy for that)\n\nI don’t want anything too complex like Home Assistant, since I won’t have too many scenes or devices. Ideally, I’d like to avoid having several different hubs.\n\nI noticed that the new Echo Dot Max has a built-in smart hub supporting Zigbee, Matter, and Thread Border Router.\nIf I understand correctly, does this mean I wouldn’t need any additional hubs, and I could connect different Zigbee or Matter devices directly to Alexa?\n\nIs the Echo Dot Max good choice as smart home hub? Is Alexa a good choice for simple automation setups?\n\nWhich protocol would you recommend — Matter, Zigbee?\n\nAny recommendations for socket relays and motion/presence sensors that work well with Alexa?\n\nThanks in advance for any tips or personal experiences!",

But I'm also going through a lot of big life changes right now that having a little help from an at home assistant type device would be super helpful where I can just tell it a thing and it will remind me or add it to other devices and stuff like that. I'm also getting some home security stuff (free through my internet provider), but being able to connect all that stuff together or having all the devices stuff connected to my phone & the Alexa would be so helpful and maybe help me understand some of it a bit better. I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

    "title": "Reverse-engineering DPS 101 on LEDVANCE Tuya RGBIC lamp - unknown LED indices cause device reboot",
    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\n\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\n\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5).

NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

    "title": "Smart Curtain Motor help? Motor specs or modificaitons for 16/2 Low-Voltage Power cable?",
    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\n\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\n\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

But this would push me over this threshold should it be necessary. Thanks for your guidance!\n\nPs this would also work great in a residential bathroom: occupancy sensors and bathrooms are great except when it's the middle of the night!",

I like to sleep cold, but enjoy getting up with a moderately warm room. \n\nI already have a fan that turns off about 30 minutes to an hour before I wake up, which is nice. The thing I'm looking for is a way for my door to be closed as well. (I don't have a window, the door leads to a small balcony). I noticed there are a number of products that allow for automation when it comes to allowing pets through or manual opening and closing, but none that include a timer. Am I just being blind and missing them or do they not exist? \n\nIf anyone has a solution, I would love to hear it! (Sleeping in a warm room is not an option)",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5).

NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there.

I can do all of the other bits but translating from these 2 wires to something else seems to be breaking my brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrjye1zgvxf1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=72379c7a66a60690a24cd86633780ac3f8fb97d8\n\n",

    "selftext": "3200sqft home, 2 story and single zone. Bedroom is on upper floor, living area is downstairs. Thermostat is on the bottom floor. No filters or humidifiers or anything else in the system. We currently have a gen 1 nest, which they just dropped support for and no longer works with the app. We are in the Apple ecosystem. The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit? Looking at the ecobee and the nest, but not sure if either one will give us an advantage with our current setup.\n\nThoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

My question is what Hub has the most connectivity options to make sure I can get as many things talking as possible.\n\nThe options I can see that would work are\n\nAqara M3 - Seems like a solid all round option with matterr and Zigbee support\n\nAqara s1+ - this seems to require the M3 hub for matter support but also looks super clean and seems to support HA\n\nHome assistant Green - Not to sure on this but it seems to be an Rpi that works as a hub?\n\n,",

Can anyone suggest a solution? I reached out to the manufacturer and they are shipping a replacement circuit board. Hopefully that fixes it, but could there be a problem with the circuit?

The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said “no” and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nAs winter is quickly moving in, we’re struggling to find a heater that actually keeps our shed warm without destroying our electric bill.\n\nWe’ve tried a Pro Breeze mini heater (500W) - it did the job okay for a few weeks when it wasn’t too cold, but now it barely makes a difference.\n\nWe switched to a Dreo smart electric heater (1500W) which works great for heat, but it absolutely drains electricity.\n\nThe heater needs to be on from around 4PM to 10AM, and we’ve got them both set up on Tapo smart plugs so they turn on/off automatically on schedule.\n\nThe ideal temp needs to stay between 15C and 24C.\n\nThe shed is insulated to a degree, but clearly not enough for the small heater to handle the cold now.\n\nAny recommendations for an efficient heater that can keep a small/medium shed warm without guzzling power?\nBonus points if it’s something we can still use with a smart plug or thermostat.\n\nThanks in advance. Any suggestions (or even setup tips) would be massively appreciated!",

Not after battery changes, just randomly. Over time one of my indoor sensors has become completely undetectable.\n\nI'm looking to upgrade but honestly I'm not very impressed with my Grovee experience. Maybe I just bought the wrong model? There seem to be so many different options of Grovee set ups, some of which have been talked about here but I'm afraid of a repeat performance from a new Grovee set up. Is there a better option out there? What have you been using and for how long?\n\nMy Desires:\n\n- Amazon Alexa (I would like to be able to link to Alexa so I can ask temp/humidity of certain sensors)\n- Android Widget Option\n- Less than $200 for set up (5 sensors preferred)",

Thank you all so much, I really appreciate this community so much. \n\n\n\nHi all, thank you in advance for any insight you can provide.\n\n**Prior to our issues:** we have a Google Home and multiple brands/types of smart devices. All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

I don't want this. \n\nDoes anyone have a recommendation for a main and satellite smart dimmer switch kit, which works has a \"slider\" function instead of tiny buttons to mash a bunch?\n\nIf it matters, I use Alexa assistant. \n\nI ended up going with [this Meross](https://a.co/d/dYV7SwZ) kit, since it can dim at both the main and traveler end AND isn't the tiny buttons the Kasa has.

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you’ve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn’t a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance — and if you’ve built something like this, I’d love to see your setup!",

    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "title": "Dark Apartment - need ideas / solutions",
    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I have a very simple heater my garage with an old-school thermostat.  I need to integrate this and have a Zooz Zen16 \"dry contact\" Multirelay to use but am unclear on how to actually wire the heater into this.  I have separate power inputs into the unit which is solved but I have 2 wires from the unit which don't make sense to me on how to connect them.  I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?  I can do all of the other bits but translating from these 2 wires to something else seems to be breaking my brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrjye1zgvxf1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=72379c7a66a60690a24cd86633780ac3f8fb97d8\n\n",

    "selftext": "3200sqft home, 2 story and single zone. Bedroom is on upper floor, living area is downstairs. Thermostat is on the bottom floor. No filters or humidifiers or anything else in the system. We currently have a gen 1 nest, which they just dropped support for and no longer works with the app. We are in the Apple ecosystem. The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit? Looking at the ecobee and the nest, but not sure if either one will give us an advantage with our current setup.\n\nThoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

Can anyone suggest a solution? I reached out to the manufacturer and they are shipping a replacement circuit board. Hopefully that fixes it, but could there be a problem with the circuit?

I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said “no” and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

Also Wowsers at like fifty plus dollars that’s an expensive option. \n\n\nI’m needing to replace light switch, I have Alexa, Smarthings, Apple, UniFi and more with entry door and garage door open/closed sensor in a house ten or so years old. \n\n\nWhat am I missing what would people suggest…??\n\n\n\n",

Not after battery changes, just randomly. Over time one of my indoor sensors has become completely undetectable.\n\nI'm looking to upgrade but honestly I'm not very impressed with my Grovee experience. Maybe I just bought the wrong model? There seem to be so many different options of Grovee set ups, some of which have been talked about here but I'm afraid of a repeat performance from a new Grovee set up. Is there a better option out there?

    "title": "Smart home Setup - internet issues",
    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "title": "Dark Apartment - need ideas / solutions",
    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

I need to integrate this and have a Zooz Zen16 \"dry contact\" Multirelay to use but am unclear on how to actually wire the heater into this.  I have separate power inputs into the unit which is solved but I have 2 wires from the unit which don't make sense to me on how to connect them.  I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?

No filters or humidifiers or anything else in the system. We currently have a gen 1 nest, which they just dropped support for and no longer works with the app. We are in the Apple ecosystem. The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit? Looking at the ecobee and the nest, but not sure if either one will give us an advantage with our current setup.\n\nThoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

Can anyone suggest a solution? I reached out to the manufacturer and they are shipping a replacement circuit board. Hopefully that fixes it, but could there be a problem with the circuit?

So I thought I'd ask here and maybe one of you know and has some insight?!\n\nI'm looking for a doorbell that is connected to an electrical outlet/electricity and that also has battery as a backup in case there is a power outage.\n\nThis doorbell should be connected to wifi and should also have 4g/5g as a backup in case the wifi stops working due to, for example, a power outage.\n\nThis doorbell should have a high-quality camera and there should be an app for this doorbell.\n\n(Extra question is, this doorbell, can the person knocking/ringing see if the doorbell camera is being used? For example, a courier/carrier rings on my doorbell. I open the app to see who is ringing. Can the courier/carrier see that I am using the camera on my doorbell to see who is ringing or not?)\n\nDoes anyone here know which company or brand offers and sells this type of doorbell that I am looking for?\n\nAs I said, I have looked around and it is complicated, so I really appreciate any help I can get!",

    "selftext": "Hi, I need some advice please.  I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

    "selftext": "There must be a way to fix this. I just replaced a years old Nest Hello (wired) doorbell camera with a new Nest wired 3rd Gen doorbell.  The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said “no” and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI recently bought a QD-OLED monitor to use as my main monitor with 2 regular monitors on the sides of it. It’s my first OLED monitor and so to make sure I don’t have burn in issues I set Windows to put the monitors to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. Note: I did not set the whole PC to go to sleep, only the monitors.\n\nBut I’m having an issue. The monitors seem to take longer than the specified amount of time to go to sleep. For example I just timed it and from the moment I stopped using the mouse and keyboard it took 22 minutes for the monitors to go to sleep rather than the set 15 minutes. It seems to always take a random amount of extra time for the monitors to go to sleep.\n\nHowever when I set Windows to put the monitors to sleep after just 1 minute for testing purposes it usually works fine. But as soon as I set it back to like 10 or 15 minutes it takes longer again.\n\nI did do some googling and ran the command “powercfg /requests” in an admin terminal and this was the output https://imgur.com/a/9oUCHWE\n\nI’m not sure if one of those things under the System section or Discord may be causing it to not work properly? But I would’ve thought if one of those were the issue then the monitors would never go to sleep rather than the issue I’m having.\n\nThe other thing I’ve done is disable Nvidia High Defintion Audio in device manager cause that was completely preventing the monitors from going to sleep.\n\nHoping someone can help me figure this out! TIA\n\n",

One time on my laptop i noticed that on the little window where you can connect to WiFi, Bluetooth, enable Airplane modea and bunch of other thing, the WiFi little window just dissapired and with that the chance of connecting to my WiFi, but this wasn´t a big problem because i have Ethernet connected all the time so I just left it, later I find out I needed to reInstall the WiFi driver (or something like that) and then it was all good until it happened again but same problem same result. \n\nToday the same thing happened with Bluetooth. That is a little bigger problem bc. I am using it everyday for headphones or somethimes controller. I tried the standart Win help and nothing usefull, I tried restarting pc  that didnt work so now I am with no Wifi (but with Ethernet) and Bluetooth. \n\nCan somebody help? \n\nAtleast with the Bluetooth (to WiFi not working got used) ",

    "selftext": "# I have a GTX 1050 and just got a 3rd monitor which means I am forced to use the DisplayPort slot. The monitor is hdmi only and I have tried two different DisplayPort TO HDMI connectors (I have double and triple checked they are both the right way round, one was an adaptor that plugged into a HDMI cable into the monitor and the other was a direct DP to HDMI cable). The PC recognises the monitor in settings but always says no signal on the monitor, unless I change the monitors resolution in NVIDIA control panel to 1080i rather than 1080p, in which cases I get a blurry and jittery image which blacks out periodically. Anyone know what the issue is likely to be? I suspect I need a better cable but wanted to check before I paid more for one.\n\nSo far I have tried:  \n\\- unplugging pc and or monitor for 1+ minutes and then reconnecting  \n\\- windows + ctrl + shift + b to reset graphics  \n\\- messing with windows P  \n\\- plugging the monitor straight into my hdmi port: works but the monitor already in hdmi doesn't work plugged into the DP",

However, I need to run some engineering software for my studies, for privacy reasons, as well as the requirement for the software to be connected to my university's VPN I will would like to set this up within a VM. \n\nI know KVM/QEMU is going to be the best solution to this but from what I've heard there are a bunch of other tweaks I could do with making to achieve the best performance and for GPU passthrough. Any advice on what to do for this and where to go would be great, thanks.\n\n  \nFor context I have a laptop with both an intel iGPU and an Nvidia GPU. The laptop has tonnes of RAM and Storage so I can give the VM a lot of both without any issues. ",

When I play a song directly from Apple Music on the phone, it is played through the speaker. So the connection between phone and speaker is OK. \n\nWhen I set an alarm in the “clock” app, the selected sound is played on my phone, but is *not* played through the speaker. (The alarm sound I chose is from the standard set that comes with the phone.)\n\nIf I select a song as the alarm sound, my music library (same library as the one used by Apple Music) opens so I can choose a song. When the alarm goes off, it also does *not* play through the speaker, although it does play on the phone. \n\nThe weak link seems to be the clock app. I looked for the clock app in the settings app to see if there’s a setting for playing on a remote speaker, but I did not find it. \n\nCan anyone tell me how to fix this? I’m hard of hearing, and my phone is simply not loud enough to wake me up, even if I use the loudest song or sound as the alarm. That’s one reason I bought the speaker, so i can wake up reliably. \n\nThank you!",

But I'm trying to plan a trip, and need a group chat all of us to communicate, both before for pre-planning and on the actually trip. About half the group chat will be android, and on the trip, there may be spotty data and no wifi, which I feel like always messes up an apple/android group chat even more. I have an iPhone 11, but of course the other people's phones are wide range. I think the androids are mostly Samsung, not sure though. \n\nIt would be a simply solution for us to communicate on a third party app, which I like the idea of. I like that we could name the chat, and that we could add/drop members, since it's still a little in the air who can come on the trip. I'm comfortable with GroupMe, and I've used WhatsApp a little bit. BUT, other people in the group have said that they don't want to use a third party app.\n\nSo my question is, is there a messaging app out there that lets some members use the app, and others use their normal messaging on their phone? or at least will make the groupchat smoother? I guess it might work like an extension to normal messages.",

During setup, it detects my Google Drive backup but shows this message:\n\n>\n\nThe backup is **still visible in Google Drive**, so it definitely exists. I tried everything — same phone number, same Gmail account, strong Wi-Fi, reinstalling multiple times, enough storage, and even another phone — but nothing works.\n\nAfter finishing setup, there are **no chats at all — no groups, no personal messages — it looks completely blank like a new account**, even though the Drive backup is still there.\n\nThese messages are very important to me.

    "selftext": "**SITUATION**  \nMy PC would frequently reboot. Specifically, 1) the screen would go black, 2) audio would continue for a moment, 3) the PC would reboot. It seemed to be related to the load on my GeForce 4070, as I could often trigger a reboot by trying to open a ton of media-intensive applications such as Discord, Firefox, and Steam, but these reboots would also occur during periods in which I was innocuously using File Explorer.\n\nEvent Viewer and analyzing the dump files pointed to bugcheck 0x0116 stemming from a nvlddmkm.sys issue. I tried many solutions, and none worked until I looked more closely at my HWMonitor stats. I saw that my \\[PCIe PEX errors recovery counter\\] would increment steadily upon boot. This suggested a hardware-level instability or signal integrity issue on the PCIe link. With this info, I found a fix to stop the inadvertent, frequent rebooting. I wanted to share this in case it helps others.\n\n**SPECS**\n\n>**Motherboard:** Asus ROG STRIX B550-I GAMING Mini ITX AM4  \n**CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 3.8 GHz 8-Core  \n**GPU:** GALAX GeForce RTXTM 4070 Super 12GB, GDDR6X  \n**Case:** Asus Prime AP201 MicroATX Mini Tower  \n**Power Supply:** Corsair SF850L 850 W 80+  \n**Primary Storage:** Western Digital Blue 2 TB 2.5\" SSD  \n**RAM:** Corsair Vengeance LPX 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3600 CL18  \n**OS:** Windows 11 Pro\n\n**SOLUTION**\n\nThis solution worked for my NVIDIA GeForce RTXTM 4070 Super. If you have another brand, you cannot follow all the steps for how I fixed it.\n\n1. Reboot to BIOS/UEFI settings.\n2. Change the PCIe generation from \\[Auto\\] to \\[Gen 3\\]. This can potentially result in a minor loss of performance in order to improve signal integrity.\n   1. Depending on your motherboard, this is typically found under \"Advanced,\" \"Chipset Configuration,\" or \"PCIe Subsystem Settings\". If you're struggling, enter \\[your motherboard brand\\] + \"how to change PCIe to gen 3\" into your browser. Follow those steps.\n3. Exit and boot to Windows.\n4. Open NVIDIA Control Panel.\n5. Go to 3D Settings > Mange 3D Settings.\n6. Change \\[Power management mode\\] to \\[Prefer maximum performance\\]. Make sure you are in Global Settings and not Program Settings.\n7. Restart.",

    "selftext": "Whenever I boot my PC it usually boots on a black screen not letting me do anything, I have to turn it off and on at the wall until it eventually decides to work which has taken anywhere from the second try to 4 hours of my life. Occasionally when I turn it on it goes to autorepair although when this issue started it said start up windows 11 when it should've said windows 10. It often crashes mid startup or randomly, I think its when the PC is doing something graphically intensive but im not fully sure on it because sometimes its random, mostly happened during intensive games or when im watching or doing discord streams. Additionally sometimes the screen also flickers before turning off. I've tried pretty much everything including a factory reset which stopped it for a few days but it came back fast so I think its a coincidence, currently my pc is not starting up at all and its just showing me the black screen with no signal. I have no clue what to do at all, im pretty sure its a gpu issue but ive got no clue how to fix that other than a repair shop which I really can't afford rn",

    "selftext": "So for context I have been building my own PCs as well as PCs for my friends, family and co-workers for a few years. I have built around 20 machines and never ever encountered an issue like this before. Maybe its common and I just don't know it, but for a few hours I felt like a crazy person. \n\nTo the best of my knowledge it started with a random shutdown and a boot to BIOS. My PC was on and I was making lunch, when I walked away I was on the desktop, when I came back 20mins later I was looking at the BIOS screen. I thought \"hmmm that's odd, the machine must have crashed, but why did it boot to the BIOS?\" I exited the bios and booted to regular boot drive. The windows spinning dots appeared and that just confirmed my suspicion that it was probably a crash. Whenever I have crashed in the past, the next boot the spinning dots always appear as windows check itself. \n\nI use my PC with no issues for the rest of the day, web browsing, gaming, a zoom meeting, everything is normal. Then I go to shut down and NOTHING HAPPENS. I click shut down, nothing happens. I click restart, nothing happens. I open a web browser and it opens normally. I boot a game and it loads normally. So I hit Ctrl + Alt + Delete and shut down from the blue windows screen. The windows spinning dots appear and it says shutting down. And then nothing. It stays stuck in a shutdown loop for like 30mins. Finally I get frustrated and hold down the power button. Next boot is painfully slow. Spinning windows dots for 15mins finally windows log in screen appears and I sign in. It takes 2 mins for the icons on my desktop to load. I think maybe my hard drive is crashing out so I run crystal disk and NOTHING HAPPENS. I double click it and the application just doesn't launch. Then as I'm sitting there in disbelief, a full 5 mins later the application opens and then immediately crashes. Games and web browser again launch totally normally. Now I'm looking through task manager desperately trying to figure out what's going on and I suddenly see something abnormal. my E: drive (Samsung 970 EVO 2TB) is showing 100% usage all the time. I open file explorer and try to look at the folders in the E: drive and it immediately freezes file explorer. I hold down the power button, unplug the E: drive SSD and then reboot. Perfect boot. I run crystal disk, it opens right away. I shut down. It shuts down instantly. \n\nWHAT THE HELL!!!!! Did my SSD just die suddenly without warning? I had to go to bed because I was exhausted after a night of troubleshooting this, but today im going to plug it back in and see what happens. I have never had an SSD go bad EVER let alone one that was just being used for storage and not as a boot drive. Is this common?\n\n",

    "selftext": "I have 2 monitors connected to my gaming PC, and my main monitors image is split down the middle where the second half is then also showing on the first half. I have tried 20-30 different \"fixes\" with the help of ChatGPT and nothing so far has worked permanently. It comes back every now and then when I turn my PC on for the day and I have no idea what fixes it. Sometimes unplugging the monitor does it, sometimes it doesn't. Restarting the PC sometimes works, sometimes it doesn't. I did observe something that could indicate that it is in fact a problem with the display itself but I am not sure as I am no expert. I powered on the monitor with my PC not running and even in standby mode with no graphics signal from the PC it still had the split/mirror issue. My second monitor through all of this has never had this happen and still doesn't even when the issue occurs on my main monitor. All of my drivers are up to date and windows is also up to date. Does anyone know about this or knows something that could help? ",

    "selftext": "So I have a new SSD, bought just a few months back.  \n  \nIt was working fine, although I felt it was a bit slow to login. For context, this SSD was from a clone of my previous smaller SSD that was filling up. Recently I was transferring a few files from another USB drive into this new SSD when the laptop I was using (an old Latitude 3500 at work) froze and then showed a BSOD. I noticed this freeze right as I plugged in the charger as I believe the battery was low, but I can't say if it was frozen before I plugged it in or if it happened after.  \n  \nWhen I tried to boot, I would either get an hard-drive not found error or there will be a forever looping disk check. If I skip that disk check, I get into the drive but then after a few minutes the laptop crashes to a BSOD, with either a MEMORY\\_MANAGEMENT error or something related to the disk.\n\nMy theory is that there was some corruption when a file was interrupted mid-sync to OneDrive during the initial freeze + crash. The last folder that was being copied at the moment of the incident has an invalid reparse point and I can't delete it as a result (this is NTFS) when I connect the drive to another system.\n\nI can view my files and folders if I put it in an SSD enclosure and connect to another device running Windows (not Linux because the drive is still encrypted even though Bitlocker is off). I can copy some files off but frequently, it would get stuck when it comes across like a shortcut or similar deep inside one of the folders.\n\nMy question is how best can I recover the contents of this drive before re-formatting it? To exFAT preferably. I have licensed Microsoft software including Visual Studio and other software purchased by my employer. Can I get all this back? Will just copying the contents of the registry directory be enough for those software specifically?",

But the problem is that the cooler plate doesn’t actually touch the CPU, even when the screws are fully tightened all the way down.\n\nBecause of that, the CPU overheats almost instantly. I double-checked the backplate, standoffs, and mounting brackets — everything seems installed correctly, but there’s still a visible gap between the cooler block and the CPU surface.\n\nHas anyone seen this issue before with this cooler or motherboard combo? Could it be a mounting bracket mismatch (AM5 vs LGA kit)? Any ideas on how to fix it?",

So i shut all my programs and set the brightness aa low as possible  and that seemed to help but in the last few days its gotten significantly worse, i will have my phone only charges the lowest brightness possible and will only be running one app at a time, and my battery gets chewed through. \n\nAnd last night i left it to charge for a few hours, i had it on airplane mode with no tabs open on the lowest brightness. So nothing was running at all, and i woke up to it with 10% less charge than it had before, its getting insufferable because i cant figure out whats making it eat so much battery. \n\nI assumed possibly that my battery needed replacing or it was an issue with my charger- but for some reason my phone charges A-okay between the hours of 7am-10am. I had it plugged in this morning and was running upwards of 4 apps on it and it charged up yo 100% just fine, but now ive plugged it back in again to charge up and its lost 10% whilst charging and literally just typing this post.\n\nDies anyone know why it only takes the charger at an arbitrary time in the morning? This is really annoying and inconvenient and i wont always have the time to do this if I have morning shifts. \n\nEDIT- a comment pointed out that I missed some key details so:\n\nI’m on an Iphone 12 that I got in 2023, its running IOS 17 I believe and it has not had any issues before this. I use a generic Amazon charger, and it dies have a tab saying my battery health has decreased but the only solution it gives me is buying a new battery and I wanna see if theres anything else I can do first.

It’s my first OLED monitor and so to make sure I don’t have burn in issues I set Windows to put the monitors to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. Note: I did not set the whole PC to go to sleep, only the monitors.\n\nBut I’m having an issue. The monitors seem to take longer than the specified amount of time to go to sleep. For example I just timed it and from the moment I stopped using the mouse and keyboard it took 22 minutes for the monitors to go to sleep rather than the set 15 minutes. It seems to always take a random amount of extra time for the monitors to go to sleep.\n\nHowever when I set Windows to put the monitors to sleep after just 1 minute for testing purposes it usually works fine. But as soon as I set it back to like 10 or 15 minutes it takes longer again.\n\nI did do some googling and ran the command “powercfg /requests” in an admin terminal and this was the output https://imgur.com/a/9oUCHWE\n\nI’m not sure if one of those things under the System section or Discord may be causing it to not work properly? But I would’ve thought if one of those were the issue then the monitors would never go to sleep rather than the issue I’m having.\n\nThe other thing I’ve done is disable Nvidia High Defintion Audio in device manager cause that was completely preventing the monitors from going to sleep.\n\nHoping someone can help me figure this out! TIA\n\n",

    "selftext": "I commented about this in the iphone battery thread as well but thought itd be worth checking multiple places just to be sure. \n\nSo over the last week my phones been losing battery whilst actively on charge,  at first i thought it was because i was running too many programs. So i shut all my programs and set the brightness aa low as possible  and that seemed to help but in the last few days its gotten significantly worse, i will have my phone only charges the lowest brightness possible and will only be running one app at a time, and my battery gets chewed through. \n\nAnd last night i left it to charge for a few hours, i had it on airplane mode with no tabs open on the lowest brightness. So nothing was running at all, and i woke up to it with 10% less charge than it had before, its getting insufferable because i cant figure out whats making it eat so much battery. \n\nI assumed possibly that my battery needed replacing or it was an issue with my charger- but for some reason my phone charges A-okay between the hours of 7am-10am. I had it plugged in this morning and was running upwards of 4 apps on it and it charged up yo 100% just fine, but now ive plugged it back in again to charge up and its lost 10% whilst charging and literally just typing this post.\n\nDies anyone know why it only takes the charger at an arbitrary time in the morning? This is really annoying and inconvenient and i wont always have the time to do this if I have morning shifts. \n\nEDIT- a comment pointed out that I missed some key details so:\n\nI’m on an Iphone 12 that I got in 2023, its running IOS 17 I believe and it has not had any issues before this. I use a generic Amazon charger, and it dies have a tab saying my battery health has decreased but the only solution it gives me is buying a new battery and I wanna see if theres anything else I can do first.

    "selftext": "So I have a new SSD, bought just a few months back.  \n  \nIt was working fine, although I felt it was a bit slow to login. For context, this SSD was from a clone of my previous smaller SSD that was filling up. Recently I was transferring a few files from another USB drive into this new SSD when the laptop I was using (an old Latitude 3500 at work) froze and then showed a BSOD. I noticed this freeze right as I plugged in the charger as I believe the battery was low, but I can't say if it was frozen before I plugged it in or if it happened after.  \n  \nWhen I tried to boot, I would either get an hard-drive not found error or there will be a forever looping disk check. If I skip that disk check, I get into the drive but then after a few minutes the laptop crashes to a BSOD, with either a MEMORY\\_MANAGEMENT error or something related to the disk.\n\nMy theory is that there was some corruption when a file was interrupted mid-sync to OneDrive during the initial freeze + crash. The last folder that was being copied at the moment of the incident has an invalid reparse point and I can't delete it as a result (this is NTFS) when I connect the drive to another system.\n\nI can view my files and folders if I put it in an SSD enclosure and connect to another device running Windows (not Linux because the drive is still encrypted even though Bitlocker is off). I can copy some files off but frequently, it would get stuck when it comes across like a shortcut or similar deep inside one of the folders.\n\nMy question is how best can I recover the contents of this drive before re-formatting it? To exFAT preferably. I have licensed Microsoft software including Visual Studio and other software purchased by my employer. Can I get all this back? Will just copying the contents of the registry directory be enough for those software specifically?",

The PC recognises the monitor in settings but always says no signal on the monitor, unless I change the monitors resolution in NVIDIA control panel to 1080i rather than 1080p, in which cases I get a blurry and jittery image which blacks out periodically.

(The alarm sound I chose is from the standard set that comes with the phone.)\n\nIf I select a song as the alarm sound, my music library (same library as the one used by Apple Music) opens so I can choose a song. When the alarm goes off, it also does *not* play through the speaker, although it does play on the phone. \n\nThe weak link seems to be the clock app. I looked for the clock app in the settings app to see if there’s a setting for playing on a remote speaker, but I did not find it. \n\nCan anyone tell me how to fix this? I’m hard of hearing, and my phone is simply not loud enough to wake me up, even if I use the loudest song or sound as the alarm. That’s one reason I bought the speaker, so i can wake up reliably. \n\nThank you!",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI recently bought a QD-OLED monitor to use as my main monitor with 2 regular monitors on the sides of it. It’s my first OLED monitor and so to make sure I don’t have burn in issues I set Windows to put the monitors to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. Note: I did not set the whole PC to go to sleep, only the monitors.\n\nBut I’m having an issue. The monitors seem to take longer than the specified amount of time to go to sleep. For example I just timed it and from the moment I stopped using the mouse and keyboard it took 22 minutes for the monitors to go to sleep rather than the set 15 minutes. It seems to always take a random amount of extra time for the monitors to go to sleep.\n\nHowever when I set Windows to put the monitors to sleep after just 1 minute for testing purposes it usually works fine. But as soon as I set it back to like 10 or 15 minutes it takes longer again.\n\nI did do some googling and ran the command “powercfg /requests” in an admin terminal and this was the output https://imgur.com/a/9oUCHWE\n\nI’m not sure if one of those things under the System section or Discord may be causing it to not work properly? But I would’ve thought if one of those were the issue then the monitors would never go to sleep rather than the issue I’m having.\n\nThe other thing I’ve done is disable Nvidia High Defintion Audio in device manager cause that was completely preventing the monitors from going to sleep.\n\nHoping someone can help me figure this out!

So i shut all my programs and set the brightness aa low as possible  and that seemed to help but in the last few days its gotten significantly worse, i will have my phone only charges the lowest brightness possible and will only be running one app at a time, and my battery gets chewed through. \n\nAnd last night i left it to charge for a few hours, i had it on airplane mode with no tabs open on the lowest brightness. So nothing was running at all, and i woke up to it with 10% less charge than it had before, its getting insufferable because i cant figure out whats making it eat so much battery. \n\nI assumed possibly that my battery needed replacing or it was an issue with my charger- but for some reason my phone charges A-okay between the hours of 7am-10am. I had it plugged in this morning and was running upwards of 4 apps on it and it charged up yo 100% just fine, but now ive plugged it back in again to charge up and its lost 10% whilst charging and literally just typing this post.\n\nDies anyone know why it only takes the charger at an arbitrary time in the morning? This is really annoying and inconvenient and i wont always have the time to do this if I have morning shifts. \n\nEDIT- a comment pointed out that I missed some key details so:\n\nI’m on an Iphone 12 that I got in 2023, its running IOS 17 I believe and it has not had any issues before this. I use a generic Amazon charger, and it dies have a tab saying my battery health has decreased but the only solution it gives me is buying a new battery and I wanna see if theres anything else I can do first.

    "selftext": "So I have a new SSD, bought just a few months back.  \n  \nIt was working fine, although I felt it was a bit slow to login. For context, this SSD was from a clone of my previous smaller SSD that was filling up. Recently I was transferring a few files from another USB drive into this new SSD when the laptop I was using (an old Latitude 3500 at work) froze and then showed a BSOD. I noticed this freeze right as I plugged in the charger as I believe the battery was low, but I can't say if it was frozen before I plugged it in or if it happened after.  \n  \nWhen I tried to boot, I would either get an hard-drive not found error or there will be a forever looping disk check. If I skip that disk check, I get into the drive but then after a few minutes the laptop crashes to a BSOD, with either a MEMORY\\_MANAGEMENT error or something related to the disk.\n\nMy theory is that there was some corruption when a file was interrupted mid-sync to OneDrive during the initial freeze + crash. The last folder that was being copied at the moment of the incident has an invalid reparse point and I can't delete it as a result (this is NTFS) when I connect the drive to another system.\n\nI can view my files and folders if I put it in an SSD enclosure and connect to another device running Windows (not Linux because the drive is still encrypted even though Bitlocker is off). I can copy some files off but frequently, it would get stuck when it comes across like a shortcut or similar deep inside one of the folders.\n\nMy question is how best can I recover the contents of this drive before re-formatting it? To exFAT preferably. I have licensed Microsoft software including Visual Studio and other software purchased by my employer. Can I get all this back? Will just copying the contents of the registry directory be enough for those software specifically?",

    "title": "3rd monitor does not work with display port to hdmi on gtx 1050",
    "selftext": "# I have a GTX 1050 and just got a 3rd monitor which means I am forced to use the DisplayPort slot. The monitor is hdmi only and I have tried two different DisplayPort TO HDMI connectors (I have double and triple checked they are both the right way round, one was an adaptor that plugged into a HDMI cable into the monitor and the other was a direct DP to HDMI cable). The PC recognises the monitor in settings but always says no signal on the monitor, unless I change the monitors resolution in NVIDIA control panel to 1080i rather than 1080p, in which cases I get a blurry and jittery image which blacks out periodically. Anyone know what the issue is likely to be? I suspect I need a better cable but wanted to check before I paid more for one.\n\nSo far I have tried:  \n\\- unplugging pc and or monitor for 1+ minutes and then reconnecting  \n\\- windows + ctrl + shift + b to reset graphics  \n\\- messing with windows P  \n\\- plugging the monitor straight into my hdmi port: works but the monitor already in hdmi doesn't work plugged into the DP",

    "selftext": "I have two identical widescreen LG monitors set at 3440 x 1440, 60hz refresh. Both monitors are connected to a HP display dock via DP 1.4 cables. Everything had been working fine for \\~3 years until this morning where for some reasons, I noticed that everything was kinda laggy on one monitor and it turned out that its refresh rate is capped at 30hz. I went into the display settings for that monitor and there is no option to go above 30hz. If I unplug the monitor with 60hz, the other monitor gets to 60hz immediately. \n\nOn paper it seems like a bandwidth issue BUT both monitors were working fine at 60hz before. The issue is only present since this morning. Does anyone know what's going on?\n\nThings that I've tried (but didn't work):\n\n* Reset the computer multiple times\n* Unplug and replug everything\n* Checked monitor settings to make sure that both are set to DisplayPort Version 1.4\n\n",
