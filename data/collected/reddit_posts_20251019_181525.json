Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

Apple claims that this system is private and secure, but the code is proprietary, and such claims have to be taken on faith. It is well known that even with perfect cryptographic guarantees, logical flaws might creep into protocols, and allow undesirable attacks.\n\nThis paper presents a symbolic model of the Find My protocol, as well as a precise formal specification of desirable properties.",

    "selftext": "> For those unaware, Apple claims that the iPhone 16 and 17 series support 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), but in practice this is **highly limited** compared with the full standard.  \n>  \n> **Wi-Fi 7’s most important technical features include:**  \n>  \n> • **Up to 240 MHz channel width on the 5 GHz band**  \n> • **Up to 320 MHz channel width on the 6 GHz band**  \n> • **4096-QAM modulation**  \n> • **MLMR MLO (Multi-Link Multi-Radio)** capable of aggregating multiple Wi-Fi bands into one high-throughput pipeline  \n>  \n> While Apple meets the *minimum certification requirement* (MLSR MLO), it disables nearly all optional features that make Wi-Fi 7 truly high-performance. As a result, **iPhone 16 and 17 models perform at speeds comparable to Wi-Fi 6/6E**, while other flagship phones achieve **3–4× higher throughput** using the optional features Apple ignored for two generations.  \n>  \n> For context, Wi-Fi 6/6E tops out at **160 MHz-wide channels**, **1024-QAM modulation**, and only one Wi-Fi band at a time — yielding peak theoretical speeds around **2402 Mbps**.  \n>  \n> Wi-Fi 7, when fully implemented, doubles channel width to 320 MHz, quadruples QAM density to 4096, and enables **true multi-band operation via MLO**, dramatically increasing real-world throughput.  \n>  \n> Apple’s iPhones, however, still restrict channels to 160 MHz, leave QAM at 1024, and only use MLO as a basic failover mechanism — effectively **Wi-Fi 6/6E with rudimentary band steering**.  \n>  \n> Some argue that wider channels, higher QAM, or MLMR MLO would drain battery. While Apple may have designed these limits intentionally, other flagship phones fully enable these features **without widespread battery complaints**, showing it’s a feasible design choice.  \n>  \n> Others claim that 5 GHz doesn’t support 240 MHz channels — but in regions like the **United States**, access points can operate at 240 MHz on 5 GHz, and Apple’s iPhones simply don’t take advantage of it.  \n>  \n> Apple’s documentation confirms that the Broadcom chip in the iPhone 16 series and the N1 chip in the iPhone 17 series are **capped to a single 160 MHz band**. Meanwhile, users have observed the performance discrepancy across multiple forums and reviews:  \n>  \n> • [Jason Deegan review](https://jasondeegan.com/iphone-16-review-disappointment-with-wifi-7-performance/)  \n> • [Apple forum complaints](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255812908?sortBy=rank)  \n> • [MacRumors forum complaints](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-buy-wifi7-router.2438418/)  \n> • [Apple's official tech specs of 16 & 17 series](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/wi-fi-ethernet-specifications-apple-devices-dep268652e6c/web)  \n> • [TP-Link Community complaints](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/705570)  \n> • [YouTube comparison of the 16 series](https://youtu.be/07FRuS67iD8)  \n> • [YouTube comparison of the 17 series](https://youtu.be/VtimPHdiv7U)  \n> • [YouTube warning not to buy Wi-Fi 7 routers](https://youtube.com/shorts/Pc3dAEoPPFo)  \n> • [MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/apple-n1-chip-has-wi-fi-7-limitation/)  \n> • [5GStore analysis](https://5gstore.com/blog/2025/09/16/apple-n1-chip-wifi-7-iphone-17/#what-wccftech-found-apples-n-1-chip-its-limitation)  \n> • [PhoneArena article](https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-16-pro-models-prevented-from-reaching-full-wi-fi-7-potential_id163151)  \n> • [iThinkDiff article](https://www.ithinkdiff.com/apple-n1-chip-iphone-17-wifi-7-limit/)  \n> • [iPhoneWired article](https://iphonewired.com/news/857921/)  \n>  \n> In conclusion, many users invest in premium iPhones and Wi-Fi 7 equipment expecting the full benefits of the standard. Apple’s current implementation delivers **minimal improvement over Wi-Fi 6/6E**.  \n>  \n> **If you’d like to see full Wi-Fi 7 features enabled on Apple devices, submit feedback via Safari:**  \n\n1.

    "title": "The iPhone Upgrade Program is absolutely NOT compatible with AppleCare One",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR: DO NOT try and add your iPhone Upgrade Program iPhone to AppleCare One, unless you want significant problems down the road.**\n\nI added my 16 Pro to AppleCare One in July, a few days after the program started. The support specialist read me boilerplate along the lines of \"In order to remain enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program, you must immediately add your phone to AppleCare One to ensure no gap in coverage\". I did that, got a gift card back for \\~$120, and felt happy with myself.\n\nI successfully used the program to get a 17 Pro a few weeks ago, which I picked up in store. However, when I came to return the 16 Pro, the phone was marked as \"Enrolled in iPhone Upgrade Program\", but the option to close the loan was greyed out with \"loan details not found\". The store associates, up to and including supervisors were very confused by this and hadn't seen it before.\n\nAfter approximately **11 hours** on the phone with Citizens, and Apple Support, speaking with about 15 different people, all of whom were very friendly, but none of whom had any idea what had happened, and **3 visits** to the store, I was eventually advised to return the phone as a standalone trade-in, and receive a store gift card. I then had to call a special escalated support number and have them cancel the gift card and close the loan. (It still ended with a 4¢ balance, which I then had to pay Citizens by credit card 😅)\n\nI eventually had final confirmation from that escalated support line that, despite what AppleCare specialists tell you, and despite the boilerplate coverage language, cancelling the Theft and Loss protection to put your phone into AppleCare One **immediately** cancels the Upgrade Program eligibility. Obviously some systems are aware of this (allowing me to upgrade to 17 Pro), and some are not (preventing me from returning 16 Pro).\n\nI asked about the 17 Pro and confirmed that it too had been removed from the program. They advised me to do a Closed Box return in store and then immediately re-buy the same phone through the program to get it back into eligibility. I tried this, and while I passed the credit check and managed to keep my same phone, Verizon refused to activate the line (presumably because it was already connected - to me). As a result, I couldn't complete the transaction, and ended up having to re-buy my phone outright.\n\nTo Apple's credit, they recognized what a clusterfuck this was, and gave me a credit of $250, which I used for some AirPods Pro 3, and the guy in-store also gave me an Ultra Watch band for free. I also ended up with a negative loan balance of $260, which I got back as a check, and when you add back the $120 gift card back from July, I ended up doing ok. \n\nBut, it was an incredible time and energy suck and I did have to drop $1400 all in one go. I am lucky that I could just do that otherwise I would have left the store without my phone and then who knows what would have happened. I do not recommend this adventure to anyone. \n\nHopefully by the time the next phones are released there will be a proper integrated upgrade path, but for now, if you want to preserve your sanity, just stick with Theft and Loss coverage.\n\n ",

    "title": "Hazel is overkill for 90% of users. Mine works in 3 clicks.",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple! 👋\n\nI'm excited to share Neatify, a macOS productivity app I've been working on for automatic file organization.\n\n# \"Wait, isn't this just Hazel?\"\n\nFair question. I know Hazel exists, and it's an incredibly powerful tool. But here's the thing: Hazel is built for people who love to customize every detail. **Neatify is built for people who want their files organized instantly, without setup or scripting.**\n\n**I made Neatify for people who:**\n\n* Value automation that works right away\n* Want images in one folder, PDFs in another, done\n* Prefer project-based file routing without extra configuration\n* Want clarity instead of complexity\n\nThink of it this way: Hazel is a custom-built PC. Neatify is a MacBook that just works.\n\nBoth are powerful, but one lets you skip the setup and get things done faster.\n\nIf you enjoy building complex automation workflows, Hazel is fantastic. If you just want your files to go where they belong while you focus on your work, Neatify is built for you.\n\n# The Problem I'm Solving\n\nYou're working on multiple projects simultaneously. Literature essay, art history presentation, geopolitics research paper. Files are everywhere. Downloads folder is chaos. Every time you save or download something, you face decision fatigue: \"Where should this go?\"\n\nYou could use Hazel, but after 30 minutes of documentation and rule setup, you're more overwhelmed than when you started.\n\n# How Neatify Works\n\n**🎯 Project-Based Organization**\n\nCreate a project structure in 3 clicks:\n\n1. Name your project (e.g., \"Literature Essay\")\n2. Select file types to manage (Images, PDFs, Presentations)\n3. Choose location (Desktop, Documents, wherever)\n\nDone. Now every image you download automatically goes to Literature Essay/Images. Every PDF to Literature Essay/PDFs. No manual sorting.\n\n**⚡️ Smart File Sorting with Saved Rules**\n\nCreate reusable sorting configurations. One for work, one for personal files, one for creative projects. Switch between them from the menu bar in one click.\n\n**🔄 Quick Sorter**\n\nNeed to organize something right now? Quick Sorter lets you point at a folder, pick file types, and start sorting immediately. Perfect for one-off tasks.\n\n**🧹 Bulk File Organizer**\n\nGot a messy folder with 500 mixed files? Select it, and Neatify reorganizes everything into a clean structure (Visual/Images, Visual/Videos, Audio, Code/Frontend, Code/Backend, Documents, etc.) in seconds.\n\n**🚀 Set It and Forget It**\n\nEnable \"Launch at Login\" with a default project or rule. Neatify runs silently in your menu bar. Your files stay organized without you thinking about it.\n\n**📊 Menu Bar Control**\n\nClose the app, it lives in your menu bar. Switch sorting rules, pause/resume, or check status without opening the main window.\n\n# Why I Built This\n\nI was constantly switching between projects and drowning in file chaos. I tried Hazel, spent hours configuring it, felt more stressed, and thought: \"There has to be a simpler way.\"\n\nSo I built Neatify to do one thing really well: keep your files organized so you can focus on your work, not your folders.\n\nIt's 100% native macOS (Swift + SwiftUI), optimized for performance, and follows Apple's design language. No Electron bloat.\n\n# Try the Beta\n\nNeatify is currently in public beta on TestFlight. I'd genuinely love your feedback, especially from anyone who's tried Hazel and found it too heavy, or anyone juggling multiple projects who's tired of file chaos.\n\nBeta Access: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/Eyp3uwZS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Eyp3uwZS)  \nWebsite: [https://neatifyhq.com](https://neatifyhq.com)  \nDemo: [https://neatifyhq.com/#demo](https://neatifyhq.com/#demo)\n\nI'd Love Your Thoughts On\n\n* Does the \"simpler alternative to Hazel\" positioning make sense?\n* What file organization pain points do you face daily?\n* For Hazel users: what would make you consider a faster, easier tool?\n* Any concerns about automatic file management?\n\nI'll be here all day answering questions, discussing workflows, or debating the merits of different organization philosophies. Thanks for reading! 🙏",

As someone who uses 3 screens (two external and a mac), this solves a real issue for me because I like to assign each screen a purpose (communications, development, design) to make my workflow clearer.\n\n[ExtraDock](https://extradock.app/?ref=rapple) doesn't require any permission to work, it is fully customizable (colors, size, auto-hide, show on hover and more), and works offline.\n\nThere's a full demo and feature list on the [website](https://extradock.app/?ref=rapple), so feel free to check it out! Feedback very appreciated!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAbout two months ago I released a major update to my weather app [Sonuby Weather](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1560347507?pt=122856099&ct=r_apple_october_2025&mt=8), which some of you might remember from my [Promo Sunday post last December](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1hjwv12/i_built_a_fully_customizable_forecast_app_for/).\n\nThe latest update features the first truly configurable weather widgets for iOS, letting you build your personal forecast dashboard right on your home screen.\n\n**Here's what makes them special:**\n\n* **3 widget types** \\- Now & Next Hours (up to 42h on iPad), Next Days (up to 12 days), and Now & Next Hours Extended for twice the variables\n* **9 specialized reports** \\- Choose between Daily Life, Health, Snow Sports, Surfing, Photography, Hiking, and more - each showing relevant variables for that activity\n* **Truly customizable** \\- Don't like the default layout? Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

Apple claims that this system is private and secure, but the code is proprietary, and such claims have to be taken on faith. It is well known that even with perfect cryptographic guarantees, logical flaws might creep into protocols, and allow undesirable attacks.\n\nThis paper presents a symbolic model of the Find My protocol, as well as a precise formal specification of desirable properties.",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

No problem. With Press Mode, you can open Dory’s sleek UI using a global shortcut or a **trackpad gesture!** (new)\n\nDory works right out of the box - and over time, it learns which apps you use most and prioritizes them.\n\nNo extra shortcuts.\n\nNo setup. Nothing to remember.\n\n\\--\n\nIt's currently $4.99 on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dory-app-switcher/id6746273626?mt=12) (**One-time purchase**. **No subscription.**) for a limited time.",

For the premium prices we pay for these cases ($57 after tax) it's insane that this garbage company wants to make zero actual amends for paying customers while continuing to make excuses. Several people have tried canceling their order and the customer service team doesn't even have the decency to get back to them in a timely fashion.\n\nOh and the cases that are shipping apparently have rattling buttons, which will apparently be replaced based on the degree they bother the end user.\n\nNever, ever again.",

It was essentially a complete strangers phone yet somehow with simple YouTube videos I unlocked it and it appears that the data wasn’t deleted it stills has pictures, apps, Snapchat was logged in, wallpaper was the same… however now a friend wants me to unlock their old iPhone 4 without the password to get pictures and whatever other nostalgia it contains but when I look it up it says this is impossible which obviously is so people can’t steal a phone and get peoples data. But How did I do it the first time? Why was I able to get at least some maybe all of the data kept on the iPhone?\n",

So I have created a shortcut where I only have to click one button and it’s all done for me.\n\nTo create a share sheet shortcut to message yourself, open the Shortcuts app, tap the plus sign, and add a \"Send Message\" action. In the recipient field, select yourself, and in the message field, choose \"Shortcut Input\". Finally, tap the details and enable \"Show in Share Sheet\" so you can access it from any app.\n\nStep 1: Create the shortcut Open the Shortcuts app.\nTap the + button to create a new shortcut. Tap Add Action. Search for and select the Send Message action. In the \"Send Message\" action, tap the Recipients field and select your own contact. In the Message field, tap the input bar at the top and choose Shortcut Input.\n\nStep 2: Enable share sheet Tap the details icon (a circle with an 'i' inside) at the top right of the shortcut editor. Toggle on the Show in Share Sheet option. Tap Done.\n\nStep 3: Use the shortcut Name the shortcut something like \"Message Myself\" and choose an icon. Tap the Share button (a square with an arrow pointing up) in any app. Find and tap your new shortcut from the list to send the current content to yourself in a new message.\n",

I just found out they don’t allow videos here, so I will attach photos. In photos the bar is at different level but its brightening the screen at same level, if I go lower than that it will further dim the screen but doesn’t make any difference if I go all the way up.\nAny advice is appreciated.",

Gave me a loaner that doesnt really work because it couldn't be activated. How long do they usually take to repair ? I have apple care but this just feels very inconvenient maybe upgrading every year is the way to go so they have your models in stock",

I know it has a raised lip for the plateau but i don't want the plateau exposed at all. The dbrand covers the back completely which is ideal, but it has no kickstand. A case that is sort of a happy medium between these two is the casekoo, but this case still leaves some parts exposed, not a perfect cutout like the dbrand. Can anyone offer a recommendation? Preferably a clear case.",

However, the phone still seems to function — I can hear notifications, access Siri, and even toggle the flashlight from the lock screen, which makes me think the touchscreen is still responsive.\n\nI’ve read several posts mentioning similar issues after updating to the latest iOS version, which makes me wonder if this could be a widespread manufacturing or software defect.\n\nUnfortunately, my warranty coverage has already expired, and I’m a broke college student that has no way to get it repaired at full price lol.\n\nHas anyone here successfully had this issue repaired or replaced by Apple free of charge despite being out of warranty? If so, how?\n\nAny advice or experience would be greatly appreciated. I just want to know if Apple acknowledges this as a known issue and if there’s any way I might still be eligible for a free repair or replacement.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I would like to know if I can use my phone as usual, use it long enough, play games, write messages, use it for my alarm clocks...

WHY Apple?!? Has anyone else suffered from this glitch, and does anyone have any advice on how to avoid it?

    "selftext": "Hey guys,\nI’m planning to buy the iPhone 17 Pro but honestly, I’ve been seeing a lot of posts and videos talking about the aluminium body scratching way too easily (“scratch-gate” as some people call it).\n\nI’m thinking of going with the silver one since it supposedly hides scratches better, and I’ll mostly be using it with a case. But at the same time, if I’m spending this much money on a phone, I feel like I should have the freedom to use it without a cover and not worry every second about scuffs or marks.\n\nThe regular iPhone 17 covers all my needs tbh — I don’t really care about the camera upgrades, but I like the bigger battery, vapour chamber cooling, and just the overall premium feel of the Pro. The basic one felt kinda bland in hand.\n\nSo my question is — is this scratch issue actually that serious? Are people exaggerating, or is the aluminium really that fragile? I plan to use the phone for at least 3–4 years, so I don’t want something that starts looking beat up after a few months.\n\nShould I just go ahead and buy it, or wait for the 18 if Apple fixes this issue next year?\nWould love to hear real user experiences from anyone already using it.\n\n",

Is there any simple way to transfer photos between Android and iPhone without downloading new apps or using cloud services?\n\nAnd can I use the ios foto share on windows ?\n",

    "selftext": "\nI own an iPhone 15. Bought it around November of 2023 (or 2024 I’m not entirely sure) \n\nIt’s a great phone. Works well. Battery is good enough (for an IPhone at least😂) but I have a problem. My pictures come out very foggy. \n\nAt first I thought it was because the camera is dirty. I tend to eat and use my phone at the same time so I thought maybe some residue was on it and thoroughly cleaned it. Still, pictures came out blurry. \n\nThen I thought okay, maybe the quality seems different because I have Night shift and True Tone on all day (idk I just prefer the orange tint night tone gives, without it the screen is too bright. But that’s a me problem, not related to this) and I tried switching them off and took some pics. Still foggy. Not blurred. Just foggy.\n\nThe photo attached is what I just took, just to show how foggy and just….idk dull it looks. The picture looks very lifeless and gray. Whereas my friend who has an iPhone 16, her pictures come out sunny and bright and vibrant.\n\nIs this a problem with all iPhone 15 phones or just mine? Or am I just that bad at clicking pictures lmao?😭\n",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

When they set up & activated their iPhones, not only does it show that he indeed has AppleCare+ attached to the iPhone, but that the policy until 2034, nine years from now, which is insane as AppleCare+ is only for 2 years and then you can extend it afterwards up to a total of 5 years on a per month basis. We went back to the Genius Bar and had them check the serial number on Mobile Genius, and it is indeed genuine and an actual policy #. Totally covered. So now I’m actually wondering what happens in 9 years when the iPhone Air is officially considered “vintage” or “obsolete”, how do they even go about repairs or replacement if anything were to happen to it? I’ve never seen this before. ",

So I have created a shortcut where I only have to click one button and it’s all done for me.\n\nTo create a share sheet shortcut to message yourself, open the Shortcuts app, tap the plus sign, and add a \"Send Message\" action. In the recipient field, select yourself, and in the message field, choose \"Shortcut Input\". Finally, tap the details and enable \"Show in Share Sheet\" so you can access it from any app.\n\nStep 1: Create the shortcut Open the Shortcuts app.\nTap the + button to create a new shortcut. Tap Add Action. Search for and select the Send Message action. In the \"Send Message\" action, tap the Recipients field and select your own contact. In the Message field, tap the input bar at the top and choose Shortcut Input.\n\nStep 2: Enable share sheet Tap the details icon (a circle with an 'i' inside) at the top right of the shortcut editor. Toggle on the Show in Share Sheet option. Tap Done.\n\nStep 3: Use the shortcut Name the shortcut something like \"Message Myself\" and choose an icon. Tap the Share button (a square with an arrow pointing up) in any app. Find and tap your new shortcut from the list to send the current content to yourself in a new message.\n",

I just found out they don’t allow videos here, so I will attach photos. In photos the bar is at different level but its brightening the screen at same level, if I go lower than that it will further dim the screen but doesn’t make any difference if I go all the way up.\nAny advice is appreciated.",

However, the speaker for loudspeaker phone calls is pretty quiet, even at max volume to the point where it’s the only thing I’m not entirely sure I can deal with. I know it’s a small thing but I also have a base 17 ( I will be returning one of them in the next week ) and the speakers on that thing are fantastic. \n\nIs there some hidden setting I’m missing the can eek out a little more from the mono speaker? 😂",

When they set up & activated their iPhones, not only does it show that he indeed has AppleCare+ attached to the iPhone, but that the policy until 2034, nine years from now, which is insane as AppleCare+ is only for 2 years and then you can extend it afterwards up to a total of 5 years on a per month basis. We went back to the Genius Bar and had them check the serial number on Mobile Genius, and it is indeed genuine and an actual policy #. Totally covered. So now I’m actually wondering what happens in 9 years when the iPhone Air is officially considered “vintage” or “obsolete”, how do they even go about repairs or replacement if anything were to happen to it?

Several people have tried canceling their order and the customer service team doesn't even have the decency to get back to them in a timely fashion.\n\nOh and the cases that are shipping apparently have rattling buttons, which will apparently be replaced based on the degree they bother the end user.\n\nNever, ever again.",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Has *anyone in the general public* actually received their Titan 2 yet?\n2. If yes, how’s it holding up — build quality, battery, keyboard feel, software stability, camera, etc.?\n3. Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Samsung is canceling the upcoming s26 edge completly. but should it?\n\nCurrent reports say its because of poor sales of the 25 edge (only 178k in the first month) vs the other s series (s25 ultra with 1.5m, s25 with more than 1m). \n\nFor my opinion, the poor sales of the s25 edge were caused only because thats a new technology and it was mostly a prototype phone.\nIt had many problems and seemed rushed and unfinished (wasnt that thin, small battery, no telephoto camera). It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

The phone suddenly stopped working overnight while charging normally.\n\nI sent it for repair through the official Google channel and received a diagnosis of “liquid damage”, with a repair quote of € 644.52 (out of warranty).\n\nHowever, the phone was never exposed to water. I asked Google Support for objective technical evidence (report, photos, LCI readings, methodology, technician ID, etc.), but they said they don’t have any documentation or photos, since the device was returned immediately after I declined the quote.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2019/771 (transposed in Portugal as Decree-Law 84/2021), sellers must provide technical proof when excluding warranty due to alleged misuse — otherwise, the fault is presumed to have existed at delivery.\n\nThe case was escalated to a “second-line” team three days ago, but I haven’t received any update.\n\nHas anyone in the EU experienced a similar situation with Google repairs? Were you able to get photos, a technical report, or have the decision overturned?\n\nI just want a transparent and evidence-based assessment — nothing more, nothing less.",

    "title": "[Dev] Introducing Media Bar - Control media playback from your status bar with swipe gestures!",
    "selftext": "Hi all! I've been working on something I think you'll find useful. **Media Bar** transforms your Android status bar into a functional media controller and progress indicator.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nInstead of pulling down notifications or switching apps to control your music/podcast/video, you can now:\n\n* **See media progress** as a thin colored bar along your status bar\n* **Swipe left/right** on the status bar to scrub through your media\n* **Tap, double-tap, or long-press** three invisible regions on the status bar for custom actions (play/pause, skip, jump forward/back, launch app, etc.)\n\n**How is this different from Android's Live Notifications or OneUI's Now Bar?**\n\nWhile Android's live notifications and Samsung's Now Bar are excellent features, Media Bar takes a different approach:\n\n* **Always visible, minimal footprint** \\- Just a thin line on your status bar (can be as small as 1 pixel), not a pill or expandable widget that takes screen real estate\n* **Blind muscle memory control** \\- Your entire status bar becomes an interactive surface. No need to look for or tap specific small buttons\n* **Works system-wide** \\- Doesn't matter which media app you're using or which Android skin you have\n* **Swipe to scrub** \\- Directly scrub through your media by swiping, rather than tapping skip buttons\n* **Deep customization** \\- Color coding for progress tracking, custom button zones, transparency options, etc.\n\nThink of it as complementary to those features - it's for when you want the most minimal, muscle-memory-based control possible.\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nI found myself constantly interrupting my workflow to control media playback - whether I was gaming, browsing, or working. I wanted something that was always visible and accessible without being intrusive.\n\n**The \"aha\" moment:**\n\nHere's the thing - **Media Bar might feel a bit unusual at first, but give it a day or two.** Once your muscle memory kicks in, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.\n\nImagine this: You're at the gym mid-rep and need to pause your music. Instead of fumbling to find the play button, your thumb just *knows* where to tap on the status bar. Or you're deep into a 3-hour podcast and want to skip ahead - a quick swipe does it without even looking.\n\n**That's the magic**: your fingers learn the zones, and suddenly media control becomes second nature. No more hunting for tiny buttons or pulling focus from what you're doing. It just... flows. I'm confident that once it becomes part of your routine, it'll feel indispensable.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n**Color coding options** \\- Solid colors, dynamic (based on album art/app), segments (changes color at different progress points), or gradients\n\n**Highly customizable** \\- Adjust the bar's thickness (down to 1 pixel!), position (top/bottom), transparency, button regions, and more\n\n**Smart behavior** \\- Auto-hides in fullscreen apps, works with any media player\n\nIf you want to give it a shot, [get it from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.mediabar)! I would love to hear what you guys think about it and happy to answer any questions you may have! I would specifically like to hear if you build a muscle memory for it! :)",

The issue got escalated to an incident this morning.\n\nWell, I just got news that Google thinks the Pixel hanging/crashing apps bug is now fixed. I've asked for clarification on whether the fix is server-side or requires a Play Services update. https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1977868145840050230\n\n**Update**: Alright, got confirmation that the Pixel crashing/hanging apps fix is server-side. There will be a post-mortem within Google, but I'm not sure if it will be made public. Incidents like this one cannot happen again.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI’m a bit late to share this, but I recently built a small open-source project called **LocalScreenShare**.  \nIt lets you instantly share your phone screen with another phone or even mirror your PC’s screen **over local Wi-Fi or hotspot**, with **no internet, no ads, and no accounts**.\n\nI actually got the idea after seeing a bunch of Reddit threads where people were struggling with screen mirroring apps full of ads, setup pain, or random cloud logins.  \nSo I decided to make something simple, local, and private, just devices talking directly to each other.\n\nIt uses Android’s `MediaProjection` API to capture the display → compress frames → stream them over TCP sockets, all locally.  \nEverything stays on your own network and no servers, no tracking.\n\n🧩 **Features:**  \n📱 Phone-to-phone screen share  \n🖥️ PC-to-phone mirroring  \n🔐 Secure 6-digit PIN  \n🎚️ Adjustable FPS (10–60)  \n🧠 Hotspot-friendly  \n⚡ 100% ad-free, pure Kotlin\n\nI originally built it for fun after seeing how messy screen mirroring apps had become.  \nIt’s under **MIT License**, so if anyone wants to **contribute, improve, or extend** it .... please do! 🙏\n\n👉 [GitHub – LocalScreenShare](https://github.com/erTesla/LocalScreenShare-Android.git)\n\nThanks for reading 💙  \n– Anees",

    "title": "I Switched from iPhone to Android: My Story of Losses and Gains",
    "selftext": "# Hey Reddit! I want to share my story of switching from iPhone to Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It wasn't just choosing a new phone; it was a real journey full of expectations, doubts, and unexpected discoveries.\n\n# Introduction: Seeking a New Experience\n\nI used an iPhone 13 Pro and it was almost perfect. Even when the Pixel 10 came out, I had no desire to watch the presentation. But over time, I started to feel a \"technological itch.\" I was tired of Apple's predictability and the lack of true innovation. When the 17th iPhone came out again without significant AI improvements, it was the final disappointment. On the horizon appeared the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra — a symbol of freedom, customization, and powerful AI. This wasn't just a phone choice; it was a choice of a new philosophy. I dreamed of a world where I control my device, not the other way around.\n\n# Part I: Pros and Cons from My Experience\n\niPhone (iOS): The World I Left Behind\n\n•Pros (What I Miss):\n\n•\"Ecosystem magic\" is not a myth, but a reality. It's not just a set of features, but an invisible fabric that connects the family. I acutely felt this when I realized I could no longer see my wife's phone battery charge (a symbol of care) and disappeared from our shared fitness competition (a symbol of play and unity).\n\n•Flawless simplicity (\"It just works\"). AirPods connecting with animation, passwords autofilling without glitches, stable battery performance after updates. This reliability is not \"boring,\" but reassuring. It brings peace of mind, freeing my brain from having to \"fix\" basic things.\n\n•Predictability as an advantage. I always know what to expect. No unpleasant surprises, like a sudden battery drain or strange sleep metrics on the watch after an update. It's a world without rollercoasters.\n\n•Camera philosophy. The iPhone camera strives for a \"cinematic\" reality. It creates volumetric, pleasing-to-the-eye photos immediately, without the need to \"tinker\" with settings.\n\n•Well-designed password system. Passwords seemed like a simple app. But it's so well-designed that you don't need to remember many passwords; importantly, it generates passwords itself and works across other devices.\n\n•Integrated calls and messages. The ability to call other messengers from the built-in call app and a convenient built-in messaging app.\n\n•Health and fitness synchronization. Easy synchronization of a fitness tracker and app with the built-in health app.\n\n•Battery life. I'm impressed that such a small battery lasts an active day. No need to turn off Bluetooth and WiFi to save power.\n\n•User care. Features related to health, diary, and headphone usage monitoring.\n\n•Sound quality. Good sound from the speakers and the phone itself.\n\n•Size and dimensions. Exactly what I was looking for.\n\n•Face ID. A very convenient feature, especially at work where fingerprint unlock might be inconvenient.\n\n•Seamless Bluetooth connection. No problems connecting to Bluetooth devices.\n\n•Reminders. The \"Reminders\" app is very helpful for organizing thoughts and tasks.\n\n•Cons (Why I Left):\n\n•\"Golden cage.\" The feeling of being locked in. Dependence on AirDrop, iMessage, lack of flexibility. The desire to break free and try something new was incredibly strong.\n\n•Illusion of innovation. Annual updates brought minimal changes but cost maximum money. It felt like a waste.\n\n•Lack of control. I can't customize the system to my liking. I'm forced to live by Apple's rules. This is annoying when I know there could be something better and more convenient for me.\n\n•Notification limitations. Inability to change notification sounds in Instagram and Viber.\n\n•Browser limitations. On iPhone, you can't choose which browser to open news from the Google News app, which leads to a lot of ads.\n\nSamsung (Android/One UI): The World I Chose\n\n•Pros (What I'm Fighting For):\n\n•True freedom and customization. The ability to customize everything — from the desktop to system functions via Good Lock. It's the feeling that you are the master of your device. It's my own home where I choose the wall color.\n\n•Powerful, ahead-of-its-time innovations. Galaxy AI, enhanced camera capabilities (after configuration), DeX. I feel like I'm using the technologies of the future today.\n\n•Sense of uniqueness. I'm not \"one of the crowd.\" My choice is conscious and differs from the mainstream. This brings a certain intellectual satisfaction.\n\n•Small things that make life easier. A more convenient messenger, a better keyboard, no \"crutches\" for basic things (like listening to music from the browser).\n\n•System openness. The ability to install modded YouTube and YouTube Music apps, which works great.\n\n•Circle to Search. The on-screen search function works great.\n\n•Watch integration. Notifications from my device work on my watch, which was an important factor.\n\n•Step transfer. Steps from the phone are transferred to the watch, allowing me to see full activity statistics.\n\n•Browser control. The ability to uncheck \"open in built-in browser\" for news, which helps avoid ads.\n\n•Cons (The Harsh Truth):\n\n•Freedom requires work. Customization is not only joy but also a necessity. Sometimes this necessity turns into \"repair.\" When I have to fix basic functions (battery, sleep tracking) after an update, it's no longer \"customization\" but fixing manufacturer errors.\n\n•Fragility of innovations. The latest features can be \"raw\" and break. This undermines trust. I expect stability from a flagship but get beta testing for my own money.\n\n•Emotional isolation. The most significant drawback. I fall out of familiar family \"digital rituals.\" This creates a feeling of loneliness and makes me wonder if technological freedom is worth this emotional price.\n\n•Camera quality. Photos come out \"flat,\" without the depth or volume that iPhone has. Videos are also not top-notch. I want the phone to do this for me, not force me to \"play with photos.\" iPhone handles this, even the 13 Pro.\n\n•UI appearance. The iPhone's lock screen looks better.\n\n•Reminders and calendar. Reminder events don't appear in the calendar by default, and while there are workarounds, it feels like a \"crutch.\"\n\n•Weather app. The iPhone's weather app is more detailed; Samsung just redirects to a web page.\n\n•Passwords. The built-in password app doesn't always work on time or connect to save new passwords. I had to install Bitwarden.\n\n•Watch. Although notifications work, auto-tracking for cycling didn't start, and heart rate shows incorrectly during elliptical workouts.\n\n# Part II: The Main Conclusion I Reached\n\nI realized that my choice wasn't between two phones. It was a choice between two life priorities: personal technological freedom and seamless family integration.\n\nI left iPhone because I valued the first. I started to miss it because I underestimated the importance of the second.\n\nThe problem isn't that Samsung is bad and iPhone is good. The problem is that an ideal world where there is both absolute freedom and absolute integration with family on another platform does not exist. And each of us is forced to choose which of these two values is more important to us at a given moment in life.\n\nMy struggle is not an attempt to prove that Samsung is better. It's an attempt to find a way to \"build bridges\" between my new free world and the cozy \"digital home\" where my family remained. And I don't know yet if I will succeed.\n\nMy choice of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was wise, economically justified, and aligns with my desire for innovation and freedom. The only thing I need to do is give myself permission to fully transition to Samsung. Stop comparing and start enjoying my new device. True perfectionism is not demanding an ideal, but achieving maximum comfort with minimal expenditure of resources (time, money, nerves). That's exactly what I did.",

She has Play Protect disabled, for scanning, warning and sending unknown apps to Google for improved detections, yet it not only triggered, but was able to disable an app.\n\nIs there a provision in some license agreement allowing this to happen? I don't mind Play Protect, but even if the app had a malicious component, these autonomous actions go against one's choices and autonomy.\n\n---\n\nShe's quite upset, having played the game for years, but I told her that if the app itself isn't in the Play Store anymore (it doesn't show up for me) perhaps there's more to it than just being a game, even if Android itself is rather good at segmenting what each application can access.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI’ve been using an iPhone 17 Pro Max for a few weeks, mainly for content creation (Reels, short cinematic clips, fitness/gym stuff, and occasional fire performances) — and while the camera quality is amazing, the file transfer and workflow side is driving me insane.\n\nI edit both on my phone (CapCut) and PC (Windows). iCloud + iTunes + “Save to Photos” steps feel like a nightmare compared to simple drag-and-drop or Google Drive sync on Android. It honestly kills the efficiency of my whole process.\n\nSo now I’m looking to switch back to Android and want your advice on what’s currently the best phone for video creators in 2025.\nI care most about:\n\t•\t🎥 Video quality (1×/2×) and realistic color for quick IG posts\n\t•\t⚙️ Simple file transfer to PC (no cloud hoops)\n\t•\t📱 Stable performance for 4K clips and CapCut/LumaFusion editing\n\t•\t🔋 Battery / heat management for 10–20 min recordings\n\t•\t⚡ Optional: good telephoto for stage/fire show shots\n\nFrom what I’ve seen:\n\t•\tPixel 10 Pro looks closest to iPhone-style auto color/WB but maybe underpowered?\n\t•\tS25 Ultra seems unbeatable for tele and versatility.\n\t•\tXiaomi 15 Ultra has crazy creative potential, but I’m not sure about reliability or color accuracy straight out of camera.\n\nSo, if you’ve tested these (or any others) for content creation, what’s your pick?\nWhat are you using for video workflow → edit → upload right now?\nAny tips for making Android as “ready-to-post” as iPhone would be super appreciated 🙏",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Compared to traditional Linux distros, Android is very restricted, the newer versions even more so, it is very hard to root too. So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Has *anyone in the general public* actually received their Titan 2 yet?\n2. If yes, how’s it holding up — build quality, battery, keyboard feel, software stability, camera, etc.?\n3. Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

I asked Google Support for objective technical evidence (report, photos, LCI readings, methodology, technician ID, etc.), but they said they don’t have any documentation or photos, since the device was returned immediately after I declined the quote.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2019/771 (transposed in Portugal as Decree-Law 84/2021), sellers must provide technical proof when excluding warranty due to alleged misuse — otherwise, the fault is presumed to have existed at delivery.\n\nThe case was escalated to a “second-line” team three days ago, but I haven’t received any update.\n\nHas anyone in the EU experienced a similar situation with Google repairs? Were you able to get photos, a technical report, or have the decision overturned?\n\nI just want a transparent and evidence-based assessment — nothing more, nothing less.",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Recently, I was searching for flip phone reviews and saw an article on the Vertu website. The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

Not having much luck troubleshooting online, so if anyone has suggestions for either of these, help would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n1. No longer autocompleting Google searches. The phone asked if I wanted to sync information across devices, which I thought I'd done on my last one, so I said yes. Since agreeing to that, I no longer get autocomplete/suggested searches for Google searches (on my phone or on my laptop). When I start typing a question, all that comes up is my own previous queries. I do have the Trending Search setting turned on. I also tried turning on the personalized autocomplete setting, but all that did was start including websites I have saved to my bookmarks. I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, and restarting the phone, but nothing helps \n\n2. Discover won't go away. I've ensured the discover setting is off, but I still get an MSN-style list of news stories every time I open a new tab or spend time away from a tab (I come back to it, and the content is minimized with an option to pick back up where I left off... with an MSN-style list of stories beneath it). This one is still working correctly on my laptop (no stories shown to me there), but it's making me a bit nuts that it won't go away on the Pixel. Again here, I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, restarting the phone, to no avail.\n\nThanks again for any tips!",

With every new update it seems our customization  options keep dwindling and the options for changing colors and themes gets worse and worse. For example with the new update I hate the semi-transparent background to my launcher and notification menu and I want it back to white but no option now. I used to use custom launchers back in the day but they seem more finicky and glitchy with newer phones. I loved Android because I could customize everything to fit my personality and now they're making us like Apple. It feels like the same pull to minimalism and sad beige aesthetic that is plaguing homes and businesses (looking at you McDonald's and Taco Bell) now a days. All personality is being sucked out. I want choices without needing a custom launcher. ",

My last phone was a Nothing 2a and the ones before that were primary Xiaomi phones. I never had a feeling of finishednes and high quality in my hands before. Although the Chip and the battery aren't the best on a or specifically this foldable, I always wanted one and went all in. I love everything about it and even the noticeable grace of this foldable is rather pleasant to me, I wanted a foldable, I got one, and it only reminds me of the fact that it's foldable.\n\nNow to the rent part of this post, the camera. I'm not a camera guy at all. The years before I didn't even transport or safe my pictures before changing the phone so I lost them every time. It was nothing memorable, just pictures of things to remind me of or something.\nBut with pixel, as it was considered the best phone camera for a long time, I thought, I'd look into it. It looks well done as everything does, but why can't I have the option to just shoot raw in the full, advertised 48mp?\n\nEvery other pixel phone has the option as far as I know and even Gemini told me that it's there, even after the proof of multiple screenshots. It just sounds like a no brainer to just not included the option because, why not.\nI read things online about pixel binging and all the different stuff, but after all, let the people decide what they want after they paid about 1800€ for a brand new phone with the camera of lasts gen, which, btw. had the option to select 48mp raw.\nI won't really need it, it just noticed it and got pissed off, because when I shoot pictures, I also want raw in full quality!\n\nWhy Google, just why? It's such a small thing and yet so dumb!\n\nIf I'm missing something, please correct me!",

The past two years I switched to the Apple echosystem.. I actually really liked it because it brought me back to the basics and it managed to handle basic task very very very good. Build quality felt amazing and the camera's were amazing. Because of some compatibilty issues with work I had to switch to Android. Again, choosing the Samsung over every other phone because of the looks and performance (on paper). \n\nI realised that the Apple Echosystem is very restrictive so I don't think I will ever switch back to Apple again.\n\nSo here I am... looking into a Pixel because it really gives me Apple vibes, as if Samsung and the iPhone had a baby.\n\nSo, I have a few questions before I consider taking the Pixel (I think I will wait for the Pixel 11):\n\n1. How is the camera? I really like taking Portrait pictures with my phone.  \n2. I had a few moments with the Pixel in a phone store but I couldn't get all out. But it looked to me like as if the widgets were very limited. I normally use the weather widget and the google agenda widget on my homescreen, the google agenda widget on the Samsung shows the full month with the daily tasks on the screen. It didnt look like Pixel has the same widget option. Does anyone know wether this is customizable?  \n3. How is gaming on the Pixel? I sometimes like to play games like Genshin Impact or Wuthering Waves\n\nThank you all",

    "title": "Pixel 9 gap between screen and frame + other potential issues, should I RMA?",
    "selftext": "Purchased a Pixel 9 about a month ago while on vacation in another country because my previous phone gave out. I noticed that there is a noticeable gap between the screen and the frame (enough to slot a piece of paper in), mostly uniform but slightly more pronounced at the bottom. The screen is also ever so slightly raised up from frame level.\n\nI didn't request for the device to be replaced because I was due to leave for the country I live in in just a few days, also because there was conflicting information online on whether this was normal or not.\n\nI also recently noticed that sometimes there's this faint cluster of pixels flashing green just under the selfie camera cutout (happens only on lower brightness settings), although I'm not sure if it's a hardware issue because I haven't seen it before, and I would definitely have noticed it before if it happened. I don't think it's dead/stuck pixels either because I don't see this happening when I view solid colours on the screen. Also since this phone has a Samsung display and not a BOE one, so the chances are lower. It's usually intermittent but it has stopped happening for now.\n\nI also understand that the gap probably won't void the water resistance because it's not the size of the gap that protects the device, rather the glue under the screen that attaches the display to the frame.\n\nAnyway, I contacted Google support today, and the support agent was more than willing to start an RMA when I asked for it, and said they'd send a brand new replacement. They also said they'd reject the RMA if they found physical damage on my current device.\n\nNow I'm just confused if it's worth attempting an RMA because the phone seems to be working fine and the gap probably doesn't affect water resistance. Besides, there's a couple hairline scratches on the screen, hard to find, but they're there. \n\nI'm afraid the RMA might get rejected because of this and apparently the whole process may take 5-10 business days. Don't want to have to factory reset my phone and wait so long only for it to get rejected.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Does anyone here have experience RMA-ing Pixels in Germany?\n\nPictures of how the gap looks: https://imgur.com/a/GUKiaK1 (zoom in for a better look)",

    "selftext": "It's been 3 weeks since my Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold started having multiple problems. It's been 3 weeks since I've been going back an forth with Google over this phone. I bought the phone brand new about 3 months ago and it has been great until these last 3 weeks. These are my problems. \n\n1.      The SIM reader stopped reading my SIM suddenly\n\n2.      The Front screen started glitching and sometimes won’t come on\n\n3.      The phone overheats every time I use it\n\n4.      The phone doesn’t receive charge when unfolded\n\n5.      The camera app causes the phone to hang/crash\n\n6.      If restarted, the phone may not come one until after 12 hours of repeated attempts at turning it on\n\n7.      The phone just goes off on its own.\n\nAt first, Google had me send my phone to a google affiliated repair center who stated that the only problem with the phone was a small scratch and so the warranty had been removed. To fix the phone, I was given a quote for EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!!   \nI requested to have my phone returned and reached out to Google support again. This time, I was asked to take pictures of the phone and send it to the Google support again. The agent looked at the phone and stated that there were scratches to the phone's body, camera and inner screen. What he saw were left over stickies from the phone living in a Spigen body armor. \n\nI spoke to another agent who just cut the phone on me and did not call back. After speaking to 5 different Google support agents, one agent finally agreed to have me send the phone to Google's very own technicians in Warsaw Poland. Within a day, I received a report that there was a dent on the inner screen and that the warranty had been removed and to fix it, I HAD TO PAY A THIRD OF WHAT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!! No report was given with regards the 7 problems the phone had. \n\nIt's been 3 weeks since this problem started, 3 weeks without a phone, 3 weeks of putting my sim in my wife's phone just to check my notifications. 3 weeks of going around in circles with Google support. \n\nStill I haven't gotten any report about the 7 problems with the phone. Before this phone, I've been with Samsung for the past 17 years and I had no problems with their service whatsoever. Honestly I'm starting to regret leaving Samsung. \n\nAt the moment, I still do not have a phone, I'm still going back and forth with Google agents and so far, only one agent has brought up the option of a replacement and for that to occur, they have to check the warranty. \n\nPlease if you have experienced this problem or anything similar, what happens next? Will Google replace the phone? And if the answer is Yes (I hope), how long will it take. \n\nMy productivity has received a massive dent as a result of all this. I have had countless sleepless nights because of this. \n\nGoogle, please, this is not how to treat humans. This is totally unfair. ",

    "selftext": "Title says it all. My iPhone 13 mini does a solid job for a daily user. Since the iOS 26 update, it heats up like crazy, and is still very fidgety. I like my 13 Mini. It has gotten the job done since 2021. I am not a gamer, not a hardcore photographer, but do use it for audio, YouTube, and the basics. Most, if not all my apps are Google Apps, so I think the transition will be easier, but you never know. I decided to switch because of the following:\n\n* My life does not revolve around the Apple ecosystem (even though I have a Mac)\n* I use Google Apps DAILY\n* Don't give a shit about iMessage or Facetime. I actually HATE any video calls lol.\n* My 13 mini is getting old in technology and super laggy.\n* I was able to get the Pixel 10PRO 256gb for only $2 more a month, AND keep my mini. My new bill is only $64 and I could not pass this deal.\n* If I don't like the Pixel, I can return it, get my money back, and switch back to my mini.\n\nI have a feeling I am going to love the Pixel 10PRO. I am NOT anti iPhone. I am NOT anti Android. I just wanted to try Android again after 13 years. The Pixel 10 Pro fit the bill for what I was looking for. With that being said, the phone arrived today. I will setup later today and report back in a couple weeks. If anyone has some tips, tricks, or suggestions on setting up, please let me know. I have read other threads as well with PRO/ANTI iPhone/Androind content. I thought to myself, guys, it's just a phone... Thank you!",

    "title": "What To Do When Your Pixel Phone is Stuck in Fastboot Mode [Guide]",
    "selftext": "My Pixel phone got accidentally stuck in fastboot mode, and it was one of the most annoying situations one could get into, where I was stuck with a single message on screen and nothing was working. Even the Google support team was of no great help, and all my data was certain to be lost. Somehow, after a lot of sweat and tears, I was able to crack the problem by collecting little tips from various parts of the internet. As there isn't much helpful advice available, I decided to write a guide post for anyone in the future who gets stuck in a similar situation as mine.\n\n**Note - Skip to the TLDR at the end of the post if you want a simple, direct instruction on how to follow up.**\n\n# Context:\n\nMy Pixel 6a was having issues with the **Volume Down(-)** button, which either seemed to never work or work on its own all of a sudden. Initially, I didn't consider it a big issue until today, when my phone's battery died, and after rebooting, it suddenly entered the infamous Fastboot Mode (I suspect it was because the Volume Down button started acting on its own while simultaneously being pressed with the Power button).\n\nAt first, this didn't seem like a big problem until I realised what the actual mess I was in. My phone didn't seem to do anything, and I was stuck with a single message on screen like[ (this)](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-forums-api/attachment/thread-282377112-7952556128442379489.jpg). With notable information being:\n\n\\- Start message next to the power button\n\n\\- Device status: locked\n\n\\- Enter reason: vol down pressed\n\nNow there was another message next to the volume buttons, which said 'Press the volume keys to select a different menu,' but my device would literally do nothing. It wouldn't change the options when I press the volume keys. Holding the power button would do nothing. The screen would only show this single thing, and nothing would work. It won't even turn on and off. My whole phone was frozen and felt useless. I even let the battery die in the hope that when I would boot it again, everything would go back to normal, but nope, it was still the same screen.\n\n# Google's response:\n\nEventually, I called into Google's helpline to ask for assistance. The Google agent assigned to me was nice but didn't prove to be very helpful as he told me that my phone's software had crashed, from what he could understand on the call, and that I would need to get it repaired from Google's official service centre. Now the problem was that I was in my hometown on vacation, and it would take me another week to go back to the city where their centre is located. That being said, time was still not the major issue because the agent said that there was a 90% chance that all my data would get erased, and that was the dealbreaker for me, cause I didn't want to lose any of the data and memories I had saved in my phone.\n\n# What Worked For Me:\n\nI was really hopeless. But like a drowning man clutching at straws, I was ready to try any advice that might work. On the internet, there was little to no helpful advice available, until I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/s/jijM57t5Af) lifesaver of a Reddit post by u/albogaster, and while I suggest reading the full post, I found these two videos ([ Vid 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTT0_mfCgDc) &[ Vid 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqhlzvzznXM)) by the YT channel **WorldOfTech** to be the most helpful.\n\nThe two videos basically explain to you:\n\n1.[ How to Boot into Android Recovery Menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTT0_mfCgDc)\n\n2.[ How to Exit 'Waiting on Rescue Command'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqhlzvzznXM)\n\nYou can check out both of these videos for your knowledge, but I will be including the tips gathered from these videos in the **'Step-by-Step Tutorial'** section of my **TLDR.**\n\nThere's another important video mentioned in the post ([Vid 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMaoXQkKy_w)) by YT channel **HardReset(dot)Info,** which explains to you how to enter[ Recovery Mode from Fastboot Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMaoXQkKy_w) that you should check out.\n\nNow, I knew what needed to be done, but still, my problem was that **my phone was literally frozen with no buttons working,** unlike the tutorials I had seen, where they at least had the option to navigate through volume buttons. That was until I came across[ this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/11e2jho/comment/ktc4tpt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) comment by u/Forsaken\\_Youth\\_924,1, which said:\n\n\\> hold power and volume up till it vibrates and resets, then hold volume down and power while it's off and click vol up once to get to that weird core command menu and use volume to go up or down, power to select\n\nSo that's what I did, I held the Power button with the Volume Up button for a good amount of 20 seconds, and **it turned off!**\n\nYay!! At least it did something! At least it did something other than being stuck on a single screen!\n\nNow that was progress.\n\nBut it was not long until I was disappointed again, because the next step wouldn't work. Nope. Nothing. It will come back to the same screen again. Tried pressing the Power button + Vol Down button for a good amount of time while it was still off. Didn't work. Tried pressing the Power button alone. Didn't work.\n\nI suspected that it must be because my Vol Down button is not working. But what do I do now? Do I get it repaired first? Is this gonna work at all?\n\nBut then I came across[ this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/11e2jho/comment/ksm7nlj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) other comment under the same thread, which advised to hit the volume down key as hard as you can, **and... it worked!** What in the world?! I didn't even expect the solution to my problem would be this simple. Just banged the Vol Down key across the table as hard as I could, then pressed the Power + Vol Down key while the screen was still off and voila, I was able to navigate the menu using the volume buttons.\n\nNow with that working, I selected the **Recovery Mode** option which bought me to a screen that said **'No Command'** and then using the information from the above videos, I went into the Recovery Mode Menu and selected the **Reboot System option** and finally there I reclaimed my phone from the devil's claw without losing any of my data and without paying the repairing charges.\n\nThanks to both u/albogaster and u/Forsaken\\_Youth\\_9241 without whom this wouldn't have been possible.\n\nFor those who want a step-by-step tutorial, please read the TLDR next.\n\n# TLDR\n\nGot locked into Fastboot mode and here's what helped me:\n\n**The Issue:**\n\n\\- Stuck in Fastboot mode\n\n\\- Not able to navigate in Fastboot mode\n\n\\- Volume Down Key not working\n\n\\- Device state: Locked\n\n\\- Enter reason: Vol down pressed\n\n**Step-by-Step Tutorial:**\n\n**- Step 1:** **Fix the Volume Down Button (if not working):** You gotta get it repaired, or maybe try banging it across the edge of a table really hard (worked for me). I know this sounds silly but it works and it's crucial for our process.\n\n**- Step 2: Reset the Fastboot Navigation setting** **(if not working):** Press and hold the **Power Button** and **Volume Up** button simultaneously for a long time (maybe 20 seconds or more). This will turn off the screen. Now press and hold the **Power button** and **Volume Down button** together. This will **reset** the Fastboot page, and you will now be able to navigate through the volume buttons.\n\n**- Step 3: Exit Fastboot Navigation:** With the volume buttons now working, press **Volume Down** button and navigate towards the **Recovery Mode** (not rescue mode) and press **Power Button** once. A Google logo will pop up, and you'll come across a screen that says **'No Command'**. Now, hold the **Power button** and while you're holding it press the **Volume Up botton 'once’,** and you will see a **menu** pop up.\n\n**- Step 4: Reboot System:** In the menu, navigate to the **'Reboot System Now'** option using the volume keys, and while it's selected, press the **Power button** ‘**once’,** and now it'll boot your screen normally. That's it!\n\nI know this was long, but I hope it was helpful.\n\nThanks.",

    "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI have a second hand Pixel 8 Pro that I bought a month ago and it was working great until I two days ago when I installed an urgent update by Pixel (I believe it was Android 16 (Build Number: BP3A.251005.004.B1). After a day and a half I woke to find my screen flickering and twitching and randomly turning off when I check certain colours or images (I suspect dark mode or anything remotely using dark colours)\n\nHere is a video of the issue: [Screen Flickering - Pixel Pro 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFg0WO_FcLI?si=bFy31aqzQIRG29NI)\n\nI googled the issue as it didn't make sense to me that a hardware issue would cause that in such a context, I suspect it is a software issue. Here is what I tried to no avail:\n\n-Rebooting the phone, even in Safe Mode\n-Taking off the screen protector\n-Disabling \"Smooth Display\" (120hz mode) and lowering the resolution to \"high resolution\"\n-Disabling \"Adaptive Brightness\" and keeping it at 30-40%\n-Accessing the developper options and disabling \"HW Overlays\"\n\nSo as you can see, I virtually tried everything except factory reset which I don't want to do for the time being. I opt-in in the Android Beta Program to see if a Beta OTA Update would help, still waiting for one at the moment.\n\nAt this point I'm worried it is hardware issue and since I live in Morocco I can't send it to Google nor benefit from an extended replacement program that Google provides in supported countries. In worst case scenario I can order a screen replacement from iFixit and see if I can find a repairman here in the local market to install it but before resorting to such a costly course of action, I'd like to see if someone managed to fix this issue before\n\nThank you in advance",

    "selftext": "What kind of issues have y'all had with your 9 folds? Personally, Everytime I get a new phone and see people reporting issues, I have never had those issues occur. But the amount of issues I've had with the 9 fold is ridiculous.\n\nHere's a list in order that mine has:\n\n1. Volume down button stopped working - can't turn down the volume using this button, can't screenshot\n\n2. Quick tap has stopped working - started to get less reactive, at first if I turned it off and on, it would work for a bit then would stop. Now it doesn't react at all. Randomly it would take screenshots on its own. I just turned it off completely.\n\n3. Camera has gotten worst at detecting and adjusting for light - under certain lighting conditions, it doesn't auto adjust accurately and there will be things that look like slightly off colored stripes going horizontally.\n\n4. Phone charges only when it is closed - If I open it, plugged in or not, the battery icon turns into a grayed out empty symbol with a question mark. It doesn't charge and battery health drops from 97% to 25%, only when it's open.\n\n5. Related to 4 possibly - it's become laggy and charges slowly over the course of one day after #4 started.\n\nLuckily, Google support has put in a ticket for me to take it to a repair center and get it repaired or replaced under warranty. The issue is that I am stationed overseas so have to send it to my parent in the US to take it to the repair center (there's none authorized near me) and then send it back to me.  Looking at about 2 months without the phone. Parent isn't technically savvy so low chance they'll be able to test it out prior to sending back to me.\n\nFortunately I have my old pixel 6 in a drawer that I can use.\n\nYour turn, what problems have y'all experienced?",

Which I'd rather no do, dont want to be without a phone for a few weeks and have to restore all my stuff.",

Not having much luck troubleshooting online, so if anyone has suggestions for either of these, help would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n1. No longer autocompleting Google searches. The phone asked if I wanted to sync information across devices, which I thought I'd done on my last one, so I said yes. Since agreeing to that, I no longer get autocomplete/suggested searches for Google searches (on my phone or on my laptop). When I start typing a question, all that comes up is my own previous queries. I do have the Trending Search setting turned on. I also tried turning on the personalized autocomplete setting, but all that did was start including websites I have saved to my bookmarks. I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, and restarting the phone, but nothing helps \n\n2. Discover won't go away. I've ensured the discover setting is off, but I still get an MSN-style list of news stories every time I open a new tab or spend time away from a tab (I come back to it, and the content is minimized with an option to pick back up where I left off... with an MSN-style list of stories beneath it). This one is still working correctly on my laptop (no stories shown to me there), but it's making me a bit nuts that it won't go away on the Pixel. Again here, I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, restarting the phone, to no avail.\n\nThanks again for any tips!",

It has gotten the job done since 2021. I am not a gamer, not a hardcore photographer, but do use it for audio, YouTube, and the basics. Most, if not all my apps are Google Apps, so I think the transition will be easier, but you never know. I decided to switch because of the following:\n\n* My life does not revolve around the Apple ecosystem (even though I have a Mac)\n* I use Google Apps DAILY\n* Don't give a shit about iMessage or Facetime. I actually HATE any video calls lol.\n* My 13 mini is getting old in technology and super laggy.\n* I was able to get the Pixel 10PRO 256gb for only $2 more a month, AND keep my mini. My new bill is only $64 and I could not pass this deal.\n* If I don't like the Pixel, I can return it, get my money back, and switch back to my mini.\n\nI have a feeling I am going to love the Pixel 10PRO. I am NOT anti iPhone. I am NOT anti Android. I just wanted to try Android again after 13 years. The Pixel 10 Pro fit the bill for what I was looking for. With that being said, the phone arrived today. I will setup later today and report back in a couple weeks. If anyone has some tips, tricks, or suggestions on setting up, please let me know. I have read other threads as well with PRO/ANTI iPhone/Androind content. I thought to myself, guys, it's just a phone... Thank you!",

It was nothing memorable, just pictures of things to remind me of or something.\nBut with pixel, as it was considered the best phone camera for a long time, I thought, I'd look into it. It looks well done as everything does, but why can't I have the option to just shoot raw in the full, advertised 48mp?\n\nEvery other pixel phone has the option as far as I know and even Gemini told me that it's there, even after the proof of multiple screenshots. It just sounds like a no brainer to just not included the option because, why not.\nI read things online about pixel binging and all the different stuff, but after all, let the people decide what they want after they paid about 1800€ for a brand new phone with the camera of lasts gen, which, btw. had the option to select 48mp raw.\nI won't really need it, it just noticed it and got pissed off, because when I shoot pictures, I also want raw in full quality!\n\nWhy Google, just why? It's such a small thing and yet so dumb!\n\nIf I'm missing something, please correct me!",

    "selftext": "It's been 3 weeks since my Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold started having multiple problems. It's been 3 weeks since I've been going back an forth with Google over this phone. I bought the phone brand new about 3 months ago and it has been great until these last 3 weeks. These are my problems. \n\n1.      The SIM reader stopped reading my SIM suddenly\n\n2.      The Front screen started glitching and sometimes won’t come on\n\n3.      The phone overheats every time I use it\n\n4.      The phone doesn’t receive charge when unfolded\n\n5.      The camera app causes the phone to hang/crash\n\n6.      If restarted, the phone may not come one until after 12 hours of repeated attempts at turning it on\n\n7.      The phone just goes off on its own.\n\nAt first, Google had me send my phone to a google affiliated repair center who stated that the only problem with the phone was a small scratch and so the warranty had been removed. To fix the phone, I was given a quote for EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!!   \nI requested to have my phone returned and reached out to Google support again. This time, I was asked to take pictures of the phone and send it to the Google support again. The agent looked at the phone and stated that there were scratches to the phone's body, camera and inner screen. What he saw were left over stickies from the phone living in a Spigen body armor. \n\nI spoke to another agent who just cut the phone on me and did not call back. After speaking to 5 different Google support agents, one agent finally agreed to have me send the phone to Google's very own technicians in Warsaw Poland. Within a day, I received a report that there was a dent on the inner screen and that the warranty had been removed and to fix it, I HAD TO PAY A THIRD OF WHAT I AM PAYING FOR THE PHONE!!! No report was given with regards the 7 problems the phone had. \n\nIt's been 3 weeks since this problem started, 3 weeks without a phone, 3 weeks of putting my sim in my wife's phone just to check my notifications. 3 weeks of going around in circles with Google support. \n\nStill I haven't gotten any report about the 7 problems with the phone. Before this phone, I've been with Samsung for the past 17 years and I had no problems with their service whatsoever. Honestly I'm starting to regret leaving Samsung. \n\nAt the moment, I still do not have a phone, I'm still going back and forth with Google agents and so far, only one agent has brought up the option of a replacement and for that to occur, they have to check the warranty. \n\nPlease if you have experienced this problem or anything similar, what happens next? Will Google replace the phone? And if the answer is Yes (I hope), how long will it take. \n\nMy productivity has received a massive dent as a result of all this. I have had countless sleepless nights because of this. \n\nGoogle, please, this is not how to treat humans. This is totally unfair. ",

The past two years I switched to the Apple echosystem.. I actually really liked it because it brought me back to the basics and it managed to handle basic task very very very good. Build quality felt amazing and the camera's were amazing. Because of some compatibilty issues with work I had to switch to Android. Again, choosing the Samsung over every other phone because of the looks and performance (on paper). \n\nI realised that the Apple Echosystem is very restrictive so I don't think I will ever switch back to Apple again.\n\nSo here I am... looking into a Pixel because it really gives me Apple vibes, as if Samsung and the iPhone had a baby.\n\nSo, I have a few questions before I consider taking the Pixel (I think I will wait for the Pixel 11):\n\n1. How is the camera? I really like taking Portrait pictures with my phone.  \n2. I had a few moments with the Pixel in a phone store but I couldn't get all out. But it looked to me like as if the widgets were very limited. I normally use the weather widget and the google agenda widget on my homescreen, the google agenda widget on the Samsung shows the full month with the daily tasks on the screen. It didnt look like Pixel has the same widget option. Does anyone know wether this is customizable?  \n3. How is gaming on the Pixel? I sometimes like to play games like Genshin Impact or Wuthering Waves\n\nThank you all",

And what's the point of doing it on an unlocked phone if you can use an unlocked phone on any network? \n\nThe only reason I can think of is if some carrier rolled out Android xx earlier than another one so you can access it sooner by a few days or weeks but that seems not worth the risk of bricking your phone. \n\nCan cross flashing get rid of network restrictions? Or do you need to swap logic boards for that? ",

    "selftext": "I'm just sad, I've always been an android user and we always had more customization options than Apple. With every new update it seems our customization  options keep dwindling and the options for changing colors and themes gets worse and worse. For example with the new update I hate the semi-transparent background to my launcher and notification menu and I want it back to white but no option now. I used to use custom launchers back in the day but they seem more finicky and glitchy with newer phones. I loved Android because I could customize everything to fit my personality and now they're making us like Apple. It feels like the same pull to minimalism and sad beige aesthetic that is plaguing homes and businesses (looking at you McDonald's and Taco Bell) now a days. All personality is being sucked out. I want choices without needing a custom launcher. ",

Not having much luck troubleshooting online, so if anyone has suggestions for either of these, help would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n1. No longer autocompleting Google searches. The phone asked if I wanted to sync information across devices, which I thought I'd done on my last one, so I said yes. Since agreeing to that, I no longer get autocomplete/suggested searches for Google searches (on my phone or on my laptop). When I start typing a question, all that comes up is my own previous queries. I do have the Trending Search setting turned on. I also tried turning on the personalized autocomplete setting, but all that did was start including websites I have saved to my bookmarks. I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, and restarting the phone, but nothing helps \n\n2. Discover won't go away. I've ensured the discover setting is off, but I still get an MSN-style list of news stories every time I open a new tab or spend time away from a tab (I come back to it, and the content is minimized with an option to pick back up where I left off... with an MSN-style list of stories beneath it). This one is still working correctly on my laptop (no stories shown to me there), but it's making me a bit nuts that it won't go away on the Pixel. Again here, I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, restarting the phone, to no avail.\n\nThanks again for any tips!",

    "selftext": "Title says it all. My iPhone 13 mini does a solid job for a daily user. Since the iOS 26 update, it heats up like crazy, and is still very fidgety. I like my 13 Mini. It has gotten the job done since 2021. I am not a gamer, not a hardcore photographer, but do use it for audio, YouTube, and the basics. Most, if not all my apps are Google Apps, so I think the transition will be easier, but you never know. I decided to switch because of the following:\n\n* My life does not revolve around the Apple ecosystem (even though I have a Mac)\n* I use Google Apps DAILY\n* Don't give a shit about iMessage or Facetime. I actually HATE any video calls lol.\n* My 13 mini is getting old in technology and super laggy.\n* I was able to get the Pixel 10PRO 256gb for only $2 more a month, AND keep my mini. My new bill is only $64 and I could not pass this deal.\n* If I don't like the Pixel, I can return it, get my money back, and switch back to my mini.\n\nI have a feeling I am going to love the Pixel 10PRO. I am NOT anti iPhone. I am NOT anti Android. I just wanted to try Android again after 13 years. The Pixel 10 Pro fit the bill for what I was looking for. With that being said, the phone arrived today. I will setup later today and report back in a couple weeks. If anyone has some tips, tricks, or suggestions on setting up, please let me know. I have read other threads as well with PRO/ANTI iPhone/Androind content. I thought to myself, guys, it's just a phone... Thank you!",

    "selftext": "So, I'm not sure yet, but this might end up being a rent post.\nI switched to Google Pixel about 4 days ago and I've never been happier. My last phone was a Nothing 2a and the ones before that were primary Xiaomi phones. I never had a feeling of finishednes and high quality in my hands before. Although the Chip and the battery aren't the best on a or specifically this foldable, I always wanted one and went all in. I love everything about it and even the noticeable grace of this foldable is rather pleasant to me, I wanted a foldable, I got one, and it only reminds me of the fact that it's foldable.\n\nNow to the rent part of this post, the camera. I'm not a camera guy at all. The years before I didn't even transport or safe my pictures before changing the phone so I lost them every time. It was nothing memorable, just pictures of things to remind me of or something.\nBut with pixel, as it was considered the best phone camera for a long time, I thought, I'd look into it. It looks well done as everything does, but why can't I have the option to just shoot raw in the full, advertised 48mp?\n\nEvery other pixel phone has the option as far as I know and even Gemini told me that it's there, even after the proof of multiple screenshots. It just sounds like a no brainer to just not included the option because, why not.\nI read things online about pixel binging and all the different stuff, but after all, let the people decide what they want after they paid about 1800€ for a brand new phone with the camera of lasts gen, which, btw. had the option to select 48mp raw.\nI won't really need it, it just noticed it and got pissed off, because when I shoot pictures, I also want raw in full quality!\n\nWhy Google, just why? It's such a small thing and yet so dumb!\n\nIf I'm missing something, please correct me!",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn.

Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two?

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

I eventually switched to iPhone with the 12 Pro, and 5 years later it still feels just as smooth as the day I got it.\n\nNow I’m considering going back to Android with the S26, but I don’t want to deal with the same old performance issues if Samsung hasn’t really fixed this.\n\nFor those of you who’ve stuck with Samsung in recent years, how does long-term performance hold up? Are they still prone to slowing down or is it finally on par with iOS for longevity?",

They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I’ve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

Btw the objective was to see which Magic Eraser works better. Although Samsungs eraser was sooo much better... but on a different picture. Because my camera couldn't capture one vehicle in the background clearly.\n\nI do have Quick Tap Shutter on and Prioritize Focus over speed off. I thought Samsung could do better because it's pretty much iPhone 15 or 16 equivalent. Idk I thought camera was kinda close to iPhone but phone camers, i think iPhone wins hands down.",

Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Hello redditors!\n\nI have previously asked in this community if it's worth purchasing the Galaxy Watch 4 LTE 44mm refurbished for around 80$, and most people said I should I go search for an another model at around the same price. So while looking today, I found a lot of Galaxy Watch 7 40mm LTE listings for around 100$ - 120$. My question is if it's worth getting it for that price? One seller even said it's almost brand new, and it's been used for only 5 days, another said it's been rarely used. And for the price tag, plus the LTE feature, and being a relatively new flagship model (last year is was a flagship watch), I think it's worth to go for it. What do you guys think? Or should I get it, or should I go for Watch 6, 5, or an older model?\n\nMy question is if it's worth getting the Watch 7 LTE 40mm for this price tag? Is the battery relatively good, especially with LTE ON? Or does the Galaxy Watch 4 44mm or other older watches perform better? What about the experience, is it lag-free, what sensors does it have compared to older models, and why should I get it over an older model? And will it be any difference if using it with a Galaxy phone or not? And, jumping from a Galaxy Fit 3 to this watch would be a major difference? And if anything, how much does a battery swap cost?\n\nThanks in advance for helping me out!\n\n  \nEDIT 1: I forgot to mention, does this watch have comfortable straps and a comfortable design compared to older models?",

Long story short, i receive an email today, pretty vague, saying that the watch is not repairable, so they will refund my purchase. I have a Fit 3, but i really got used to all the premium features of the Ultra and the relatively decent battery life. A new 2025 Ultra is almost $700 with tax.

Under Sounds and Vibrations, I see 2 relevant settings:  \n\\- \"Vibration\" (Longs/Short and Light/Strong)  \n\\- \"Notification Vibration\"\n\nFrom my understanding the latter one is the vibration pattern and the former one is the Intensity controls. But does it (\"Vibration\") control the intensity of only the notifications, or something else as well as it doesn't exclusively mention notifications?\n\nBesides what controls the Vibration settings for \"Phone Alarms\" - are they treated like notifications as they are originally from the phone? Is it independent of the controls mentioned above? If yes, how is Vibration settings for \"Phone Alarms\" controlled - the intensity, pattern and even ON/OFF?\n\nThanks.",

When the watch transfer (watch 3) came, i started the od process of-back up the watch to samsung cloud-erase the info from the watch-connect to the new phone. The old watches had to go this way unfortunately, since there was no button to transfer the watch without this. After finishing all of this i cannot find the back up anywhere, nor my purchased things anywhere on the samsung store. Its driving me crazy, this is exactly what i thought would happen. I dont really care for the back up, as much as i care about the watch face ive lost. Ive found an old screenshot(included), i think its called IV style, tho i cannot find it anywhere. \nNow my question is: is there anybody that could help me with getting that watch face back? Doubt that we're able to get the back up, so thats all im asking😆",

    "selftext": "Hello redditors!\n\nI have previously asked in this community if it's worth purchasing the Galaxy Watch 4 LTE 44mm refurbished for around 80$, and most people said I should I go search for an another model at around the same price. So while looking today, I found a lot of Galaxy Watch 7 40mm LTE listings for around 100$ - 120$. My question is if it's worth getting it for that price? One seller even said it's almost brand new, and it's been used for only 5 days, another said it's been rarely used. And for the price tag, plus the LTE feature, and being a relatively new flagship model (last year is was a flagship watch), I think it's worth to go for it. What do you guys think? Or should I get it, or should I go for Watch 6, 5, or an older model?\n\nMy question is if it's worth getting the Watch 7 LTE 40mm for this price tag? Is the battery relatively good, especially with LTE ON? Or does the Galaxy Watch 4 44mm or other older watches perform better? What about the experience, is it lag-free, what sensors does it have compared to older models, and why should I get it over an older model? And will it be any difference if using it with a Galaxy phone or not? And, jumping from a Galaxy Fit 3 to this watch would be a major difference? And if anything, how much does a battery swap cost?\n\nThanks in advance for helping me out!\n\n  \nEDIT 1: I forgot to mention, does this watch have comfortable straps and a comfortable design compared to older models?",

A week later, i went to check on the status of my repair and it says it's been cancelled. Sure enough, I call again, some support person tells me that I will be contacted within 24 - 72 hours by someone to discuss my options. Long story short, i receive an email today, pretty vague, saying that the watch is not repairable, so they will refund my purchase. I have a Fit 3, but i really got used to all the premium features of the Ultra and the relatively decent battery life. A new 2025 Ultra is almost $700 with tax. I have no idea what was wrong with my watch and now I'm terrified that it might happen again.",

Restored back up on watch. \n\nAny ideas from the sub on next troubleshooting steps? If not, I'll just send it in to Samsung for them to determine if I got a lemon and there is a problem with the Bluetooth chip. ",

I was wanting to know if anyone on here who might own the sports band, I have the watch 8 classic and am considering the sports band. I switched from Apple to Android and I really liked the way the Apple watch band touched underneath itself and from the pictures it looks like the sports band for the Galaxy watch does the same thing. Any and all input is greatly appreciated thank you!",

    "selftext": "Hello redditors!\n\nI have previously asked in this community if it's worth purchasing the Galaxy Watch 4 LTE 44mm refurbished for around 80$, and most people said I should I go search for an another model at around the same price. So while looking today, I found a lot of Galaxy Watch 7 40mm LTE listings for around 100$ - 120$. My question is if it's worth getting it for that price? One seller even said it's almost brand new, and it's been used for only 5 days, another said it's been rarely used. And for the price tag, plus the LTE feature, and being a relatively new flagship model (last year is was a flagship watch), I think it's worth to go for it. What do you guys think? Or should I get it, or should I go for Watch 6, 5, or an older model?\n\nMy question is if it's worth getting the Watch 7 LTE 40mm for this price tag? Is the battery relatively good, especially with LTE ON? Or does the Galaxy Watch 4 44mm or other older watches perform better? What about the experience, is it lag-free, what sensors does it have compared to older models, and why should I get it over an older model? And will it be any difference if using it with a Galaxy phone or not? And, jumping from a Galaxy Fit 3 to this watch would be a major difference? And if anything, how much does a battery swap cost?\n\nThanks in advance for helping me out!\n\n  \nEDIT 1: I forgot to mention, does this watch have comfortable straps and a comfortable design compared to older models?",

Atm I using the M4 MacBook Pro. \n\nWith smartphones, I've settled into the Nothing ecosystem.\n\nBut what's available in the notebook space? I find [Frame.work](http://Frame.work) relatively interesting, but they're already very expensive. And that's where it ends, it seems to me.\n\nI just don't want traditional brands like Asus, Acer, etc. I don't even want those things.\n\nAnd I can't imagine using a Chromebook in my everyday life. Although I really like the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, as an exception to the brand. But a Chromebook is absolutely unusable offline.",

    "selftext": "OK, here we go. I know I will get several opinions, but after doing tons of research, getting chatGPT's help, and reading one Reddit thread after another I am thoroughly confused. I currently have an Asus Zenbook Pro 15 Flib OLED. I've had it just 2 months shy of 3 years now and end of last month it started intermittently booting straight into UEFI (BIOS). The keyboard is also giving me problems (some keys not working unless I push down hard), I lose my screen for a few seconds when I plug it in while it's running, and it won't charge on one of the outlets in our house (everything else works fine on that outlet).\n\nGeek squad wants $149.99 for just a diagnostic or $179.99 for a one-year membership, but can't tell me if I would need to buy parts without doing the diagnostic. Given all of the issues, and the fact that I have had it almost 3 years, I started looking at laptops and have landed on this one (possibly):  \nLenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 2025 Copilot+ PC with Intel Core Ultra 7 256V Processor, 1TB SSD, Yoga Pen, 14” WUXGA OLED Dolby Vision® Touchscreen, 16GB LPDDR5x-8533 Memory, 5MP IR Cam, Wi-Fi 7, and Win11 Pro  \n[https://a.co/d/gamnGK4](https://a.co/d/gamnGK4)\n\nI was just about to order this one when I decided to read another Reddit thread on this very model from 10 months ago, and one person said it's not great for Zoom b/c the audio is horrible and the video quality is not good. Another person said it \"screams,\" meaning the fan is really loud.\n\nWell, I run three 2-hour Zoom meetings every week, plus additional 1 hour meetings depending on what I have going on. In addition, I mostly use my laptop to create basic canva designs for IG and FB posts, minimal video editing, basic Google drive/Gmail functions, Zoom meetings, Zapier, Thrivecart, etc. My current Asus has been perfect for my needs. Battery life is important.\n\nWould love some suggestions. Ideally, I would like to spend no more than $1,200. Some questions:  \n1. How important is OLED?\n\n2. Seems 16GB is sufficient for what I do or should I go with 32 GB?\n\n3. Processor recommendations?\n\nThank you,\n\nK",

Computer still functions, but sometimes the screen falls all the way back. \n\nIt’s not in warranty, and repair shops are quoting her $400-$500 for the repair. Her computer is an HP ENVY x360 15.6 inch 2-in-1 Laptop PC 15-ew1000 (794COAV).\n\nShe’s going into law school so she was looking at getting a Microsoft Surface, but the model she was looking at has lower specs than her computer. She was hoping to trade this one in, but obviously she isn’t going to get much in trade-in value for a laptop with a broken hinge.\n\nI was wondering if there’s any way I can fix this myself or how difficult of a fix it would be. If anyone can give me advice, it would be greatly appreciated!",

And I know 65 is not a high enough temp to worry about but this just bothers me why this is a thing)\n\nI know CPUs utilize more power when plugged in but here's the weird part\nthis doesn't happen for games that are obviously more demanding like Outlast they stay around 55°c when plugged in.\n\nAnd for a game like steamworld dig or undertale that barely requires the CPU to do something, going to the 60s is very confusing to me. What's really annoying is that when I first booted Steamworld dig today the temps hovered around 52°c which made sense but then on my second time running it the temps are now at 67°c (I remember the same thing happening with hollow knight).\n\nI like using my laptop plugged in a lot so usually I'll prefer to play plugged in too, so this gets very annoying when I can feel the CPU warming up under my hand for no reason.\n\nSo yeah this probably sounds like a ramblings of a madman but please, make it make sense 🥺.",

Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** 2.500 euros\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** No, can't find much here where I live\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Same as a MacBook Pro M1 Pro - great construction quality, similar battery life when not doing work tasks (writing docs, light media, etc.). For gaming, I would only do it plugged.\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Same weight and thinness as a MacBook Pro M1 Pro. Do not need something paper thin, but don't want also a +6kg pc.\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 13-14'\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run**: Want to play games with it when plugged. Outside that - fast and smooth experience when doing media, work tasks like writing docs, light weight coding / vibe coding. Basically my current experience with my work MacBook Pro M1 Pro, but that can also game in Windows.\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 60Fps and at least 1080p is a must have. I'm using an Xbox Series X for more intensive games, but if I can play for example Oblivion Remastered well enough in 1080p 60fps with mods I'm more than happy. But it will be for indie/multiplayer pc exclusive games (mmorpgs, Mobas, etc...)\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Good keyboard is a must - something akin to what the MacBook Pro m1 offers. Not the best, but it is good enough for a solid experience. When gaming at home I will connect external screens (at least 2) and external keyboard. min 512gb ssd + 16/32 gb ram. If possible, 2k120hz screen, don't need 4k. reliable build quality for sure, after using this MacBook, I really care about a pc that won't explode by itself after a few years of use. At least +2 Usb C Ports, HDMI and a headphone jack\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** this is to be my daily driver - to work outside my main job and that can game whenever im missing something on xbox Series X or Switch.",

I know that it might be considered to strong with this specifications for „just study” but the price is really good and it would be nice to have it for a longer time. ",

It is not continuous, it happens sometimes when using something like VS code, or terminal but never while watching videos, movies, browsing web, reddit, etc. It goes away when i scroll, or screen refreshes,etc. I don't think my GPU is dying(probably!) as I have captured it in a screenshot. I have added the system infoormation in the 4th picture. It's a laptop, 15ACH6 (Ryzen 7 5800H+RTX 3060 Laptop; 170W Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3). Still using the original charging brick. Though the first time it happened, it happened for the whole screen as i was using my friend's 130W adapter. I do not have a MUX switch so I can't switch GPUs to check, happens with both external monitor and internal eDP display. Tried Reintalling the driver(clean) to no avail, though haven't tried with DDU and safe mode. Any help regarding this issue would be insanely helpful, as this is my only laptop and I can't afford another, as I am just a college student. I am on 23H2, with latest drivers btw.",

    "selftext": "So I've noticed something really weird on my laptop, it's an intel core i5 1335U with 8gb of ram, no GPU. And whenever I try to run certain games the temps go unnecessarily high, like for Undertale, hollow knight, Steamworld dig.\nWhen plugged in the temps usually jump back and forth between 60 - 68°c, but on battery they can go as low as 50°c (idle temps are at 46°c)\n\n(For the record my laptops temps are fine otherwise, so I don't think any cooling issues are there. And I know 65 is not a high enough temp to worry about but this just bothers me why this is a thing)\n\nI know CPUs utilize more power when plugged in but here's the weird part\nthis doesn't happen for games that are obviously more demanding like Outlast they stay around 55°c when plugged in.\n\nAnd for a game like steamworld dig or undertale that barely requires the CPU to do something, going to the 60s is very confusing to me. What's really annoying is that when I first booted Steamworld dig today the temps hovered around 52°c which made sense but then on my second time running it the temps are now at 67°c (I remember the same thing happening with hollow knight).\n\nI like using my laptop plugged in a lot so usually I'll prefer to play plugged in too, so this gets very annoying when I can feel the CPU warming up under my hand for no reason.\n\nSo yeah this probably sounds like a ramblings of a madman but please, make it make sense 🥺.",

    "selftext": "OK, here we go. I know I will get several opinions, but after doing tons of research, getting chatGPT's help, and reading one Reddit thread after another I am thoroughly confused. I currently have an Asus Zenbook Pro 15 Flib OLED. I've had it just 2 months shy of 3 years now and end of last month it started intermittently booting straight into UEFI (BIOS). The keyboard is also giving me problems (some keys not working unless I push down hard), I lose my screen for a few seconds when I plug it in while it's running, and it won't charge on one of the outlets in our house (everything else works fine on that outlet).\n\nGeek squad wants $149.99 for just a diagnostic or $179.99 for a one-year membership, but can't tell me if I would need to buy parts without doing the diagnostic. Given all of the issues, and the fact that I have had it almost 3 years, I started looking at laptops and have landed on this one (possibly):  \nLenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 2025 Copilot+ PC with Intel Core Ultra 7 256V Processor, 1TB SSD, Yoga Pen, 14” WUXGA OLED Dolby Vision® Touchscreen, 16GB LPDDR5x-8533 Memory, 5MP IR Cam, Wi-Fi 7, and Win11 Pro  \n[https://a.co/d/gamnGK4](https://a.co/d/gamnGK4)\n\nI was just about to order this one when I decided to read another Reddit thread on this very model from 10 months ago, and one person said it's not great for Zoom b/c the audio is horrible and the video quality is not good. Another person said it \"screams,\" meaning the fan is really loud.\n\nWell, I run three 2-hour Zoom meetings every week, plus additional 1 hour meetings depending on what I have going on. In addition, I mostly use my laptop to create basic canva designs for IG and FB posts, minimal video editing, basic Google drive/Gmail functions, Zoom meetings, Zapier, Thrivecart, etc. My current Asus has been perfect for my needs. Battery life is important.\n\nWould love some suggestions. Ideally, I would like to spend no more than $1,200. Some questions:  \n1. How important is OLED?\n\n2. Seems 16GB is sufficient for what I do or should I go with 32 GB?\n\n3. Processor recommendations?\n\nThank you,\n\nK",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI sat on my friend’s computer and SNAPPED it. Now the hinge looks like this. Computer still functions, but sometimes the screen falls all the way back. \n\nIt’s not in warranty, and repair shops are quoting her $400-$500 for the repair. Her computer is an HP ENVY x360 15.6 inch 2-in-1 Laptop PC 15-ew1000 (794COAV).\n\nShe’s going into law school so she was looking at getting a Microsoft Surface, but the model she was looking at has lower specs than her computer. She was hoping to trade this one in, but obviously she isn’t going to get much in trade-in value for a laptop with a broken hinge.\n\nI was wondering if there’s any way I can fix this myself or how difficult of a fix it would be. If anyone can give me advice, it would be greatly appreciated!",

Its very fast when opening tabs and apps but whenever i try to play games on it, they lag a lot, especially 3d games like Overwatch, Roblox. Meanwhile my pc, which has much lower specs runs both games on high settings. I tried every possible thing like changing the power settings, tweaking nvidia control pannel, changing some settings in my BIOS, etc... I even tried to mod my graphics card but when i did, all my games would crash. It did kind of increase my fps on some games that i managed to try.\n\nMy sister owns a HP Zbook aswell with the same specs as mine except 64GB RAM and her games run extremely smoothly on high settings.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** 2.500 euros\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** No, can't find much here where I live\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Same as a MacBook Pro M1 Pro - great construction quality, similar battery life when not doing work tasks (writing docs, light media, etc.). For gaming, I would only do it plugged.\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Same weight and thinness as a MacBook Pro M1 Pro. Do not need something paper thin, but don't want also a +6kg pc.\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 13-14'\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run**: Want to play games with it when plugged. Outside that - fast and smooth experience when doing media, work tasks like writing docs, light weight coding / vibe coding. Basically my current experience with my work MacBook Pro M1 Pro, but that can also game in Windows.\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 60Fps and at least 1080p is a must have. I'm using an Xbox Series X for more intensive games, but if I can play for example Oblivion Remastered well enough in 1080p 60fps with mods I'm more than happy. But it will be for indie/multiplayer pc exclusive games (mmorpgs, Mobas, etc...)\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Good keyboard is a must - something akin to what the MacBook Pro m1 offers. Not the best, but it is good enough for a solid experience. When gaming at home I will connect external screens (at least 2) and external keyboard. min 512gb ssd + 16/32 gb ram. If possible, 2k120hz screen, don't need 4k. reliable build quality for sure, after using this MacBook, I really care about a pc that won't explode by itself after a few years of use. At least +2 Usb C Ports, HDMI and a headphone jack\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** this is to be my daily driver - to work outside my main job and that can game whenever im missing something on xbox Series X or Switch.",

This night I was playing some games with my friends and I noticed a faint burning smell and it was driving me crazy cause no one else in my house could smell it but me (idk why) but then I checked my computer cord and unplugged it and the plug with the metal bit was burnt , the blue tip at the end was almost completely gone , the whole metal part was bent and had charring and what I think to be black plastic from the computer it self melting? And then the plastic part of the plug was white almost in the appearance of cooled down hot glue (idk why ) and I was really concerned. I then inspected the port itself and the port is also melted and warped a bit and on the inside it seems as if there is either some sort of fuzz or melted plastic or metal on the inside. I’m super bummed cause I’ve basically survived all of my teen years and young adult life with this and this is my only access to my current job and all of my games, digital art and music projects . Any help or guidance on what is happening and what I can or can’t do is greatly appreciated and sorry for any grammar mistakes I’m on phone and also stressed lol",

And I know 65 is not a high enough temp to worry about but this just bothers me why this is a thing)\n\nI know CPUs utilize more power when plugged in but here's the weird part\nthis doesn't happen for games that are obviously more demanding like Outlast they stay around 55°c when plugged in.\n\nAnd for a game like steamworld dig or undertale that barely requires the CPU to do something, going to the 60s is very confusing to me. What's really annoying is that when I first booted Steamworld dig today the temps hovered around 52°c which made sense but then on my second time running it the temps are now at 67°c (I remember the same thing happening with hollow knight).\n\nI like using my laptop plugged in a lot so usually I'll prefer to play plugged in too, so this gets very annoying when I can feel the CPU warming up under my hand for no reason.\n\nSo yeah this probably sounds like a ramblings of a madman but please, make it make sense 🥺.",

I find [Frame.work](http://Frame.work) relatively interesting, but they're already very expensive. And that's where it ends, it seems to me.\n\nI just don't want traditional brands like Asus, Acer, etc. I don't even want those things.\n\nAnd I can't imagine using a Chromebook in my everyday life. Although I really like the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, as an exception to the brand. But a Chromebook is absolutely unusable offline.",

    "selftext": "OK, here we go. I know I will get several opinions, but after doing tons of research, getting chatGPT's help, and reading one Reddit thread after another I am thoroughly confused. I currently have an Asus Zenbook Pro 15 Flib OLED. I've had it just 2 months shy of 3 years now and end of last month it started intermittently booting straight into UEFI (BIOS). The keyboard is also giving me problems (some keys not working unless I push down hard), I lose my screen for a few seconds when I plug it in while it's running, and it won't charge on one of the outlets in our house (everything else works fine on that outlet).\n\nGeek squad wants $149.99 for just a diagnostic or $179.99 for a one-year membership, but can't tell me if I would need to buy parts without doing the diagnostic. Given all of the issues, and the fact that I have had it almost 3 years, I started looking at laptops and have landed on this one (possibly):  \nLenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 2025 Copilot+ PC with Intel Core Ultra 7 256V Processor, 1TB SSD, Yoga Pen, 14” WUXGA OLED Dolby Vision® Touchscreen, 16GB LPDDR5x-8533 Memory, 5MP IR Cam, Wi-Fi 7, and Win11 Pro  \n[https://a.co/d/gamnGK4](https://a.co/d/gamnGK4)\n\nI was just about to order this one when I decided to read another Reddit thread on this very model from 10 months ago, and one person said it's not great for Zoom b/c the audio is horrible and the video quality is not good. Another person said it \"screams,\" meaning the fan is really loud.\n\nWell, I run three 2-hour Zoom meetings every week, plus additional 1 hour meetings depending on what I have going on. In addition, I mostly use my laptop to create basic canva designs for IG and FB posts, minimal video editing, basic Google drive/Gmail functions, Zoom meetings, Zapier, Thrivecart, etc. My current Asus has been perfect for my needs. Battery life is important.\n\nWould love some suggestions. Ideally, I would like to spend no more than $1,200. Some questions:  \n1. How important is OLED?\n\n2. Seems 16GB is sufficient for what I do or should I go with 32 GB?\n\n3. Processor recommendations?\n\nThank you,\n\nK",

I don't really know about PSUs at all but after searching a little bit I found a spreadsheet that was mentioning the XPG Core Reactor II and the Corsair RM850x as A+. I really wanted a PSU reliable since I am trusting all my other parts to it. Is there some better part or is there some bottleneck in this build?",

I turned it off to go do some stuff done and when I came back there was significant audio and visual stuttering and artifacts appearing on screen.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m having a strange issue with my PC setup and I’m hoping someone here can help me figure it out.\n\n**My specs:**\n\n* GPU: GTX 1650 4GB\n* CPU: Intel Core i7-4770K\n* RAM: 16 GB DDR3\n* Storage: SSD (games installed on it)\n* OS: Windows 10\n\nI’m getting **unexpectedly low FPS** and frequent stuttering in games like *Spider-Man Remastered* and *Cyberpunk 2077*, even when I drop the resolution to 720p. It feels like the GPU and CPU aren’t working well together — almost like there’s a hidden bottleneck or conflict.\n\nWhat’s weird is that when I had an **RX 470**, performance was noticeably better. Same system, same games, but smoother gameplay and higher FPS.\n\nI’ve already checked:\n\n* Temperatures (they’re fine)\n* PCIe is running at x16\n* Drivers are up to date\n* No background apps interfering\n* Game is installed on SSD\n\nI found avideoshowing a similar setup, and even there the FPS looks lower than expected. Someone in the comments said:\n\n>\n\nSo clearly, this setup **should** perform better. I’m wondering if it’s a driver issue, BIOS setting, or something deeper.\n\nAny ideas what could be causing this? Has anyone else run into similar problems with GTX 1650 + i7-4770K?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’ve posted this issue before but it’s recurring and I’m about to pull my hair out. This will be a bit of a long read but I feel the details are necessary. The TLDR is I keep getting driver timeout errors, sometimes one a day sometimes 10, on an otherwise perfectly working PC\n\nSpecs:\n\nRyzen 7 9800x3d with -20 undervolt (I have also tried removing this and problem persists)\n\nGigabyte aorus elite x870e mobo\n\n32gb cl32 trident z5 rgb ram @6000 (2 sticks)\n\nXfx mercury 9070xt gpu\n\nCorsair rm1000x PSU\n\nSamsung 970 pro 1tb (boot)\n\nSamsung 980 2tb (storage)\n\nWd black s550 1tb (storage)\n\n\nOn to the issue - About 8 months ago my motherboard died and bricked my pc. I took this time to upgrade to AM5. I ordered a 9800x3d, this mobo, this ram, this psu, and the wd black nvme. I also replaced fans and coolers but that’s likely irrelevant. The only part I carried over was my EVGA 3080 ftw 3 ultra which seemed fine. \n\nAfter building, I noticed I would have some crashes to desktop during gaming regardless of how intense the game was. No errors, just crashing. Pc has great temps and it was getting to the point it was frustrating me so logic led me to believe my 3080 was dying even though while playing its performance was great. I just assumed it was bad as it was my only carry over part and it survived 2 dead mobos. \n\nAfter endless frustration I bought a new 9070xt mentioned above and installed AFTER a full DDU. \n\nCard performs amazing, it’s cooling great, and definitely an improvement. After a few hours - black screen, crash to desktop, Adrenalin tells me a driver timeout occurred. This may happen 10x a day or once or not at all. This is my first AMD card so Adrenalin telling me this is new. I honestly don’t know how to fix it, I spent a lot of cash on this build and may of even replaced a gpu that was healthy for no reason. Anyone who has any advice would be my honorary best friend, I’ll now list what steps I’ve taken so far:\n\nFull DDU prior to gpu install \n\nFresh AMD driver install (even tried beta driver)\n\nLowering clock speeds -300 in Adrenalin as I’ve seen other users report this helps online due to adrenalin boost over max clock and HW info occasionally shows it peaking over 3100mhz (even after I put offset in)\n\nLowering ram speeds from 6000 to 5400 with Ryzen master\n\nFull windows fresh install and formatted all SSDs. This was a nightmare with multiple drives\n\nFull bios reset - almost bricked pc it wouldn’t recognize display devices but some reseating and cmos clearing helped\n\nWindows memory diagnostic tool reports no ram issues but I’m starting to think they may be the culprit\n\nReseating of gpu & ram\n\nSomeone please have the cure all - I’m about to lose my mind!",

(ran it more than 3 days and no black display).  \nBut after some time my 3090 fan wouldn't even spin, when I get it to the repair shop, they said it's burnt badly and it's almost impossible to repair it and it's not worth in even trying to get it repaired.\n\nSo I got myself a new GPU (5070TI) and new motherboard.\n\nNow the question is should I change my PSU or not, since it's claimed by Corsair that it's high end performance PSU but why it didn't save the motherboard which eventually took  down my 3090 along with it.\n\nand if I should change the PSU, should I buy Stabilizer or UPS along with it ?\n\nand no in my area the black outs rarely happen.\n\nThanks for any feedback and suggestion !",

Recently, AI video generation workloads have been hitting the limits of available system RAM use for data being copied to/from GPU VRAM, so I decided to look into moving up to 128GB.\n\nI picked up a 2x64GB kit at a good price on Amazon Warehouse deals.  It's DDR5-6400, but CL42, so I expect performance to be a bit lower. 2x64GB CL30 kits are not easy to find.  The AIDA64 memory benchmark reports a latency of 98ns for the DDR5-6400 CL42, vs 82ns for the DDR5-6000 CL30 kit.  \n\nI can't say that I notice a difference for any of may work though.  Gaming performance is just as good as far as I can tell, and the additional memory has sped up my AI workflows. From that perspective, I think I'll just keep the 128GB CL42, unless there is something else I am not considering here.",

    "selftext": "Hey redditors!\n\n  \nIf you're looking for someone's experience on bringing their PC to an international flight, mine might be heplful.\n\nI took my PC on a 3 hour flight with me, and was initially very scared. After watching many tutorials, I settled upon taking the GPU out and entirely filling the interior of the PC with clothes. I've seen people fill it with expandable foam, which is a better option but is way more expensive than just my clothes, that I'll be taking with me anyway. I then wrapped the PC in about 3-4 layers of bubble wrap to keep it from moving. As for the box, anything with enough cushioning should work fine. Use the original PC case box if you still have it, but pretty sure your PC will hardly fit in it anymore because of the bubble wrap, but that box was supposed to handle your empty case, not your built pc. My initial plan was a suitcase, but only go with that if its a hard-shell, but still give a lot of cushioning because the airport staff might reject to label it as \"FRAGILE\" and the airport handlers really don't care about our luggage. Finally, I bought a corrugated box that was pretty tough and in it, surrounded the pc from all 6 sides by foam/clothes. I was travelling with family so had no issue as for the amount of clothes, but you can buy normal foam as well, just make sure it wont start dropping pieces of it when moved around (happens with certain types of foam). I then taped the box as well as I could (almost spent an entire roll) and even sat on it to confirm its rigidity. As for the GPU, I took a rigid box I got with my headphones and after bubble wrapping the GPU, I put it in the box, surrounded by foam as well. I could not find static bag so had to use bubble wrap, but if you manage to find a static bag, often in the original packing of the GPU, use that before bubble wrapping. At the airport, the security officers thankfully did not suspect a thing and I passed security. Before getting the boarding pass and checking in the bag, I told them to label the bag as \"FRAGILE\" and they did so in front of me. But I'm not really sure how much that helped since the side the \"FRAGILE\" was written on is almost everytime not the one facing you. I'm pretty sure the handlers ignored it too. When I reached my home and opened the box, I could see everything in the same condition as I had left it, which was a huge relief. Then I opened the side glass, took out all my clothes, installed the GPU (which arrived in perfect condition too) and powered on the PC. \n\nAnd that's how I successfully brought my PC with me on a flight.",

I'm trying to build my next pc and wondering what gpu I should pair with the 9800x3d I was originally thinking about getting the 9060 xt and then looked at the 9070xt and was tempted I am wanting to spend that much more if the difference isn't drastic. I'm not opposed to getting an Nvidia gpu if the performance is far greater at the same price point. I want some insight on what I was planning on doing. Also was wanting to sell both my 240hz 1080p and 144 hz 1440p monitors and upgrading to a 4k 165-180 hz monitor with a dumb second monitor my Total budget for the pc is gonna be around 1500 trying to be budget friendly.

    "selftext": "I wanted to ask a question of the forum about changing from Intel to AMD.  I have been using AMD products till 2014, and went over to Intel because I use my PC mainly for work. Some graphic design and photo and video editing, which I needed a stronger setup. But now I'm not doing that kind of work anymore, I wanted to go back to AMD due to its value and not worrying about the constant upgrading that Intel does. Plus to save on my energy bill.  \n\nWhat would be a comparative AMD system that would be in the Intel i7 range?  I don't game, and don't do heavy video editing.\n\nPresently, I'm running an i9 14900K.  (I don't need that kind of horsepower anymore - but Micro Center had it on sale for just a bit over 450.00).  I have a Z790 mobo from Asus (Strix gaming) which is PCIe 5.0 with 64gb of 6400mhz DDR 5 ram CL32 (Corsair Vengeance)  I also have a 1000 watt power supply (Corsair shift - which helps a lot in my case.)  I have a nVidia Asus Strix 3070ti which I am looking to purchase a 5070ti soon.   \n\nI just wanted what would be a good AMD setup as far as a mobo and cpu that is comparable which is powerful, but efficient. I'm ready to go back to AMD and any ideas on specs would help me a lot since I'm not up on AMD like I should.",

    "selftext": "Hey redditors!\n\n  \nIf you're looking for someone's experience on bringing their PC to an international flight, mine might be heplful.\n\nI took my PC on a 3 hour flight with me, and was initially very scared. After watching many tutorials, I settled upon taking the GPU out and entirely filling the interior of the PC with clothes. I've seen people fill it with expandable foam, which is a better option but is way more expensive than just my clothes, that I'll be taking with me anyway. I then wrapped the PC in about 3-4 layers of bubble wrap to keep it from moving. As for the box, anything with enough cushioning should work fine. Use the original PC case box if you still have it, but pretty sure your PC will hardly fit in it anymore because of the bubble wrap, but that box was supposed to handle your empty case, not your built pc. My initial plan was a suitcase, but only go with that if its a hard-shell, but still give a lot of cushioning because the airport staff might reject to label it as \"FRAGILE\" and the airport handlers really don't care about our luggage. Finally, I bought a corrugated box that was pretty tough and in it, surrounded the pc from all 6 sides by foam/clothes. I was travelling with family so had no issue as for the amount of clothes, but you can buy normal foam as well, just make sure it wont start dropping pieces of it when moved around (happens with certain types of foam). I then taped the box as well as I could (almost spent an entire roll) and even sat on it to confirm its rigidity. As for the GPU, I took a rigid box I got with my headphones and after bubble wrapping the GPU, I put it in the box, surrounded by foam as well. I could not find static bag so had to use bubble wrap, but if you manage to find a static bag, often in the original packing of the GPU, use that before bubble wrapping. At the airport, the security officers thankfully did not suspect a thing and I passed security. Before getting the boarding pass and checking in the bag, I told them to label the bag as \"FRAGILE\" and they did so in front of me. But I'm not really sure how much that helped since the side the \"FRAGILE\" was written on is almost everytime not the one facing you. I'm pretty sure the handlers ignored it too. When I reached my home and opened the box, I could see everything in the same condition as I had left it, which was a huge relief. Then I opened the side glass, took out all my clothes, installed the GPU (which arrived in perfect condition too) and powered on the PC. \n\nAnd that's how I successfully brought my PC with me on a flight.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "**Greetings, everyone!**\n\nOur upcoming project - a medieval RPG **Legacy of Valor** \\- is on Kickstarter, and we've already surpassed our first stretch goal.\n\nBut first, I'd like to introduce you to the game itself.\n\n**Legacy of Valor** is a medieval RPG that blends **castle building**, **territory management**, **large-scale battles**, and a **story-driven narrative** into one immersive experience. In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Husák! 😊), but soon, **thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his **passion, enthusiasm, and desire** are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Husák himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to **expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile – and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point, **we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that **Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*“Hey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors — If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you’re gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step — launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign — just like old times — and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let’s rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let’s build that castle from the ground up — together.”*\n\nWe can’t express how much this means to us. **Warhorse Studios inspired us** \\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives **Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let’s carry this legacy forward. **Together!**\n\nKickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit: [r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX: [https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website: [https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

    "selftext": "I purchased Ryse: Son of Rome on August 29th. This was the first time I ever purchased from Humble Bundle. At the time and to this day, I have not seen a banner on Humble's store indicating they are out of keys for Ryse: Son of Rome. I am using Chrome and not running any ad blocker, so I suspect this is not an issue with my personal browser. These banners are referenced in Humble's FAQ on key exhaustion. I have exchanged 3 messages with humble support inquiring about the lack of a banner and if the 60-day refund window applies if I have not received a key. Not only did they take on average 7 days to respond they also talked around my questions and provided no real support. I am willing to give a great deal of leeway, after all, this is for charity. That said, the dishonesty or ineptitude of the support team and the implication that Humble can keep my money and provide me with nothing in return just leaves me with a gross feeling that I can't shake. I will never use this storefront again. I have only ever heard good things about Humble. Am I just phenomenally unlucky, or is this a common experience no one talks about?",

Somewhere.\n\nThe biggest twist, is that the battles are fewer, but longer, with new enemies spawning, dropping loot, and allowing you to craft DURING combat.\n\nIt's a bit like an OVA anime from a larger universe.\n\nWe launched in April, but the game is on sale now, and we added a real nice update during the Autumn sale, so I thought I'd give it a try and tell you about the game.\n\nDesign-wise, I tried to focus on having fewer, but more tactically worthwhile spells, and enemies that are mechanically interesting.\n\nSince launch we've put out a few free updates, and hope to make more. Of note is the extra difficult secret level in the final world. We're very attentive to feedback, and the last update was about helping players deal with how they experienced randomness.\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, both the good and the bad stuff.",

    "selftext": "Just now I was playing mafia 2. I am 9 hours into the game and I started the game with hard difficulty like I have started to do with all of my games recently. I have come at a level that is simply impossible to cross, not because of any skill issue but simply because this game has a bad 'Hard' difficulty mode.\n\nThere are games where hard difficulty simply means a basic buff to all enemies. They function like normal npc's but their damaged is increased, they spot you unreasonably fast, and even their pistols shoot kilometers (miles) away and it takes a takes a whole mag to kill one enemy. Your gameplay does not change. You still take cover and shoot, you simply stay in cover for longer, and have to shoot the same enemy twice as much, but its the same.\n\nIn this particular mission in mafia, the enemies are just unfair. Rather than enemies coordinating better, they and their guns have simply been buffed. And I am not lying when I say this, I cannot shoot a Thompson at my target after a certain distance because of insane recoil, my enemies, with that same Thompson, are killing me with 2 bullets from twice that distance. Molotov cocktails fall in front of my cover but I still get damage, and the most baffling part is that I get some damage even behind covers.\n\nThis is a bad hard mode, although understandable because the game came out in 2010. In such a mode, you can overcome with skill only to be lead to such an instance where skill can not overcome the bad design. Like how my enemy keeps throwing molotovs every 5 seconds in a small space filled with constantly spawning enemies, I peak and someone shoots me, I play smart and get killed by a Molotov that isint even near me.\n\nI am also playing wolfenstein currently and it has a much better hard mode. Its actually challenging but most of all, its reasonably challenging, you can improve and get better or retry until you finally clear a level. Enemy damage does increase but they don't turn into bullet sponges, enemies coordinate better and have better reflexes rather than being one shot kill. In Wolfenstein you just have to plan better, remember the med kits and the Armour and use them strategically. But mafia 2 doesnt offer me any such option, the gameplay is yet the same regardless of difficulty.",

The game has about 12 hours of content from what I've seen.\n\n  \nAnd down the line if you wanna replay it you can probably buy it for much lower price on sale anyway. Just don't get paying 80 € for game. \n\nFYI: for some reason some companies are pricing games at 70 $/80 €, while others are doing 70 $/70 €. ",

We initially made this as a sequel to Liminascent, our previous first-person platformer, and renamed it because here in France \"Liminascent\" isn't easy to pronounce...\n\nWell, we had a ton of fun making the game as a side project (besides our boring main jobs), and we are excited to see people playing the demo. It's our first solo project on Steam, as we already released a game with a publisher, but now we want more freedom, hence the self-publishing. We'd be more than happy to get feedback on the game, see what you like, what you dislike so we can enhance it and hopefully make something great in the long run! We're aiming for a release by the end of the year, as most of the \"complete\" game is ready.\n\nThe demo here is just a part of the complete game, to get the feeling of it and see if it's for you. We will probably keep the demo up permanently, as we believe it's better to be able to try a game before buying it.\n\nThat's it! Hope you'll enjoy it. I'll be available to answer any questions you might have.\n\nHere is the link of the game if you want to play!  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA\\_VERTIGO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA_VERTIGO)",

    "selftext": "**Hey, r/pcgaming!**\n\n**I’m Louis Denizet, game director at** [Hibernian Workshop](https://hibernian-workshop.com/)**, the indie studio behind the roguelite** [Astral Ascent](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280930/Astral_Ascent/) **— and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have!**\n\nI started the studio years ago after meeting Alexandre Magnat online — we were both self-taught and completely obsessed with pixel art, especially the kind you see in anime across different eras and styles. \n\nWhat followed after a few years since this match was Astral Ascent, a colorful, fast-paced roguelite in the vein of Dead Cells with a focus on fluid combat, replayability (with 5 unique characters to choose from), and wrapped up in a pixel art style that’s by now become a signature of our work. \n\nIt wasn’t our first game, but it’s the one where we finally found our footing. A bright fantasy with an underlying melancholy is how I’d describe the thematic heart of AA and we’ve been incredibly happy to see how many people resonated with it.\n\n**It’s also no lie to say that Astral Ascent was the biggest step forward for us as developers in general, and we’re still incredibly thankful for the community support we received.**\n\nWe’ve also recently launched our next project, [Fallen Fates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276270/Fallen_Fates/), this time a fantasy RPG (instead of a roguelite) built in collaboration with our community through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernian-workshop/fallen-fates). We’ve learned a lot from our past games — Astral Ascent most of all — and want to take everything we love about them and carry it over into this new, even more ambitious project… which, truth be told, probably won’t be done before 2028 (tentatively speaking) just because of the sheer scope of the project.\n\nIn any case, that’s the short of it about us.\n\nIt’s been a long road since we first started making games together, and each one has changed the way we think about what we do. Astral Ascent especially left a mark on us, not just in how we design but in how we see the people playing our work. It reminds us why we do this in the first place, and that’s to make beautiful games people will take joy in playing.\n\n**We’re excited to chat with you all and answer any questions whatsoever!**   \n\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you all! :)",

I'm posting today because our team is absolutely floored by the community response during the Steam Next Fest, and we wanted to share this incredible milestone with you all.\n\nAs of this morning, our game, **Re:Night**, has climbed to the **#1 Top Demo spot** in the official \"Card Game\" category for the festival.\n\n**You can see the proof here:** [https://imgur.com/a/gPUM0jI](https://imgur.com/a/gPUM0jI)\n\nFor our tiny indie team, this is a legitimate dream come true.\n\nFor those seeing **Re:Night** for the first time, it's our passion project—a deep, single-player fusion of **roguelike deckbuilding** (think *Slay the Spire*) and **grid-based SRPG tactics** (think *Into the Breach*). It's all about commanding a 3-person squad, where positioning on the board is just as critical as the cards you play.\n\nThe full game is planned for Q4 2025, but the free demo that's currently topping the charts is available for everyone to play right now. We would be genuinely honored to get feedback from one of the most dedicated PC gaming communities on the internet.\n\nI'll be here all day to answer any questions you might have about the game, the development process, or this crazy Next Fest experience.\n\n**Key Links:**\n\n* **Play the Free Demo on Steam:** [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2372240/ReNight/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2372240/ReNight/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=pcgaming_number1_milestone)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8pdmfp9ubivf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c3e3a5c809aa34a4ea14114100c0ce00e841569",

    "selftext": "Announcement Post \n\nA dark comedy point-and-click murder mystery set in 1997 where every pixel is evidence, every action costs time, and every ending is twisted.\n\nIt’s 1997 in the small, suspicious town of Ravenvale Heights. A string of mysterious student deaths has the whole community on edge… and you, a weary, grizzled ex-detective, have been sent undercover as a “safety auditor” to figure out what’s really going on.\n\nSideEye High is a darkly comedic, mature-themed point-and-click adventure that combines the style of ‘90s classics with modern investigation mechanics. Inspect every hallway, locker, and gum-stained tile—because in this school, everything is evidence.\n\nFeatures:\n\nOne Main Mystery, Dozens of Detours – Solve the core case, or get sidetracked by over 50 false endings, each with its own twisted mini-mystery.\n\nNo Fail States – The week-long investigation ends no matter what, but your choices—and missed clues—shape the outcome.\n\nZoom Beyond the Surface – Get close enough to read notes, see tiny details, or even peek behind objects.\n\nEvery Pixel Matters – Nearly everything is searchable and interactable, down to screws in the wall and scuff marks on the floor.\n\nTime is Your Enemy – Every action costs time. Decide what’s worth investigating before the clock runs out.\n\nMature Dark Humor – 1990s satire that’s sharp, absurd, and occasionally uncomfortably real.\n\nSideEye High is for those who grew up loving adventure games and are ready for one that grew up with them.\n\nNew Demo now available!",

    "selftext": "Windows is very close to being great for gamepads. There are multiple third-party apps (like r/Playnite) that allow for a great gamepad experience in multiple aspects, however, typing is NOT one of them.\n\nA lot of games require typing, which prevents us from having a true couch gaming experience on PC, but there's an easy solution that only Microsoft can provide:\n\n**1 - Allow us to open the new on-screen keyboard (OSK), with gamepad support, that at the moment is reserved for tablets, by clicking or pressing A over text boxes, and through a gamepad button combo.**   \nThis would allow the OSK to be invoked by either simulating a mouse click with the gamepad (for older games), selecting text boxes with A (on modern games that eventually support this feature), or force-opening it with a gamepad combo for games that are particularly iffy with text boxes. This would effectively bypass the need to get out of the sofa and use a keyboard just to name your character in a new RPG, for example. \n\n**2 - Make sure the OSK, on gamepad mode, captures all gamepad inputs for itself, and does not allow these inputs to reach the game in the background.**  \nThis would prevent a big problem with the already existing Steam keyboard: if you're not playing the game with SteamInput enabled (for example, in games that already support Xbox gamepads), all the gamepad buttons being pressed while typing are also reaching the game, causing your character to walk, attack or do whatever actions correspond to the typing shortcuts, including leaving the text box in case of emulators. Capturing all inputs from the gamepad and only sending what is actually being typed (the keyboard keys) would prevent this, and massively increase compatibility with older games.\n\n**Bonus:** give us the fullscreen Windows experience for desktops, and allow it to use custom library managers (like Playnite). This would fix a lot of problems with window focus that can happen when launching games in borderless fullscreen and also make the experience more seamless. \n\nI believe these tweaks would greatly improve the gaming experience on Windows, bringing it much closer to an authentic Xbox experience.",

Each one has unique traits and drops items that can be used to craft decorations, furniture, and lures. Sometimes they get attacked by Ghosts who just want to spoil the fun.\n\nThe demo covers the first seven in-game days (around 1.5-2 hours of play). You can:\n\n* Attract and care for your first Critterlings\n* Decorate your farm and house with dozens of craftable items\n* Experiment with items that lure specific species\n* Meet the Townfolk and explore the beach\n\nIt’s colorful, weird, and hopefully very cozy.\n\n👉 **Play the demo here:** [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2497070/Cosmic\\_Coop/]()\n\nI’ll be hanging out in the comments to answer any questions about development, inspiration, or the design process.\n\nThanks for checking it out and for supporting small devs during Next Fest!",

Players will have unprecedented terraforming control, and will be able to \"own\" planets and interact in a galactic economy.\n\nKoster gives more details on the system in this longform chat, such as the limitations they had to place on moving fire and water, the methods of creation and sustainability they implemented to counteract the methods of destruction, and how different species of plants and animals evolve.\n\nIn developer circles he's also well known for writing A Theory of Fun, and there's a large section of the chat devoted to game design theory. At the time the book was written, \"are games art?\" was a hot topic, and 20 years later he's happy to revisit that and recount how gaming has progressed.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "**Greetings, everyone!**\n\nOur upcoming project - a medieval RPG **Legacy of Valor** \\- is on Kickstarter, and we've already surpassed our first stretch goal.\n\nBut first, I'd like to introduce you to the game itself.\n\n**Legacy of Valor** is a medieval RPG that blends **castle building**, **territory management**, **large-scale battles**, and a **story-driven narrative** into one immersive experience. In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Husák! 😊), but soon, **thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his **passion, enthusiasm, and desire** are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Husák himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to **expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile – and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point, **we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that **Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*“Hey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors — If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you’re gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step — launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign — just like old times — and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let’s rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let’s build that castle from the ground up — together.”*\n\nWe can’t express how much this means to us. **Warhorse Studios inspired us** \\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives **Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let’s carry this legacy forward. **Together!**\n\nKickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit: [r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX: [https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website: [https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

    "selftext": "**Hey, r/pcgaming!**\n\n**I’m Louis Denizet, game director at** [Hibernian Workshop](https://hibernian-workshop.com/)**, the indie studio behind the roguelite** [Astral Ascent](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280930/Astral_Ascent/) **— and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have!**\n\nI started the studio years ago after meeting Alexandre Magnat online — we were both self-taught and completely obsessed with pixel art, especially the kind you see in anime across different eras and styles. \n\nWhat followed after a few years since this match was Astral Ascent, a colorful, fast-paced roguelite in the vein of Dead Cells with a focus on fluid combat, replayability (with 5 unique characters to choose from), and wrapped up in a pixel art style that’s by now become a signature of our work. \n\nIt wasn’t our first game, but it’s the one where we finally found our footing. A bright fantasy with an underlying melancholy is how I’d describe the thematic heart of AA and we’ve been incredibly happy to see how many people resonated with it.\n\n**It’s also no lie to say that Astral Ascent was the biggest step forward for us as developers in general, and we’re still incredibly thankful for the community support we received.**\n\nWe’ve also recently launched our next project, [Fallen Fates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276270/Fallen_Fates/), this time a fantasy RPG (instead of a roguelite) built in collaboration with our community through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernian-workshop/fallen-fates). We’ve learned a lot from our past games — Astral Ascent most of all — and want to take everything we love about them and carry it over into this new, even more ambitious project… which, truth be told, probably won’t be done before 2028 (tentatively speaking) just because of the sheer scope of the project.\n\nIn any case, that’s the short of it about us.\n\nIt’s been a long road since we first started making games together, and each one has changed the way we think about what we do. Astral Ascent especially left a mark on us, not just in how we design but in how we see the people playing our work. It reminds us why we do this in the first place, and that’s to make beautiful games people will take joy in playing.\n\n**We’re excited to chat with you all and answer any questions whatsoever!**   \n\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you all! :)",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

So i wanted to add some intake fans an had to tear it apart to plug them in because the aio blocks the whole top of the mb in the montech xr. Decided im going to pull off the cooler check to make sure everything is right an repaste an see if i get better temps. Its only a 9600x. Full out pbo and a optimized negative curve it will go to about 85-88c on cinebench idles around 44c. With the air cooler it would go up to low 90s. Idk if this is normal or not. But when i pulled the pump head off there was a shiny substance on maybe 3 corners of the cpu. Not big but on one of the corners it looks like it left a mark on the cooler too. I couldnt find a leak on the aio anywhere an where the liquid was it would of had to seep through the metal plate which i dont see happening. So i put it back on an pulled it off again the next day. It looked like it was starting to happen again on one of the corners really small. Can thermal paste get like that? I feel like if it was a liquid it wouldnt of stayed right there. Any ideas whats going on? Should i rid the aio? Lol got me worried now.",

After that, I slowly started falling in love with the universe of Half-Life & Portal. I remember being scared by those games, and I had to play them behind my brother’s back so he wouldn’t find out. \\^\\^\n\nThese days, I work in the game dev industry as a freelancer, but in the evenings I always try to find time to work on little projects of my own.\n\nThe game I’ve been trying to finish and release for the past \\~2 years is called SECTOR ZERO. It’s a physics-based, dark sci-fi puzzle adventure where you play as a fragment of an ancient hive-mind entity that lies dormant in the core of a huge asteroid, but it gets awakened by human mining operations.I'm trying to capture a bit of that Half-Life and Portal magic I grew up with.\n\nThere’s also a \\~25-minute demo you can check out if you’d like to get a feel for how the game plays.  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352050/SECTOR\\_ZERO/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352050/SECTOR_ZERO/)  \nIf this looks like something you would enjoy you can support the game by wishlisting it on Steam!\n\nIf you have any feedback or questions, let me know! \\^\\^",

    "selftext": "EDIT:  PSA: Don't use the \"Octopus\" adapter\n\n\n\nWe have all seen the latest posts. Doesn't matter what MSI 5090 you have....\n\nJust don't. For whatever reason this adapter is not suited to the continuous power draw that the 5090 requires...pictures 1-2. You can use it, but do so at your own risk. I have the MSI 5090 OC edition pictured.\n\nInstead, make sure your PSU is at least 3.0 compliant, minimum 1000watts and comes with its own 12vhpwhr cable. Pictures 4 and 5. If you try to run your new $2500-$3000+ GPU on a PSU that is ATX 2.5 and older you are doing so at your own risk.\n\nIf your PSU is 3.0 ATX compliant but it DID NOT come with a 12vhpwr cable for some reason you should be able to order one from your PSU manufacturer: I bought a sleeved type 4 cable from Corsair - Make sure your PSU and the ordered cable are compatible.\n\nIf you take all of these precautions to protect your PC you should be fine. I stress \"should.\" If you overclock your 5090 heavily, or don't plug in the cables securely, that is the risk you are taking. I have even overclocked my MSI 5090 a bit more and it was pulling 615 watts at times (undervolted now because 615watts is crazy to see!) No issue with cable melting using the Corsair type 4 cable that came with my PSU. Again don't use the included GPU adapter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4sdyd56hp3wf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c6d282c424af35ebe299b01a8482545a51cca01\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wfxri65ip3wf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=216888a3005cf83856187e744fb311b91964b633\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5095gfnjp3wf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a6aa94ea3a06d16bca9c14972be88d62fab403d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/125q7g2lp3wf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2630bf21f6faa2af7a93b916489d91bb49ec428c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8njh0fxlp3wf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12eb72edef28bb35a770eafd4764b83d64398cff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzrzzv6np3wf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6544b9d482212f800d124f5a6c081d29010e673",

Powered off the PC and unplugged the PSU completely.\n\n\n2. Removed the old PCIe cables connected to the GPU.\n\n\n3. Replaced them with brand-new cables (came as spares with my PSU).\n\n\n4. Plugged each cable into a separate PSU port (no daisy-chaining).\n\n\n5. Reconnected everything and powered up.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nResult\n\nAfter replacing the GPU power cables, the issue is completely gone.\nNo more random shutdowns — system has been stable ever since.\n\n\n---\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf your PC shuts off suddenly with no BSOD or error:\nTry replacing your GPU power cables before swapping expensive parts.\nA loose or faulty PCIe cable can cause instant shutdowns.\n",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone! I've been wondering for a while whether 1080p is still relevant in 2025.   \nA quick clarification: I currently have a Full HD monitor and an AMD graphics card (so DLSS is simply unavailable to me), and I've come to the conclusion that using upscalers like FSR or Intel XeSS isn't a good idea, as the temporal algorithms won't have enough data to reconstruct the image with sufficient detail. But even in native rendering, I've started to notice (especially in games on UE 5) that shadows have become grainier, hair is pixelated, and many object edges are too blurry, as almost all of UE 5 uses temporal-based features (like Lumen). Which brings me to the question: is Full HD gaming still relevant in 2025? Which image will look better, native 1080p or upscaled 1440p? And the main question: will the image differ if I set the resolution to 4K on a 1080p monitor (using AMD Super Resolution or its NVIDIA equivalent) and play at 4K using the upscaler in performance mode (then the original render quality will be exactly 1080p)? Will the image differ from the native Full HD render?",

The prices here in Ecuador are insane so I gave him my gpu because I was planning to travel to US anyway and thought I could buy there a new gpu. Comes September and I saved enough to get a rtx5070 but as life happens my daughter needed it more so now I'm stuck with my good old (10years) evga 980ti. I love this card it carried me through very hard times since I bought it on the release night back in 2015. Meanwhile I have a 1440p and the card can't handle Battlefield 6 well on 1440p so now finally my question, is there a possibility to play in 1080p without it getting so blurry on my 1440p monitor? I tried the game in 1080p and it runs well with around 60-70fps with mid settings but it's so blurry that I can't see anything. I tried fsr and the Intel upscale but it just takes so much from the gpu that the performance is still very bad!(lower 30 fps). Is there something I'm not thinking about or any way to \"fit\" a 1080p picture into a 1440p monitor? I'm currently saving for a new gpu but until then I would like to maybe find a \"playable\" solution with my 980ti. Anything I can do? ",

This looks incredibly inefficient for me.\n\nI understand having specialist distros for server, or gaming is a good thing, but within a similar topic, -lets say gaming, has got nobara,bazite, steam os, catchos etc - devs instead of working together and make a good progress, they all just make their own distro, not doing real progress at all.",

I have a NVMe drive already in and I'm looking to get a second one, but for that I need an extension or an adapter. So if I buy one, do I put it in PCIe slot? I know that it will work slower since the slots that I have free are PCIe 2.0, and I kinda understand how the PCIe lanes work and from what I understood, x16 are for GPU, x4 are provided by the CPU to connect to the MOBO, and x4 are for the M.2 slot. So from my understanding, if it's possible to put such adapter to a PCIe slot, and have the first drive in the M.2 slot, both will work slower?

I love the case so far but my only complaint is it seems to be quite loud even when idle (the 2  170m intake fans are the reason I chose this case) I normally get 40-45 when idle or watching YouTube, with the temps jumping to the 50-60 with 50-60% cpu load, and around 70-80 when under full load like compiling shaders. I’ve never done fan curves before so I’d like to ask if anyone has anywhere to start? This case has pretty good airflow all around, and I have a 360 AIO\n\nThanks guys!",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nAfter months of random BSODs, NVMe drive crashes and sporadic HDMI/DisplayPort video dropouts and image flickering, I tracked the root cause to a **low and unstable 3.3v rail voltage**. Here’s how it went down and what fixed it:\n\n* I was using a Samsung 980 Pro NVMe SSD that frequently BSOD or disappeared under load (especially during GPU-heavy gaming). In the last couple of weeks I wasn't even able to boot the system from it and sometimes not even the BIOS detected it.\n* Tried different Windows versions, BIOS and other PCIe Gen modes (3/2/1) but nothing worked.\n* Tried a different Samsung 980 Pro NVME and still had the same issues.\n* **Tried a WD NVME and the BSODs stopped**.\n* **HWiNFO showed the motherboard's 3.3v rail dipping as low as 2.90v during load.**\n* I measured the PSU’s SATA 3.3v rail directly with a multimeter and it showed a healthy 3.28v. Since my PSU was new and I had the same issues with the previous PSU, I knew the PSU could not be the problem. So I suspected it could be the motherboard but...\n* I've been using [this 24-pin cable extension](https://i.imgur.com/DW5uabr.png) for years and I thought that maybe it went bad. After removing it, voltage readings stabilised at a clean 3.3v even while stress testing the NVME. I was able to boot from the Samsung NVME and it's been rock solid so far. Also, the video flickering/disconnects stopped because the 3.3v rail handles handshaking and data negotiation.\n\nSo, the main takeaway is this: **if you start having instability issues with your system, the first step should be to remove all cable extensions**. It might safe you months of troubleshooting 😅",

You have a unique ability to corrupt and possess human-made machinery. This clip is a small part of the final boss encounter.\n\nGames by Valve got me into game dev, so I'm really happy that I'm getting close to finishing a project of my own, which is inspired by the classics.\n\nBack in 2007, when I was about 12 years old, I discovered Valve Hammer Editor and started making my own maps for CS 1.6, which I then played over LAN with my brother and cousin. After that, I slowly started falling in love with the universe of Half-Life & Portal. I remember being scared by those games, and I had to play them behind my brother’s back so he wouldn’t find out. \\^\\^\n\nThese days, I work in the game dev industry as a freelancer, but in the evenings I always try to find time to work on little projects of my own.\n\nThe game I’ve been trying to finish and release for the past \\~2 years is called SECTOR ZERO. It’s a physics-based, dark sci-fi puzzle adventure where you play as a fragment of an ancient hive-mind entity that lies dormant in the core of a huge asteroid, but it gets awakened by human mining operations.I'm trying to capture a bit of that Half-Life and Portal magic I grew up with.\n\nThere’s also a \\~25-minute demo you can check out if you’d like to get a feel for how the game plays.  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352050/SECTOR\\_ZERO/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352050/SECTOR_ZERO/)  \nIf this looks like something you would enjoy you can support the game by wishlisting it on Steam!\n\nIf you have any feedback or questions, let me know! \\^\\^",

You have a unique ability to corrupt and possess human-made machinery. This clip is a small part of the final boss encounter.\n\nGames by Valve got me into game dev, so I'm really happy that I'm getting close to finishing a project of my own, which is inspired by the classics.\n\nBack in 2007, when I was about 12 years old, I discovered Valve Hammer Editor and started making my own maps for CS 1.6, which I then played over LAN with my brother and cousin. After that, I slowly started falling in love with the universe of Half-Life & Portal. I remember being scared by those games, and I had to play them behind my brother’s back so he wouldn’t find out. \\^\\^\n\nThese days, I work in the game dev industry as a freelancer, but in the evenings I always try to find time to work on little projects of my own.\n\nThe game I’ve been trying to finish and release for the past \\~2 years is called SECTOR ZERO. It’s a physics-based, dark sci-fi puzzle adventure where you play as a fragment of an ancient hive-mind entity that lies dormant in the core of a huge asteroid, but it gets awakened by human mining operations.I'm trying to capture a bit of that Half-Life and Portal magic I grew up with.\n\nThere’s also a \\~25-minute demo you can check out if you’d like to get a feel for how the game plays.  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352050/SECTOR\\_ZERO/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352050/SECTOR_ZERO/)  \nIf this looks like something you would enjoy you can support the game by wishlisting it on Steam!\n\nIf you have any feedback or questions, let me know! \\^\\^",

My solution was using a server rack cable management module that’s aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you’d do!",

I’ve been using them like this for about 6 months now and would love some ideas on how to make the setup more user friendly. \n\nI’m considering ditching the Studio Display entirely, but would like to explore other ideas before I go down that route.",

    "selftext": "**Please ignore the cables and mess, that is currently in progress to be fixed.**  \n  \nI’m trying to add a 4th display under my main monitor. All three of my current monitors are wall-mounted, so there’s about an 8.5-inch vertical gap between the desk and the bottom edge of the middle screen. I’d like to fill that space with a small monitor that can tilt upward toward me, something around 15 inches smaller or larger is fine if it fits nicely.\n\nI work two remote jobs. My main desktop runs my primary job, and my company laptop handles a second, lighter role where I mostly respond to messages and manage a small team. Both setups really benefit from having two screens. I plan to use a KVM switch to share my keyboard/mouse and possibly one or two monitors between the systems, but I’d like a dedicated screen underneath the middle monitor for quick multitasking.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Fits within an 8.5-inch gap under my center monitor\n* Can tilt upward (20–35° ideally)\n* Doesn’t need to be fancy — 1080p is fine\n* Ideally plug-and-play (HDMI or USB-C)\n* Clean look that blends well with my setup\n\nI’ve looked into stretch bar displays, which would look amazing, but most are expensive or complicated to set up. So I’m leaning toward a portable monitor as a practical option for now. I just want to see if anyone has found a budget-friendly tilted display that fits under a main monitor like this.",

I’d also love a setup that gives me enough space to write on paper without needing to move my keyboard out of the way. For reference, I am 6ft1 and my floor to hip distance is about 40in, so i assumed a 45” depth desk would satisfy this. I just cannot seem to find one .\n\nAn L-shaped desk seems ideal,as it would give me the flexibility and space I’m after. I do have a rather large 45” monitor, but I plan to mount it on a wall arm, so that should help with space management.\n\nI’m not opposed to building a desk myself, but I’d prefer to find something ready-made if possible.

Company I work with is mandating contractors have Windows 11 and my 6 year old desktop isn’t able to update to it. \n\nMy main problem is most the compatible desktops don’t have two display ports and a vga hookup (monitors don’t support hdmi). It’s been a while since I’ve bought monitors and a new computer so not even sure what I should be looking for now. \n\nAny recommendations here? Do I need a docking station or should I just try and find something that is compatible with the 2 display ports and a vga hookup+ Windows 11? \n\nTia ",

I was able to make the MagSafe mount for $8 and the monitor riser I made myself by using the same dimensions from various manufacturers. \n\nRocking a 34” LG ultra-wide and man I love it. Have basic Logitech pebble key 2 and a Logitech M550.\n\nI’ve got only one cable coming to the Mac which is my HP dock located under my desk (wish I could post more pictures)\n\nGot my DJ mixer up top as I love DJing but since I’m full time school I’ve really been off that and focused on school. Really like my setup I’ve only got one cable coming down which is my power cable and cable management is really clean. This also took me a bit as I was trying to figure out the best solution. My solution was using a server rack cable management module that’s aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you’d do!",

    "selftext": "My experiences:\n\n**Corsair K95 (gone)**\n\nThe prints on that are laser imprinted and quickly faded. it became glossy and looked dirty after some use. It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper. \n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I just about had it after about 10 keys with the problem. I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone but I am just about fed up with reliability issues and GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust that 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at odd locaiton. What other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI have posted this to Geek Hack also, but it's been over a week and my post has not been approved. I messaged the moderator of the Geek Hack interest checked forums, and they have not replied yet. So I thought I would make this post here also.\n\nI've got the prototype complete. If you guys have any suggestions of where I should sell this or if anyone would like to partner with me, please let me know.\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**ANSI60**\n\nA 4mm keyboard plate with multiple layout support.\n\n**Supported Layouts**\n\n* Split Backspace\n* Split Right Shift\n* Stepped Caps Lock\n* 7u Spacebar\n\n[Supported Layouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YHOHfZDZJXJPjWIfWgxHSUXzf9Ksx9y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Aluminum\n* Polycarbonate (PC)\n\n**Compatibility**\n\n* **Mounting styles:** Tray Mount\n* **Form factor:** 60% ANSI\n\n**Supported PCBs**\n\n* Venom HE 60% PCB\n* GH60 and DZ60 variants\n* Wooting 60HE\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**Introduction / Vision**\n\nIntroducing the **ANSI60** — a 4mm keyboard plate crafted for enthusiasts seeking to push the boundaries of typing acoustics and feel.   \nAt nearly three times the thickness of a standard 1.5mm plate, the ANSI60 transforms vibrational behavior, producing a crisper, more rounded tone with a fuller frequency response across the sound spectrum.\n\nMore than just thicker — the ANSI60 delivers a distinct typing experience unlike standard 1.5mm plates. With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested.

    "selftext": "First and foremost - I'm a tactile switch lover through and through. I've tried a fair number this year, the most recent being the Sillyworks x Gateron Type R. I've tried both more budget options (I see you Akko V3 Cream Blue Pro!) and more premium offerings like the Drop x Invyr Holy Pandas. I've spent too much money but honestly I no longer care because I may have found IT. The one. Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

Not usually a place to go for cheap vintage things as they generally know what's good and price accordingly.  For instance this was right next to a Model M keyboard for $150 which I felt was a little over priced.  Now obviously this will take some work to make it usable.  There are broken rivets so it will need a bolt mod in addition to building a case of some sorts and something to connect to the membrane cables to wire up to a controller.  But the keycaps are very cool and split a spacebar... heck yeah.  For now, it'll sit in the collection as I have a long list of projects to work on.  But someday, this thing will rock again.",

    "selftext": "I have built/modded several premium boards, but regardless of that fact,  I picked up a used Ducky One Mini. I had seen a video by Alex Otos, praising his 60% Ducky budget keyboard. He said it was his go-to for gaming. Therefore I decided to pick one up and guess what? I love it. I can’t really explain it, but it just feels good to type on. It has a quiet sound profile (which I typically hate), and has a pretty minimalist vibe to it.\n\nWhen I first bought it (used off of eBay), I immediately regretted it because I felt I overpaid for it after I foolishly looked around and found some for half the price. As soon as I got it, I tried to swap out keycaps and those freakin’ inductive switches came out with every single keycap! I soon realized the used budget keycap set I had grabbed (off of eBay, as well) were way too tight. I had to fight every single switch to get it out of the keycap I had pulled off (when I decided I didn’t like them and chose to go back to the original keycaps). They were so hard to detach from the keycaps, my hands were killing me. I finally resorted to a rubber jar gripper that made the job a little easier as I got down to the last few keycaps.\n\nThe inductive switches came out crazy easy and I was not happy about that. However, when I got it back together again and just chose a few colorful keycaps for some modifier keys, I liked the simple look of it (and I will never again swap out the keycaps!) My hands literally ached the entire next day. \n\nHowever, after using it for a few days, I was hooked!  You have got feel it to understand it.\n\nLayout: 60%\nConnectivity: Tri-mode\nCase: ABS\nMount Style: Gasket-mount\nPlate material: SPCC Steel\nSwitches: Ducky Inductive Switches-linear, 3.5 mm total travel, 40g initial force\nDampening Design: Ducky QUACK Mechanics+ with 7-layer dampening\nKeycaps: Ducky 85% high-purity PBT Double-shot PBT\nStabalizers: Ducky Plate-Mounted\nHot-Swappable: Yes\nReport Rate: 1000 Hz\nSoftware: Web-based \nModifier Keycaps - Double-shot PBT (Ali Express)\n\n",

And I love it! I got all parts and built it nearly two days ago.\n\nI had no experience on mechanical keyboards (unless we count typing some Red Dragon keyboard I found in some store for one second), so I was gambling how the switches should behave. And I really like what I chose... I don't want to say I hit the jackpot yet, still a very new keyboard.\n\nThe keycaps have an uneven height... You can see on the function keys on the middle. But so far, not an actual issue when using my keyboard. And they're like soft on the touch, I really like that. I really liked the look of the MOA profile, and I think they're comfortable in general, especially when playing Tetris - my fingers sit on them seemingly flawlessly.\n\nNot on the sound test video but basically the numpad has a clacky sound in addition. Not (very) loud, especially how I'll almost only use it on Blender, pressing one specific key before I move back to the other keyboard or my mouse.\n\nInserting the keycaps on slot with stabalizers... For the stubborn ones (the enter key being the worst offender) - and I'll admit I don't know if it even actually worked or I was just lucky (I was past at my sleep schedule at that point lmao), I was raising and centering the cross thingies, then have the respective keyboard upside down with my hand (or arm, 1kg keyboard lmao), and insert they keycap in. I had to do all that process more than once with a couple of keycaps, but I did manage to make sure the stabalizers actually do their job.\n\nI have two PCs (a tower, and a tiny Single Board Computer), so the wireless features on both keyboards are reeeeally comfortable for me. I don't mind the keyboard's weight when I have to take out my graphics tablet, my desk is big enough to move around everything I need.",

Its based around an ESP32 CYD display, with a rotary encoder knob). Ideally I don't want to print up a board for this, and would really just like to have flying leads to my IO breakout. \n\nI'm really struggling to get leads to stick to the pins without them oxidising, melting... If it were a few switches I could just about do it, but getting 12 to stick is becoming challenging, and I fear for the longevity of it.\n\nChatGPT seemed to suggest there were keyswitches available with flying leads in place, but I have a strong suspicion its hallucinating given I can't find a single one. Getting a PCB printed is going to be expensive (and I'm already into the too much time / money sunk on random bits stage).\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas or experience in how to reliably connect to the switches? I was hoping I could crimp Dupont style connectors to them, but it seems risky (large moment of force on the thin legs) and theres not much vertical space.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4djk5f1j7avf1.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=d690575f4cfb23c6db93e1b3879d37c69b689d97\n\n  \n",

It works again.  \n\\- brought it home, the thing works well... until it goes into sleep mode.  \n\\- after waking up from sleep mode, nothing works. Have to open the whole thing and close it.... and it works  again... until it falls asleep.\n\nIdk how to convince this retailer to swap me a new one. They keep trying to fix it. I don't think they have a refund policy. I'm so tired of this piece of modern technology. I have brought it to the shop 5 times and there's going to be a 6th for this new sleep issue. And maybe on the 2nd month it will invent itself another issue\n\nImo it is the best sounding paperweight I have had, not a functioning keyboard though",

    "title": "4x10 Ortho Handwire",
    "selftext": "It’s so little!\n\nIn my ongoing quest to have all the orthos, I present my 4x10 entry. \n\nI had always been leery of qaz layouts, while I am comfortable working with layers going from 12 to 10 columns and dropping most of the modifiers into layers just seemed like a bridge too far. But, it is a logical step from planckland, so I decided to dig into it. \n\nSurprisingly, what I discovered when planning keymaps is that I really don’t need that many modifiers for normal typing, and the ones I need most fit along the bottom row just fine, making the layered modifiers really more of a matter of tucking away things I don’t use a lot anyway. That said, this is the first layout I have done with two essential layers - usually I can get the rest of the keys onto a single layer when laying out a 40, but this one does need an up and a down.\n\nIt’s not daily driver material, but it’s a nice change of pace keyboard and it has a singular spot in my collection.\n\nAlso, it’s the first linear switch keyboard I’ve made since the first mechanical keyboard I ever had. I had some magic girl switches I had bought thinking they were tactiles like my magic girl darks, but buyer beware. I figured I would use them eventually. They’re a little scratchy but they are a good weight. Also the housing color was a really good fit for the rest of the build, which counts for more than I like to admit on my visible handwires.\n\nAnyway, the case is printed parts from an open source design I found on github called the banime. I was inspired to do this build by the acai, but I didn’t find any case files for it directly and this was my favorite alternative design. The little mcu cutout is a handy bit when trying to squeeze in all those wires. I sent the body away to be resin printed in china. These cost a lot now but they’re still 1/3 to 1/4 of getting the same material domestically. Still, I can’t go buying too many, my next couple of projects are stacked acryllic cases I can get locally. \n\nMcu is a helios, the best rp2040 mcu for the money. The cheap ones are tempting, but only the helios and the wisdpi tiny seem to be consistently free from annoying quirks and defects in the pro micro form factor rp2040 world - I usually use rp2040 because I have a lot of working code to riff on and because I like their bootloader method the most.\n\nCaps are drop mt3 fairlanes. I didn’t love these in person as much as I did online. The legend contrast on the alphas is annoyingly low, but this seems to be the build that they finally gelled with. \n\nWiring is vanilla, no weird science this time out. The layout is this one’s trick.\n\nMy next ortho on the desk will probably be a 4x13 I found recently that’s squeezed into a 12.75 wide minivan case. I am running out of new layouts until I learn to do the CAD to make my own cases - at which point I’m doing the 6x10 ortho you didn’t know you needed.",

    "title": "[RULES UPDATE] Media Only Post, Typing Apps, Games, and Extensions, Combatting Spam",
    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

If you guys have any suggestions of where I should sell this or if anyone would like to partner with me, please let me know.\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**ANSI60**\n\nA 4mm keyboard plate with multiple layout support.\n\n**Supported Layouts**\n\n* Split Backspace\n* Split Right Shift\n* Stepped Caps Lock\n* 7u Spacebar\n\n[Supported Layouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YHOHfZDZJXJPjWIfWgxHSUXzf9Ksx9y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Aluminum\n* Polycarbonate (PC)\n\n**Compatibility**\n\n* **Mounting styles:** Tray Mount\n* **Form factor:** 60% ANSI\n\n**Supported PCBs**\n\n* Venom HE 60% PCB\n* GH60 and DZ60 variants\n* Wooting 60HE\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**Introduction / Vision**\n\nIntroducing the **ANSI60** — a 4mm keyboard plate crafted for enthusiasts seeking to push the boundaries of typing acoustics and feel.   \nAt nearly three times the thickness of a standard 1.5mm plate, the ANSI60 transforms vibrational behavior, producing a crisper, more rounded tone with a fuller frequency response across the sound spectrum.\n\nMore than just thicker — the ANSI60 delivers a distinct typing experience unlike standard 1.5mm plates. With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested.

    "title": "HMX Firecracker has tickled a weird part of my brain and I may never recover: a review.",
    "selftext": "First and foremost - I'm a tactile switch lover through and through. I've tried a fair number this year, the most recent being the Sillyworks x Gateron Type R. I've tried both more budget options (I see you Akko V3 Cream Blue Pro!) and more premium offerings like the Drop x Invyr Holy Pandas. I've spent too much money but honestly I no longer care because I may have found IT. The one. Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

A few of them are close in tone, but I’ve been staring at them too long to know what actually works anymore.\n\nBefore I commit to a final direction (samples are already ordered), I’d really appreciate input on:\n\n• Which of the 6 colourways you guys think works best and would compliment your boards nicely?\n\n• Any suggestions for alternate colours for either the characters themselves or the gradient?\n\n• Any that feel like instant no-gos?\n\nI know loud designs aren’t for everyone, but feedback and input either way is appreciated.\n\nOnce the samples arrive I’ll post real photos - and if they print terribly, I’ll disappear into a hole forever.\n\nCheers",

I will be also connecting two wireless peripherals in the USB hub at the back of the monitor so it’ll take up less port space on my laptop since there is no port space left lol.\n\nThe main reason I did get it was because of the extra USB ports and because I needed an upgrade of my old monitor.

Especially in Europe where the G40XMN (or how its called) won't be sold, for whatever reason. I will not get too much into the technical site of things like color gamut or anything, take this review as one made by a standard gamer, not a monitor enthusiast. Displayninja has a more in depth review.\n\n**TLDR:**  \nI prefer the KTC. It has a few weakpoints, mainly slightly more visible ghosting in the UFO-Test and a really slight vignette on the edges against white Websites etc. Both of those are not noticeable while gaming. The HDR is way better than on the AOC with way less hastle. Local Dimming is also better. \n\n**My Demands:**  \nI built a new gaming PC after \\~10 Years. It has a 9070XT and I want to play with decent FPS but with very high graphic settings, I actually like Raytraycing. At 27\" 1440p is the best choice for me. I care about colors, blacks and highlights in games, but I also work quite a lot from home, so an OLED is not for me. My prior monitors where some old chunky 1080p 1900x1200 TN Panels. I am not really sensible to black smearing I think, I tried to see it but It never bothers me and I actually don't really see it.\n\n**Decision Process:**  \nStarting out, I watched a lot of reviews from Monitors Unboxed and RTINGS. I first got a good Fast IPS Panel from MSI. Cyberpunk seemed breathtaking at first, the city was vivid and the colors popped. But then it got to nighttime... And the edges where glowing. I thought it was because of too much light in my room, but yeah it was just IPS glow. This was something I couldn't bring myself to like, so I ordered the AOC and after some back and forth I sent the MSI back. My reasoning was: no backlight bleed, better HDR in theory, good text clarity and I thought I will get this as a interim monitor until the technology gets better. I know that the Xiaomi exists as well, but I heard that this has bad firmware and a few other problems, with no way of updating and I didn't want to gamble on the firmware version.\n\n**The AOC:**  \nThis monitor was not that great out of the box. It had a red tint, so had to calibrate to monitor, to some recommendations by a redditor. HDR just looked washed out. I was honestly pretty disappointed at first. The SDR mode looked pretty good after some calibrating, and it obviously doesn't have the bleeding problem. That's why I kept it.   \nMy solution to the HDR was using the \"vivid games\" setting in the AMD Drivers for specific games, that I played with HDR. Because otherwise these would be too unsaturated and looked as if they had a grey/beige film over them. With those settings the games looked pretty good in HDR. After those steps the monitor was good to use. But getting there was a pain, the OSD is okay in itself but navigating with those buttons is shit.   \nAnother Problem I just ended up accepting with was the VRR-Flicker against blue(-ish) backgrounds. This was not really fixable for me. In some games it could be fixed with setting the monitor to a lower framerate in the windows settings. In other games it wasn't fixable at all. As I didn't want to go into those settings every time I just accepted it. One thing I noticed when comparing the HDR performance in HDR videos to the KTC is that the dimming algorithm doesn't seem to be as good. There where often some back-led ever so slightly visible, which bothered me. Also blooming is a bit of an issue, which is. to be expected with 356 or so dimming zones.\n\nOverall the AOC provided me with a pretty good HDR experience once I finished a long calibration and troubleshooting process. Though it was never perfect.\n\n**The KTC:**  \nI didn't know about the two Mini-LED KTC monitors up until last week. I knew that KTC is not the most reputable brand, but that they are OEM-Manufacture for bigger brands, so they know a thing or two about building monitors. I don't really care about all of that though. I saw that the KTC was on sale at the prime sale in Germany for 250€, which is 80€ less than I paid for the AOC. I quickly read some reviews, which there are pretty few of and decided to take the risk. As is seemed to improve on the AOC as well as the Xiaomi (it has a USB port for updates).  \nSetting it up was pretty easy. I set up the brightness to my preferred setting, lowered the black equalizer, for better contrasts and set HDR to DisplayHDR. Navigating the OSD is way more intuitive, due to the joystick-like controls. I then launched Cyberpunk and was pretty horrified, why do all my colors look like a unicorn puked on my monitor? Remembered that I had to turn on the vivid games setting. Turned that off and well, thats how HDR is supposed to look like. It was way better than the AOC. Also in other games like Jedi: Survivor and BF6 HDR looked just way better. Highlights were great and the blacks as well. And: I don't have any VRR-Flicker. I can just set the monitor to 180Hz with VRR and don't think about it, what a feeling! Blooming in HDR content is also noticeably reduced. So all in all HDR is just great on this monitor and significantly better compared to the AOC.  \nIt is not just perfect though. When working on the screen I noticed a slight vignette-like effect on the edges, which changes depending on the viewing angle. Its like 2-3 pixels wide and only really visible against white backgrounds/websites. While gaming I don't notice it at all. Also it was a slight bit worse with ghosting in the UFO-Test compared to the AOC. Something that is noticeable in a controlled test, like the UFO-Test but also not at all noticeable when gaming or watching content or using it in any other way.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI am really happy with the KTC it improves on the worst aspects of the AOC but also improves the points, where the AOC was also good to begin with. Mainly the HDR performance is way better, VRR-Flicker is not problem for me and it's cheaper as well. For me, my preferences and use cases it's just a more polished and hassle free experience. Even though it has some drawbacks, I would recommend this monitor over the AOC for people who want a good and affordable HDR experience and also for people who want to get into Mini-LED to get rid of their IPS glow.   \nThe third group that will enjoy this monitor are the ones that want a Mini-LED now and maybe wait for the bigger brands like ASUS, Samsung, LG etc. to launch better and more polished products compared to the AOC and the KTC, which will inevitably happen at some point. It feels good to spend 250-270€ (which it usually costs with an amazon coupon in Germany) on a monitor that performs really well now, as it is also viable to upgrade once something better launches and use this monitor as a second screen. But for now I'm set (the AOC is my second screen). ",

It still goes away afterward, but it’s making me wonder if this could be an early sign of the panel or some component starting to go bad.\n\nHas anyone else had something similar happen with this model (or other VA panels)?

On my setup I have an Acer and LG, and for my entire life with this display, be it windows, ubuntu, debian, manjaro, or fedora, across multiple DEs and WMs, this monitor has always had issues detected input. In linux I can usually \"force\" it awake by switching to TTY and back, but for detecting BIOS? Forget about it. Turning it off and coming back and turning it on and logging in? I can't see shit until login, \\*maybe\\*. The second LG monitor was a godsend because I could actually see if I was typing in a password field or not. \n\n  \nI've built a couple PCs as well while having this Acer monitor, and when it comes time to test if the machine POSTs, or get to BIOS or install a new OS or whatever, I gotta hook up to the LG monitor. I was just setting up a new PC in my partner's office, who also has an Acer monitor, and spend an hour trying to figure out why windows wasn't booting until I heard the windows \"disconnect device\" sound come from the speakers on a machine I hadn't even thought was POSTing. Oh shit, of course, Acer monitor. Dragged the LG over, plugged it in, machine has been booting straight through to windows every time without problem, the Acer monitor just wasn't properly detecting input. \n\n  \nI'm at the point where I'm writing off this brand forever.

    "selftext": "I wasn’t actively searching for a monitor, but after browsing Best Buy’s website for a while, I stumbled upon a 57-inch Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 monitor that was open box and in excellent condition for just $561. I had a $50 Best Buy gift card, so I was looking for a budget-friendly option, but this deal seemed too good to be true. Despite the repeated message that the monitor was no longer in stock, I decided to proceed with the purchase. Surprisingly, the purchase went through, and I was able to pick it up at a Best Buy location about an hour and a half away. I couldn’t believe I had gotten the 57-inch monitor for such a low price. Am I hallucinating, or is this an incredible deal?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently moved to a new place for a new job and I’m still setting up my apartment. One of the first things I want to get is a monitor that can work well for both productivity and gaming.\n\nHere’s my setup and what I’m looking for:\n\n* I have two laptops:\n   * A Legion 5 Pro (2021) gaming laptop (slightly old, but I mostly play FIFA on it; runs fine on low settings).\n   * A work laptop that I’ll use 8-9 hours a day for coding, documentation, and meetings.\n* I want a monitor that I can easily switch between both laptops (for example, one on HDMI, one on USB-C or DisplayPort).\n* I also plan to buy a PS5 soon, so I’d love a monitor that would be great for consoles too.\n\nI’m looking for something in the 27\"-32\" range. I’ll mostly use it for work during the day and for gaming/content (movies, YouTube, etc.) after hours.\n\nI was eyeing some OLED models but I’m a bit concerned about burn-in since the monitor will be on for long workdays. If OLED isn’t ideal for my use case, I’m open to high-quality IPS or VA panels too.\n\n**Budget:** Having a hard deciding this. On one hand, I do not want to spend much but on the other, I feel like it's a one-time investment for a long time and it does boost productivity too. Also, having experienced some high-end QLED TVs before, I am not easily impressed by displays.\n\nWould love recommendations or personal experiences with monitors that fit this mix of work + gaming + console use.\n\n**TL;DR: my main questions:**\n\n1. What panel type should I go for (OLED vs IPS vs VA)?\n2. Do OLED panels still have noticeable burn-in risk in 2025 for all-day work use?\n3. What resolution makes the most sense, is 4K worth it, or is QHD good enough?\n4. If I had to trade off quality to save money, is it better to go for QHD on a better panel or 4K on a worse one?\n5. Should I consider a dual-monitor setup, one for gaming/content and a cheaper one for static work tasks?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

    "selftext": "I have this QNIX QX2710 27\" IPS in 1440p that I've been using for a few years that a friend gave me when he upgraded. Honestly it's been a great monitor for my older rig but I'm looking to build a new PC soon and the donor RTX 3080 I'll be using until I get something else won't work with the Dual-Link DVI on this monitor. I've spent the last month or two looking around at all the newer monitors and I'm having a difficult time finding something I like and want to spend my money on. I'm not ready to spend $500+ on an OLED just yet, but I likely will within the next year when something nice catches my eye. Basically, I'm treating this current \"upgrade\" as my eventual second monitor, even though it will be my current main monitor. I have an old 24\" BenQ 1080p monitor I currently use as my secondary and I'll probably continue to use in vertical config once I have 3 monitors.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of video content, but I also do a good bit of other general task work, so I'm hesitant to get a VA monitor because once I get an OLED that will handle all the game/video content that requires the high contrast and refresh rates. I'd rather have an IPS for now since gaming has been fine on the QNIX (I don't play anything super competitive) and I don't want to deal with bad viewing angles or weird flicker. It seems like none of the last few years of IPS have gloss panels though, which is unfortunate because I really love how it looks on the QNIX.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions on a 27\" 1440p IPS and least 100/120hz for under $300? Ideally I don't want to spend over $200, and in the perfect world I'd love to find something for $100. How far back in time do I have to go to find a 2k IPS with a gloss screen that has HDMI or DP? I don't really care about HDR on this as it seems like the majority of IPS have bad implementation of it, and I can wait until an OLED for that anyways. It should also be VESA compatible so I can ditch the stand and put it on an arm, so I don't care if the stand is junk either.\n\nHopefully someone else has gone through this recently and can offer some suggestions. I feel like I'm in monitor hell digging through hundreds of reviews and threads trying to find what I want. I'm \\*this\\* close to just buying a cheap HDMI-DVI converter and living with 1440p@60hz until I get an OLED.",

I'm primarily looking at text for document editing/review, email, video calls, etc. I'm upgrading from a 27\" 1080p screen, which is horribly grainy.\n\nI'm looking to get two 4k monitors and am currently between Dell's S2725QS (240USD) and U2725QE (630USD) models. The advantages of the QE appear to be a somewhat nicer picture, better build quality, and an internal hub, whereas the QS has no hub features at all. My gut says to get two of the much cheaper QS and connect everything with an external hub. However, I don't know how to assess if the difference in picture quality justifies the price difference of almost $400/screen. I'm very picky about picture quality and could afford the QE, but I don't want to drop the money for a marginal gain in how nice my word documents look. I could get one of each to take advantage of the hub in one, but I worry having two slightly different monitors next to one another would be distracting.\n\nAnyone have experience with these screens and can say whether the difference in quality is noticeable? Is having the hub inside the screen vs. in an external peripheral preferable? Or is there another monitor entirely I should be considering?",

I mostly code on the laptop, so I don’t necessarily want a gaming monitor (I game very rarely). I’m currently coming from a 24″ Full HD (1920×1080), 75 Hz ASUS monitor, and because my laptop has a 120 Hz screen I feel the difference — and I want an upgrade.  \nThe thing that frustrates me the most is **stutter** on the laptop’s screen (when the external monitor is connected), which I assume comes from the difference in refresh rate between the external monitor and the laptop screen. I thought about getting a monitor also at 120 Hz (same as the laptop), but I’ve heard many bad opinions about those monitors, so I’m open to any recommendation.  \nMy **only requirements** are:\n\n1. The monitor must be **at least 120 Hz**.\n2. The budget is up to **300 euros**. My main deal-breaker is the stutter. I really want to get rid of it. If you have suggestions or know what to look out for, I’d appreciate the help!",

I believe it’s a VA panel but I’ve had it for years so kinda forgot the specifics of it. \n\nMy current monitor works perfect, it’s not the best picture but I’ve been happen with it over the years. \n\nI’d like to stay with a 32 inch monitor and the highest refresh rate I can get to keep up with the 5090. \n\nI was very interested in the ASUS Swift PG32UCDM or the Samsung Odyssey G81SF but both are QD-OLED. I love how the picture quality is on both but I also have to use this monitor for work. I currently spend anywhere from 6-10 hours working in various programs side-by-side with lots of static images. On the nights that I game after work, that’ll be a few more hours with static HUDs etc. \n\nThat makes me a little hesitant to get a OLED screen even though both manufacturers have built in screen protection. I’ve heard and seen in reviews that OLED burn-in is still a very real issue. \n\nAre there any other monitors with a high refresh rate but better quality than what I have now? \n\nShould I get an OLED monitor and risk burn in?\n\nI’d prefer to stay with a 32 inch but go to a non-curved if I can. I’d also like to stay with 1440p but if 4K gaming on the 5090 is better than gaming at 1440p, I’ll make that jump. \n\nTIA!",

    "selftext": "We’ve started a **partnership with Titan Army** and will be showcasing new models going forward (with honest community feedback) and probably some giveaways in the future. First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters. [P2712V Link](https://bit.ly/4gmDFse)\n\n**P275MV Plus (Mini-LED with DyDs)**\n\n* Same **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** dual mode\n* **Mini-LED FALD (1152 zones), HDR1000**\n* **What is DyDs**: the backlight is driven in sync with the panel update to keep motion clean **with local dimming on** and to improve visibility in dark scenes (less smearing/black crush than typical FALD IPS). [P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

    "title": "KTC M27T6 vs. AOC Q27G3XMN Review",
    "selftext": "Hey folks, I recently bought the KTC M27T6 and I have the AOC Q27G3XMN (the latter I have for about half a year), so I thought I make a quick review and comparison, as those are two of the main competitors in the low budget HDR Mini-LED Market. Especially in Europe where the G40XMN (or how its called) won't be sold, for whatever reason. I will not get too much into the technical site of things like color gamut or anything, take this review as one made by a standard gamer, not a monitor enthusiast. Displayninja has a more in depth review.\n\n**TLDR:**  \nI prefer the KTC. It has a few weakpoints, mainly slightly more visible ghosting in the UFO-Test and a really slight vignette on the edges against white Websites etc. Both of those are not noticeable while gaming. The HDR is way better than on the AOC with way less hastle. Local Dimming is also better. \n\n**My Demands:**  \nI built a new gaming PC after \\~10 Years. It has a 9070XT and I want to play with decent FPS but with very high graphic settings, I actually like Raytraycing. At 27\" 1440p is the best choice for me. I care about colors, blacks and highlights in games, but I also work quite a lot from home, so an OLED is not for me. My prior monitors where some old chunky 1080p 1900x1200 TN Panels. I am not really sensible to black smearing I think, I tried to see it but It never bothers me and I actually don't really see it.\n\n**Decision Process:**  \nStarting out, I watched a lot of reviews from Monitors Unboxed and RTINGS. I first got a good Fast IPS Panel from MSI. Cyberpunk seemed breathtaking at first, the city was vivid and the colors popped. But then it got to nighttime... And the edges where glowing. I thought it was because of too much light in my room, but yeah it was just IPS glow. This was something I couldn't bring myself to like, so I ordered the AOC and after some back and forth I sent the MSI back. My reasoning was: no backlight bleed, better HDR in theory, good text clarity and I thought I will get this as a interim monitor until the technology gets better. I know that the Xiaomi exists as well, but I heard that this has bad firmware and a few other problems, with no way of updating and I didn't want to gamble on the firmware version.\n\n**The AOC:**  \nThis monitor was not that great out of the box. It had a red tint, so had to calibrate to monitor, to some recommendations by a redditor. HDR just looked washed out. I was honestly pretty disappointed at first. The SDR mode looked pretty good after some calibrating, and it obviously doesn't have the bleeding problem. That's why I kept it.   \nMy solution to the HDR was using the \"vivid games\" setting in the AMD Drivers for specific games, that I played with HDR. Because otherwise these would be too unsaturated and looked as if they had a grey/beige film over them. With those settings the games looked pretty good in HDR. After those steps the monitor was good to use. But getting there was a pain, the OSD is okay in itself but navigating with those buttons is shit.   \nAnother Problem I just ended up accepting with was the VRR-Flicker against blue(-ish) backgrounds. This was not really fixable for me. In some games it could be fixed with setting the monitor to a lower framerate in the windows settings. In other games it wasn't fixable at all. As I didn't want to go into those settings every time I just accepted it. One thing I noticed when comparing the HDR performance in HDR videos to the KTC is that the dimming algorithm doesn't seem to be as good. There where often some back-led ever so slightly visible, which bothered me. Also blooming is a bit of an issue, which is. to be expected with 356 or so dimming zones.\n\nOverall the AOC provided me with a pretty good HDR experience once I finished a long calibration and troubleshooting process. Though it was never perfect.\n\n**The KTC:**  \nI didn't know about the two Mini-LED KTC monitors up until last week. I knew that KTC is not the most reputable brand, but that they are OEM-Manufacture for bigger brands, so they know a thing or two about building monitors. I don't really care about all of that though. I saw that the KTC was on sale at the prime sale in Germany for 250€, which is 80€ less than I paid for the AOC. I quickly read some reviews, which there are pretty few of and decided to take the risk. As is seemed to improve on the AOC as well as the Xiaomi (it has a USB port for updates).  \nSetting it up was pretty easy. I set up the brightness to my preferred setting, lowered the black equalizer, for better contrasts and set HDR to DisplayHDR. Navigating the OSD is way more intuitive, due to the joystick-like controls. I then launched Cyberpunk and was pretty horrified, why do all my colors look like a unicorn puked on my monitor? Remembered that I had to turn on the vivid games setting. Turned that off and well, thats how HDR is supposed to look like. It was way better than the AOC. Also in other games like Jedi: Survivor and BF6 HDR looked just way better. Highlights were great and the blacks as well. And: I don't have any VRR-Flicker. I can just set the monitor to 180Hz with VRR and don't think about it, what a feeling! Blooming in HDR content is also noticeably reduced. So all in all HDR is just great on this monitor and significantly better compared to the AOC.  \nIt is not just perfect though. When working on the screen I noticed a slight vignette-like effect on the edges, which changes depending on the viewing angle. Its like 2-3 pixels wide and only really visible against white backgrounds/websites. While gaming I don't notice it at all. Also it was a slight bit worse with ghosting in the UFO-Test compared to the AOC. Something that is noticeable in a controlled test, like the UFO-Test but also not at all noticeable when gaming or watching content or using it in any other way.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI am really happy with the KTC it improves on the worst aspects of the AOC but also improves the points, where the AOC was also good to begin with. Mainly the HDR performance is way better, VRR-Flicker is not problem for me and it's cheaper as well. For me, my preferences and use cases it's just a more polished and hassle free experience. Even though it has some drawbacks, I would recommend this monitor over the AOC for people who want a good and affordable HDR experience and also for people who want to get into Mini-LED to get rid of their IPS glow.   \nThe third group that will enjoy this monitor are the ones that want a Mini-LED now and maybe wait for the bigger brands like ASUS, Samsung, LG etc. to launch better and more polished products compared to the AOC and the KTC, which will inevitably happen at some point. It feels good to spend 250-270€ (which it usually costs with an amazon coupon in Germany) on a monitor that performs really well now, as it is also viable to upgrade once something better launches and use this monitor as a second screen. But for now I'm set (the AOC is my second screen). ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI’ve got an MSI MAG 241CR, and for the past 2–3 years it’s always shown a few horizontal lines for around 5–10 seconds right after I turn on my PC. They disappear completely afterward, and the monitor works perfectly fine for gaming or normal use.\n\nRecently though, the lines have started looking a bit worse or more noticeable during those first few seconds. It still goes away afterward, but it’s making me wonder if this could be an early sign of the panel or some component starting to go bad.\n\nHas anyone else had something similar happen with this model (or other VA panels)? Curious if this is just an aging quirk or something I should actually be concerned about.",

    "title": "KTC M27T6 vs. AOC Q27G3XMN Review",
    "selftext": "Hey folks, I recently bought the KTC M27T6 and I have the AOC Q27G3XMN (the latter I have for about half a year), so I thought I make a quick review and comparison, as those are two of the main competitors in the low budget HDR Mini-LED Market. Especially in Europe where the G40XMN (or how its called) won't be sold, for whatever reason. I will not get too much into the technical site of things like color gamut or anything, take this review as one made by a standard gamer, not a monitor enthusiast. Displayninja has a more in depth review.\n\n**TLDR:**  \nI prefer the KTC. It has a few weakpoints, mainly slightly more visible ghosting in the UFO-Test and a really slight vignette on the edges against white Websites etc. Both of those are not noticeable while gaming. The HDR is way better than on the AOC with way less hastle. Local Dimming is also better. \n\n**My Demands:**  \nI built a new gaming PC after \\~10 Years. It has a 9070XT and I want to play with decent FPS but with very high graphic settings, I actually like Raytraycing. At 27\" 1440p is the best choice for me. I care about colors, blacks and highlights in games, but I also work quite a lot from home, so an OLED is not for me. My prior monitors where some old chunky 1080p 1900x1200 TN Panels. I am not really sensible to black smearing I think, I tried to see it but It never bothers me and I actually don't really see it.\n\n**Decision Process:**  \nStarting out, I watched a lot of reviews from Monitors Unboxed and RTINGS. I first got a good Fast IPS Panel from MSI. Cyberpunk seemed breathtaking at first, the city was vivid and the colors popped. But then it got to nighttime... And the edges where glowing. I thought it was because of too much light in my room, but yeah it was just IPS glow. This was something I couldn't bring myself to like, so I ordered the AOC and after some back and forth I sent the MSI back. My reasoning was: no backlight bleed, better HDR in theory, good text clarity and I thought I will get this as a interim monitor until the technology gets better. I know that the Xiaomi exists as well, but I heard that this has bad firmware and a few other problems, with no way of updating and I didn't want to gamble on the firmware version.\n\n**The AOC:**  \nThis monitor was not that great out of the box. It had a red tint, so had to calibrate to monitor, to some recommendations by a redditor. HDR just looked washed out. I was honestly pretty disappointed at first. The SDR mode looked pretty good after some calibrating, and it obviously doesn't have the bleeding problem. That's why I kept it.   \nMy solution to the HDR was using the \"vivid games\" setting in the AMD Drivers for specific games, that I played with HDR. Because otherwise these would be too unsaturated and looked as if they had a grey/beige film over them. With those settings the games looked pretty good in HDR. After those steps the monitor was good to use. But getting there was a pain, the OSD is okay in itself but navigating with those buttons is shit.   \nAnother Problem I just ended up accepting with was the VRR-Flicker against blue(-ish) backgrounds. This was not really fixable for me. In some games it could be fixed with setting the monitor to a lower framerate in the windows settings. In other games it wasn't fixable at all. As I didn't want to go into those settings every time I just accepted it. One thing I noticed when comparing the HDR performance in HDR videos to the KTC is that the dimming algorithm doesn't seem to be as good. There where often some back-led ever so slightly visible, which bothered me. Also blooming is a bit of an issue, which is. to be expected with 356 or so dimming zones.\n\nOverall the AOC provided me with a pretty good HDR experience once I finished a long calibration and troubleshooting process. Though it was never perfect.\n\n**The KTC:**  \nI didn't know about the two Mini-LED KTC monitors up until last week. I knew that KTC is not the most reputable brand, but that they are OEM-Manufacture for bigger brands, so they know a thing or two about building monitors. I don't really care about all of that though. I saw that the KTC was on sale at the prime sale in Germany for 250€, which is 80€ less than I paid for the AOC. I quickly read some reviews, which there are pretty few of and decided to take the risk. As is seemed to improve on the AOC as well as the Xiaomi (it has a USB port for updates).  \nSetting it up was pretty easy. I set up the brightness to my preferred setting, lowered the black equalizer, for better contrasts and set HDR to DisplayHDR. Navigating the OSD is way more intuitive, due to the joystick-like controls. I then launched Cyberpunk and was pretty horrified, why do all my colors look like a unicorn puked on my monitor? Remembered that I had to turn on the vivid games setting. Turned that off and well, thats how HDR is supposed to look like. It was way better than the AOC. Also in other games like Jedi: Survivor and BF6 HDR looked just way better. Highlights were great and the blacks as well. And: I don't have any VRR-Flicker. I can just set the monitor to 180Hz with VRR and don't think about it, what a feeling! Blooming in HDR content is also noticeably reduced. So all in all HDR is just great on this monitor and significantly better compared to the AOC.  \nIt is not just perfect though. When working on the screen I noticed a slight vignette-like effect on the edges, which changes depending on the viewing angle. Its like 2-3 pixels wide and only really visible against white backgrounds/websites. While gaming I don't notice it at all. Also it was a slight bit worse with ghosting in the UFO-Test compared to the AOC. Something that is noticeable in a controlled test, like the UFO-Test but also not at all noticeable when gaming or watching content or using it in any other way.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI am really happy with the KTC it improves on the worst aspects of the AOC but also improves the points, where the AOC was also good to begin with. Mainly the HDR performance is way better, VRR-Flicker is not problem for me and it's cheaper as well. For me, my preferences and use cases it's just a more polished and hassle free experience. Even though it has some drawbacks, I would recommend this monitor over the AOC for people who want a good and affordable HDR experience and also for people who want to get into Mini-LED to get rid of their IPS glow.   \nThe third group that will enjoy this monitor are the ones that want a Mini-LED now and maybe wait for the bigger brands like ASUS, Samsung, LG etc. to launch better and more polished products compared to the AOC and the KTC, which will inevitably happen at some point. It feels good to spend 250-270€ (which it usually costs with an amazon coupon in Germany) on a monitor that performs really well now, as it is also viable to upgrade once something better launches and use this monitor as a second screen. But for now I'm set (the AOC is my second screen). ",

I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn’t stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it’s no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they’d be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they’re better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they’re still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I’m really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say “sufficient”) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an “active analog mode” which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you’re looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC… look no further!",

    "title": "These are some Ultralight Studio Headphones I designed",
    "selftext": "This is my project headphone for my high school design course.\n\nIt needed to fit the following criteria:\n\n* comfortable for long hours with ultralight weight construction\n* sound quality on par with other reference/studio headphones\n* priced relatively affordable compared to the market\n\n**specs:**\n\n* Driver: Peerless 50 mm driver\n* mass: 170g (without cable)\n* materials:\n   * earcups: PLA-LW and PLA\n   * headband strap: Faux leather\n   * earpad: aliexpress 110mm hybrid velour\n   * everything else: PETG\n* Connection: dual 3.5mm\n\n**Comfort**\n\nBeing 170 grams already makes this a comfortable headphone; it feels weightless on the head. Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "title": "Susvara and Tubey Goodness",
    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are— 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it—do yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

They do seem to make them a bit less toasty (which was not a problem, but was noticeable with the stock pads for me). They also change the frequency response a bit, tilt it a bit to the high end, and open it up slightly. Not an improvement, for me, I like the warm, slightly more intimate feel of the stock pads a bit better, but not something that would stop me from using these either. Sound is still great. Edit: I had said that the sound isolation was not as good, but I am going back and forth now, and really, it is about the same. Also, going back and forth between the two, the sound difference really is minimal - it is there, but less then my initial impression. I don't hear much of a difference in bass either. I think the sound changes a little as the pads warm up, maybe the seal becomes a little better, and the differences, which are not much to begin with, decrease.\n\n Wondering what peoples impressions are, if anyone is still using these on their Maxwell? I am contemplating whether to keep them or not.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say — these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural — vocals, instruments, bass — nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven’t noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it’s natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head — soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn’t use them for workouts (they’re not built for that kind of movement), but they’re fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal — so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you’re in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you’ve already paired — that’s super convenient. Battery life is great too — around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere’s also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I’ve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I’ve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They’re not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they’re absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

Perhaps not as high quality sound as their main 7xx/8xx/9xx line, but I wonder how different it really sounds. Made in China like the 240 Pro, not Germany like most of their pro sets. ",

I'll primarily be using them with my iPhone 12 Pro.\n\nI've been reading a lot about how using a Bluetooth dongle, like the Sennheiser BTD 600, is essential to get the absolute best sound quality out of these with an iPhone. The catch is that these dongles are USB-C and my iPhone is Lightning.\n\nI found this USB-C to Lightning adapter and was wondering a couple of things:\n * Has anyone here tried this kind of adapter setup with the BTD 600 and a Lightning iPhone? Does it actually work?\n * For those who have used the dongle with an iPhone/iOS device, does it really make a significant difference to the sound quality compared to the standard Bluetooth connection (which uses AAC)?\n\nAny advice would be awesome! Thanks in advance! 🎧\n",

    "selftext": "So the last few weeks I’ve been hunting for my first pair of real headphones. I’ve been using Astro A50s for a while they’re great for gaming, but man, they get super uncomfortable after like an hour.\n\nI’m totally new to the audiophile world, and holy hell, there are so many options. I had no clue where to start, so of course I did what any sane person would do I went to Reddit. I got a few a different suggestions but as I was searching through all of them I ended up looking up the Meze 109 pros and immediately fell in love with the looks. The wood finish on the cups matches my setup perfectly.\n\nSo I take the plunge — $800 on the 109 Pros and another $200 on a Topping DX3 Pro+. Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and… they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn’t notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I’d just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I’d give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two — same story. Day three, same thing at first… until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I’d never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I’m just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I’m not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

    "selftext": "First off, I am new to the headphone space so please excuse my lack of understanding.\n\nI have noticed that most reviewers, whether that's a review on YouTube, or an article on their website, place heavy emphasis on the frequency response curve. They will place this above all else when it comes to sound quality.\nFrom what I understand, frequency response curve is more indicative of a headphones 'sound signature' or what the manufacturer intended it to sound like but is not the only or imo main factor in the overall sound quality. \nFor example, when you compare a cheap pair of headphones to a more expensive one, no matter how well the cheap pair is tuned, it will still lack detail or resolution that the more expensive headphone will have (based on my experience). You might not hear the small variations in the artists vocals or the instruments. It can also lack clarity in the sound. \nSo, I feel, the frequency response curve is only one aspect of the overall sound quality, but there are many more things to consider and compare. You would expect an expensive pair of headphones to still sound 'better' even if it's not tuned closer to the Harman curve compared to a cheaper pair, just because of the better drivers, better materials and superior sound processing. \n\nIf so, why do reviews not talk about the rest of the factors affecting sound quality and focus almost purely on the sound signature, which to some extent can be fixed with an EQ, when the rest of it is not adjustable? \nSometimes they make it seem as if a well tuned $50 pair is better than a $400 pair which is better better build with better materials, with it's only shortcoming being a slightly worse tuning. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Or am I approaching this wrong?\nIs sound signature the defining factor in sound quality and listening experience or should we focus equally on things like clarity, resolution, ability to recreate the small variations in the sound, distortion?\nDo they avoid it because these other factors can't be quantified easily?

    "selftext": "I've tried pretty much every \"spatial audio\" VST and DSP out there, and 99% of it is garbage. Just weird tricks that sound fake. Recently I learned about convolution. I found the ASH-IR-Dataset and just started messing with room impulse files. Then I tried one called Calypso, and that was the first time it actually felt like I was sitting in a room, not listening to a weird effect. The next game-changer was headphone correction. You have to EQ your headphones to a diffuse-field target first. It makes the headphones neutral for the simulation to work on.\n\nThat's when I found the ASH-Toolset. It took me literal days of tweaking to get a sound that wasn't just \"good\" but correct. You have to learn the settings because the defaults probably won't work for you. The most critical part is the HRTF dataset (the \"dummy head\" recordings). You have to test them all (KEMAR, KU 100, etc.) Your ears are physically unique. The HRTF that's perfect for me will sound weird and wrong to you. If you don't find the one that anatomically clicks with your brain, you will never get that true \"in front of you\" sound.\n\nFor the first time in my life, music is actually in front of me, originating from a point in space outside my head. I'm now listening to music I've ignored for years (acoustic, live concerts, old rock) and it's more engaging than the metal I've lived on for 5 years, because I can hear the actual space in the recording. The effect is insane on my IEMs, super precise and immersive. On my HD 650s, it's also incredible, but the sense of space is wider and less \"in your face,\" a totally different but equally cool vibe. If you're tired of the gimmicks and want to hear what's really possible, this is the way.\n\n(I don't know English well, so I apologize if something is written incorrectly.)\n\nupd: I wrote a short instruction on how to start using the dataset - [https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/)",

    "selftext": "\nI’ve been thinking about picking up the Audeze Maxwells for a while now since they always show up on “best gaming headset” lists.\n\nBut after looking into them more, I keep seeing people complain about driver issues or one side of the headset crapping out after a few months. Which freaks me out a bit. I want something that’ll last a few years, not fall apart after a short time even if you take really good care of them.\n\nEveryone says they’re the best-sounding gaming headset out there, which really makes me want them, but I’m not sure if I can trust the reliability.\n\nSo for anyone who owns them, are they actually worth it in the long run, or should I look at something else?",

    "selftext": "Hello. Posting here cause headphone advice auto deleted this. :( \n\nI have the DT 1990 Pros (not MKII) currently, the left driver stopped working like a week ago or so. I decided to google what could be the cause, something led me to believe that the coil wire(?), the ultra thin varnished tiny wire was broken, so I opened it and sure enough it was. Replacement drivers are $192, I bought mine in 2022 for $550. New ones now cost $300\\~$350 depending on sales and such. So I was thinking is it even worth repairing at this point or just upgrade to better headphones. My choice that I landed on (kinda heavily at this stage) are the Meze 109 Pros. I am waiting for a sale for them as I've seen them as low as $628 or so, instead of the $750 they are right now (with coupon or something). I've seen a lot of reviews of these and lot's of people say these could be considered \"end game?\" for a lot of people. I am by no means an audiophile so fair enough in this case. Another thing I heard is the cable provided with these is kinda \"meh\" for the price of the headphones and suggestions seem to say to upgrade it. Not sure to what though. Any input is wholly welcomed. Thanks!\n\nBudget I'm hoping to stick under $800.\n\nMainly for listening to music or playing a few games like Rust and such\n\nI have the SMSL AO300 AMP\n\nAny input is wholly welcomed.

But for nu-metal (Limp Bizkit and others) and electronic music, I wanted something more atmospheric and physical.  \nI listen to music on different devices and software, so EQ isn’t really an option. I like character — not neutrality.\n\nMy first shortlist was Fostex TH900 Mk2 and Sony MRZ-1, but none were available.  \nI ended up getting the FatFreq Deuce — the IEMs with the most powerful sub-bass I’ve ever heard.\n\nThen the Virtuoso was announced, and after auditioning them twice, I finally added them to my collection.\n\n**Cons for first:**\n\nFor around $1000, you get a fancy case and Alcantara on the headband and pads. That’s it. The rest of the materials and build quality feel cheap as shit. Fit isn’t particularly comfortable either. The screw-in cable connectors make me question the design logic.  \nMaybe I’m just spoiled by Meze, but overall it feels far from premium.\n\n**Sound**\n\nTested on iBasso Nunchaku, Chord Mojo 2, Astell&Kern ACRO CA1000T, and Cayin HA-2A.  \nI don’t feel any difference between the gear, so don’t overpay for it.\n\nOverall, the sound is moderately detailed with good instrument separation —  \nan aggressive V-shape with some interesting midrange nuance.  \nThe louder it gets, the richer and denser it becomes.\n\n**Bass**:  \nStrong and plentiful, but not aggressive. Moderately textured, adds weight and body.  \nElectronic and hip-hop tracks sound fantastic.\n\n**Treble**:  \nThere’s a lot of it. Crisp, sometimes aggressive on cymbals — reminds me of the Meze 109 Pro.\n\n**Mids**:  \nThis is where it gets interesting. A&K seems to have borrowed Ultrasone’s S-Logic spatial trickery,  \nso vocals float “in the air”. When the music carries ambient layers or atmospheric elements, it’s genuinely captivating.\n\nOverall, the sound is unusual yet very pleasant — cohesive, engaging, and fun to listen to.\n\nPosting this because there are almost no reviews or proper FR measurements online.  \nIf you’re looking for something unique and a bit different, maybe this will help.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I need some advice from the Audeze experts here. I'm about to buy a used LCD-X and I'm confused about which version it is.\n\n**The Facts:**\n\n* Serial Number: **7526658**\n* Purchased new: **March 10, 2021** from xxxx (authorized Swiss dealer)\n* Original invoice included\n* Current asking price: **\\~€850)** \\- seems like a good deal\n\n**The Confusion:** According to what I found online, LCD-X units with serial numbers **7527600 or higher** should be the 2021 revision. This one is 7526658, so technically *below* that threshold.\n\n**BUT** \\- and this is where it gets interesting - **the headphone has ALL the 2021 visual characteristics:**\n\n* ✅ Modern suspension headband (not the old rigid design)\n* ✅ Metal mesh grills (not fabric)\n* ✅ New shiny leather earpads (not the old memory foam style)\n* ✅ Overall 2021 aesthetic\n\nThe seller confirms **everything is original** \\- nothing has been replaced or upgraded. He bought it exactly like this in March 2021.\n\n**My Theory:** Could this be an early 2021 production unit or a transition model for the European market? Maybe Audeze started the 2021 revision slightly before the \"official\" serial number threshold, especially for international markets?\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Has anyone seen LCD-X units with 2021 components but serial numbers below 7527600?\n2. Do you think this is actually a 2021 model that just happened to get an earlier serial number?\n3. At 850 EUROS with all 2021 components visible, is this a no-brainer purchase even if there's uncertainty?\n\nI've contacted Audeze support but thought I'd ask the community too. Any insights would be really appreciated!\n\n**TL;DR:** LCD-X serial 7526658 (below 2021 threshold) but has all 2021 physical features. Bought new March 2021. Is it a 2021 model? Worth buying at €850?",

    "title": "Trying to further my understanding of headphone power needs",
    "selftext": "I made a post in HeadohonesAdvice recently asking about the plausibility of running a pair of Sennheiser HD 600 off a dongle dac. At least half of the purpose of me asking is to learn more about the technical side of this audio technology, because I love learning and I have a strong desire to understand how things work. Having a strong base of knowledge can make me a more informed consumer if nothing else. \n\nThe responses ranged from “no dongle will really provide enough power to run those headphones properly, even if it sounds loud enough” to “amps are snake oil, don’t waste your money, just use an Apple dongle or, if you really want to blast it, get a fiio ka11 or something.”\n\nI found it truly interesting that both sides of this argument vehemently insist they are correct, which leads me to believe the science that goes into answering a question like this must be very nuanced and not at all black and white. \n\nStarting with the “why volume doesn’t always mean enough power” argument, the best explanation I could find is that dynamic drivers don’t have consistent voltage needs across the entire audio spectrum. More specifically, the bass and upper treble have more power needs, and that power form what I’ve gathered is voltage for volume and current for driver control. I may be oversimplifying or possibly just wrong so forgive me, but the broader point is that even if the sound in general sounds loud enough and is therefore getting enough power, parts of the frequency response might not be getting what they need especially when it comes to music with a lot of dynamic range or large peaks in volume. The idea here is that “it sounds loud enough to me” could be an incomplete picture. \n\nOn the other side of the argument I’m seeing that the above argument is a hypothetical and over complicated concern, that for a high-impedance set like the HD 600 if you can get it loud enough for normal listening then you are supplying it with all the power it needs since voltage equals volume and voltage is the main concern with a headphone like this (as opposed to a set that has low impedance but high current needs). Even Crinacle, a popular figure in the audiophile space, claims that something like the ka11 can provide “way too much power” and could easily run a set of HD 800s at “ear-splitting volume”.  Not that his word is gold, or anything, but he still strikes me as someone with a lot of experience and knowledge. \n\nMeanwhile back on the other side again, you can look up power calculators for headphones that more or less verify most dongles won’t be able to supply the necessary voltage or current for high impedance headphones to run at max potential/without clipping part of the frequency response. \n\nApologies for the wall of text here, I just wanted to provide context for the rabbit hole I’m going down. I should make it clear I’m not “worried” about this, I’m perfectly happy to enjoy my headphones and my music without wringing my hands worrying if I’m doing it properly. This is purely because I want to learn. I like learning. It’s that simple. And in service of that, I’d be interested to hear more detailed information on either side of this argument. Correct me where I’m wrong, elaborate where I’m oversimplifying, provide additional context I might not be considering. The folks here seem passionate and knowledgeable and I would be grateful if any of you would be willing to share your wisdom with me in the name of learning new things!",

Each has its own usecase, but I guess you get what I mean.\nI think that to me it mostly just makes me not wanna buy anything beyond the tier I’m currently at even though it can be pretty tempting to know what a really expensive pair can sound like and how much better sound can get, I just kinda know that even a 2,000$ pair would eventually just become normal!\nAm I making sense here?\n",

    "selftext": "I was tidying up on my drawers and found my IEM tips collection from AZLA to SpinFit, from SYMBIO to JVC Spiral Dot. Decided to test out on the AirPod 3 pro since this version has now a small nozzle and to my surprise, most of the tips work fine, especially the SpinFit CP240 Double-Flange as seen in the pics. The fit is great and the tip wraps nicely around the oval nozzle. Since the isolation increases drastically, the perceived ANC increased too. \n\n  \nHas anyone tried this out?",

    "selftext": "I have just gotten the Dunu Arashi. I would not believe that this was Dunu's first go at a full sized cans if I haven't known about it. The execution was *very refined*, and I am left with thoughts in my head about how heated this 1000 dollar segment of open back market truly is. \n\nThe balance of weight (500g) by a very reliable strap mechanism that just makes Hifiman's Arya straps feel flimsy really comes to me immediately. The attention to detail really stood out. Dunu's only real flaw here with their beautiful built XLR and quarter inch cables (3.5mm entry at that, with the dual entries angled to the back, a classy decision) is the length being a bit unwieldy as with \"audiophile\" phones of ere. Would have liked to see Dunu flex their IEM cable mastery even more by featuring modular cable termination. \n\nThe presentation is not as \"in-your-face\" as with the DK3001BD Braindance, although the sub-bass and the bass made me think that this is what I'd get if I stick that 30ohm impedance adapter to the Braindance to lift the midbass on that divisive set of IEMs (which I adore).  The soundstage width is quite good, but depth is only mediocre. Feels like Dunu purposely put them just a touch out of focus, as they easily come into focus on a gentle EQ to Kemar DF target. You won't be as floored as with say Arya Organic in the sheer soundstage, but these aren't as closed as say Focal.\n\nWhen compared to what I have on hand, I think that their timbre is very natural and refined. The Utopia OG in comparison is immensely capable even with their passionate presentation as they boast even more accented macrodynamic with the \"slam\". The Noire X feel subdued and much more 'clinical'. HD800S and HD700 possess immense soundstage and separation, but they might be fatiguing in comparison to these.\n\nI have tried them with Qudelix-5k even just from the unbalanced 3.5mm, and with BTR17, but scaling to full sized amp such as K17/K19 is still recommended). I think what you use for a serious IEM amp setup will work beautifully with the Arashi. Don't use bottom rung amp and dac as you'd feel that you've cheated yourself from what these cans can do. \n\nThe Arashi isn't out to offend, and they can really be driven by portable source.  You can be very happy even just listening to Spotify and YouTube uploaded music with these, as the timbre with the finesse of the bass here make for very easy listen. \n\nYeah. Do color me greatly impressed. The finely controlled subbass to bass is the absolute star of the show here. ",

    "title": "PSVANE Summit 6SN7 Tube Review",
    "selftext": "Alright, some of you might remember when I raved about the PSVANE Horizon tubes a while back. For the money, they were just fantastic, a real sweet spot of musicality and detail that honestly felt like a steal. So when I heard they were releasing a Summit series, I was both excited and skeptical. Let's be real, in the world of HiFi, \"better\" usually just means a lot more expensive. I had to know if they could actually top the Horizon series in a meaningful way.\nWell, after a few weeks with the Summit 6SN7, I can tell you this: they did!\n\nThe review again was done using mypreamp Schitt Freya+. The first 20-30 hours of burn in were a little bit of a ride. Initially, things felt a bit constrained, a little too polite. I was worried. But I left it running and came back the next day, and that's when it started to open up. The soundstage just bloomed. I put on \"No Time to Die\" by Billie Eilish, a track I've used for testing forever, and the texture of the instruments and background was staggering. It wasn't just detail for detail's sake, you could feel the room where it was recorded with Hans Zimmer orchestrating it.\n\nWhat really sold me, though, was the bass. My old VT231s have great bass, but the Summit brings a level of control and speed that's just different. It's taut and deep without ever feeling bloated. On tracks with complex electronic basslines, where other tubes can turn things into a bit of a muddy mess, the Summit keeps every layer clean and defined. There's no comparison to a stock EH or Ray tube in this department and it’s not even a fair fight.\n\nAfter having rolled so many 6SN7s over the years, NOS Sylvania VT231s, Ray tubes, Electro Harmonix, vintage chrome dome Sylvanias, and all the rest, the PSVANE Summit Series 6SN7 still manages to grab hold of your attention in a way that few modern tubes do. If you are chasing detail, transparency, and excellent bass control, this tube should be on your shortlist. It is not just good for what modern tubes do, it approximates the best tubes I have ever heard, including the Sylvania VT231 family.\n\nMicro detail in cymbal overtones, string nuances, and the trailing decay of piano notes all emerge with clarity. It does not shout look at me, but rather quietly reveals what is there in full fidelity. \n\nIt leans just a hair warm, but in a really tasteful way. It's not the kind of syrupy warmth that smothers detail. It’s more of a natural glow that takes the edge off harsh digital recordings without sacrificing the bite. It makes vocals, both male and female, sound incredibly rich and present.\n\nI ran the Summit through a few of my favorite solid-state amps to see how it would behave. It’s not an overly picky tube, but the character of the amp definitely plays a huge role in the final sound.\n• Aune S17 Pro EVO: This was probably the most straightforward and balanced pairing. The S17 has a massive reserve of clean, Class A power and a very neutral, detailed presentation. The Summit tube slotted in nicely, adding a welcome dose of warmth and dimensionality without taking away from the amp's technical strengths. It's a great all-arounder. The only critique I have is that it can feel a little... polite. \n• Pass Labs HPA-1: If you're a fan of rich, romantic, and velvety sound, this pairing might be for you, but it comes with a serious warning: this is where you can have too much of a good thing. The HPA-1 already has a smooth, warm character. Adding the Summit on top results in a sound that is incredibly lush and forgiving, but it sacrifices a significant amount of speed and bite. For slow jazz or vocals, it's gorgeous. But for anything fast-paced like rock or electronic music, the bass loses its tautness and the whole presentation can feel a bit sluggish and overly thick.\n• Holo Bliss + May KTE chain: Two words END GAME. This setup is an absolute microscope. It’s so incredibly resolving that it tells you everything about the gear you plug into it, for better or worse. On one hand, the Summit's strengths its rich harmonics and soundstage depth were on full display. It sounded huge and impressive. \n\nHeadphones \n• Sennheiser HD600: Oh, man. This is the one. If you own an HD600, this pairing is a must-hear. It takes everything the headphone is famous for that gorgeous, neutral midrange and injects a dose of emotion and space. It’s like the soundstage suddenly grew in all directions. Listening to Jeff Buckley's Grace, his voice was so nuanced and layered, it was almost haunting. It’s not just a change, it’s a transformation.\n• Sennheiser HD800S: The Summit is the perfect antidote for the HD800's occasional surgical nature. It doesn't kill the detail or the incredible imaging, but it melts away that analytical edge that can lead to fatigue. That slight treble peak? Tamed. The bass, which can feel a bit light on the HD800, now has real authority. It turns the HD800 from a studio tool into an instrument of pure immersion.\n• Audeze LCD-X (2021): The Summit gives it soul. I threw on some Rage Against the Machine, and the snares had this incredible skin texture, and synths had a satisfying throb. It adds that liquid, tubey goodness that planar fans often crave without sacrificing the speed and punch.\n• Hifiman HE1000SE: If you want your system to sound luxurious, this is it. The HE1000SE is already a technical marvel, but the Summit gives it a visceral, tactile quality. Strings feel like they're being played right in front of you. The whole presentation is just effortless and grand.\n• Hifiman Arya Organic: The Summit is a great match here, calming down the Arya's sometimes clinical presentation. It softens the edges just enough to make it more poetic and less like a microscope, filling out the mids and giving the sound a more three dimensional, immersive feel.\n\nOkay, it can't all be sunshine and roses, right? \nFirst, let's talk about the elephant in the room: the price. These are not cheap tubes. They command a significant premium over the Horizon series and most other new production 6SN7s. In relation to the Ray select, the Summit series is a bargain and honestly outright beats it in performance and price. While the performance jump is real, you start hitting the law of diminishing returns when compared to the Horizon series. The Summit is a clear step up, but it's not 3x the performance for 3x the price. For many, the Horizon will still be the smarter buy, offering 85% of the performance for a fraction of the cost. What would I choose since most will comment and ask, without a doubt the Summit series. It's simple bliss and believe it's a bargain at even the asking price. It's makes all the difference. \n\nFor me, it has earned a permanent spot in my system. It reminds me why I got into this crazy hobby in the first place.\n",

Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

The goal was just to prove the concept.\n\nThey’re also super light (25 grams), which is actually lighter than the cable itself 😄\n\nI’d love to hear what you think or answer any questions about the build!",

    "selftext": "So, I’ve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn’t stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it’s no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they’d be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they’re better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they’re still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I’m really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say “sufficient”) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an “active analog mode” which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you’re looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC… look no further!",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

Literally stood there with my mouth hanging open.\n\nThere were hundreds of headphones on display that day, but none of them came close to what the Grado delivered. The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are— 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it—do yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

    "title": "Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones Gen 2 Review",
    "selftext": "I’ve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say — these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural — vocals, instruments, bass — nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven’t noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it’s natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head — soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn’t use them for workouts (they’re not built for that kind of movement), but they’re fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal — so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you’re in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you’ve already paired — that’s super convenient. Battery life is great too — around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere’s also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I’ve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I’ve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They’re not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they’re absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

    "selftext": "So the last few weeks I’ve been hunting for my first pair of real headphones. I’ve been using Astro A50s for a while they’re great for gaming, but man, they get super uncomfortable after like an hour.\n\nI’m totally new to the audiophile world, and holy hell, there are so many options. I had no clue where to start, so of course I did what any sane person would do I went to Reddit. I got a few a different suggestions but as I was searching through all of them I ended up looking up the Meze 109 pros and immediately fell in love with the looks. The wood finish on the cups matches my setup perfectly.\n\nSo I take the plunge — $800 on the 109 Pros and another $200 on a Topping DX3 Pro+. Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and… they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn’t notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I’d just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I’d give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two — same story. Day three, same thing at first… until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I’d never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I’m just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I’m not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

They do seem to make them a bit less toasty (which was not a problem, but was noticeable with the stock pads for me). They also change the frequency response a bit, tilt it a bit to the high end, and open it up slightly. Not an improvement, for me, I like the warm, slightly more intimate feel of the stock pads a bit better, but not something that would stop me from using these either. Sound is still great. Edit: I had said that the sound isolation was not as good, but I am going back and forth now, and really, it is about the same. Also, going back and forth between the two, the sound difference really is minimal - it is there, but less then my initial impression. I don't hear much of a difference in bass either. I think the sound changes a little as the pads warm up, maybe the seal becomes a little better, and the differences, which are not much to begin with, decrease.\n\n Wondering what peoples impressions are, if anyone is still using these on their Maxwell? I am contemplating whether to keep them or not.",

    "selftext": "I've tried pretty much every \"spatial audio\" VST and DSP out there, and 99% of it is garbage. Just weird tricks that sound fake. Recently I learned about convolution. I found the ASH-IR-Dataset and just started messing with room impulse files. Then I tried one called Calypso, and that was the first time it actually felt like I was sitting in a room, not listening to a weird effect. The next game-changer was headphone correction. You have to EQ your headphones to a diffuse-field target first. It makes the headphones neutral for the simulation to work on.\n\nThat's when I found the ASH-Toolset. It took me literal days of tweaking to get a sound that wasn't just \"good\" but correct. You have to learn the settings because the defaults probably won't work for you. The most critical part is the HRTF dataset (the \"dummy head\" recordings). You have to test them all (KEMAR, KU 100, etc.) Your ears are physically unique. The HRTF that's perfect for me will sound weird and wrong to you. If you don't find the one that anatomically clicks with your brain, you will never get that true \"in front of you\" sound.\n\nFor the first time in my life, music is actually in front of me, originating from a point in space outside my head. I'm now listening to music I've ignored for years (acoustic, live concerts, old rock) and it's more engaging than the metal I've lived on for 5 years, because I can hear the actual space in the recording. The effect is insane on my IEMs, super precise and immersive. On my HD 650s, it's also incredible, but the sense of space is wider and less \"in your face,\" a totally different but equally cool vibe. If you're tired of the gimmicks and want to hear what's really possible, this is the way.\n\n(I don't know English well, so I apologize if something is written incorrectly.)\n\nupd: I wrote a short instruction on how to start using the dataset - [https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/)",

    "selftext": "First off, I am new to the headphone space so please excuse my lack of understanding.\n\nI have noticed that most reviewers, whether that's a review on YouTube, or an article on their website, place heavy emphasis on the frequency response curve. They will place this above all else when it comes to sound quality.\nFrom what I understand, frequency response curve is more indicative of a headphones 'sound signature' or what the manufacturer intended it to sound like but is not the only or imo main factor in the overall sound quality. \nFor example, when you compare a cheap pair of headphones to a more expensive one, no matter how well the cheap pair is tuned, it will still lack detail or resolution that the more expensive headphone will have (based on my experience). You might not hear the small variations in the artists vocals or the instruments. It can also lack clarity in the sound. \nSo, I feel, the frequency response curve is only one aspect of the overall sound quality, but there are many more things to consider and compare. You would expect an expensive pair of headphones to still sound 'better' even if it's not tuned closer to the Harman curve compared to a cheaper pair, just because of the better drivers, better materials and superior sound processing. \n\nIf so, why do reviews not talk about the rest of the factors affecting sound quality and focus almost purely on the sound signature, which to some extent can be fixed with an EQ, when the rest of it is not adjustable? \nSometimes they make it seem as if a well tuned $50 pair is better than a $400 pair which is better better build with better materials, with it's only shortcoming being a slightly worse tuning. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Or am I approaching this wrong?\nIs sound signature the defining factor in sound quality and listening experience or should we focus equally on things like clarity, resolution, ability to recreate the small variations in the sound, distortion?\nDo they avoid it because these other factors can't be quantified easily?

Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

The goal was just to prove the concept.\n\nThey’re also super light (25 grams), which is actually lighter than the cable itself 😄\n\nI’d love to hear what you think or answer any questions about the build!",

    "selftext": "So, I’ve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn’t stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it’s no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they’d be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they’re better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they’re still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I’m really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say “sufficient”) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an “active analog mode” which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you’re looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC… look no further!",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "selftext": "\nI still remember it like it was yesterday—walking into that audiophile shop in Paris and discovering the Grado 225e for the first time.\n\nI was blown away. Literally stood there with my mouth hanging open.\n\nThere were hundreds of headphones on display that day, but none of them came close to what the Grado delivered. The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are— 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it—do yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

    "title": "Steam Box in 2026 is the Xbox Killer.",
    "selftext": "I’ve been thinking lately, what if Valve released a Steam Box that could finally eliminate the need for an Xbox entirely?\n\nHear me out: Xbox used to make sense because it was the most accessible way to enjoy high-quality gaming on a TV without building a PC. But now, with Steam’s massive library, regular sales, mod support, and the Steam Deck ecosystem, why not go all-in and make a console-style device for the living room?\n\nWhat My Version of the Steam Box Would Be:\n\nFull Steam Library Access:\n\nNo subscriptions needed, no artificial storefront limits. Just boot up and your entire Steam library is already there.\n\nCloud Sync with Steam Deck:\n\nSeamless cross-play with the Steam Deck. Start a game in your living room, pick it up on your Steam Deck on the go, progress synced instantly via Steam Cloud.\n\nGraphically Stronger Than Xbox:\n\nWith modern desktop GPU architecture, it could easily outperform the Xbox Series X. Even a mid-tier GPU like the RTX 4070/7800XT level would destroy a console in raw performance. Imagine Cyberpunk 2077 maxed out with mods in console form.\n\nMod Support on Console this alone would crush Xbox. Skyrim with full modding on a console? Baldur’s Gate 3 with community patches? Day 1 support for PC mods right from Steam Workshop.\n\nSteamOS with Big Picture Mode 2.0 A UI built for a controller-first experience. Simple, quick, customizable. No ads on the dashboard like Xbox and PlayStation love doing now.\n\nGame Streaming Integration Built-in support for:\n\nRemote Play\nNvidia GeForce Now\nXbox Game Pass (Cloud)\nMoonlight/Sunshine One box to unify ALL game libraries.\n\nMedia and Smart Home Friendly Support YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, Plex, and maybe even a home server mode for those who want to run NAS/media setups. \n\nWhy Xbox Would Be Useless After This:\n\nXbox’s main selling points today are:\n\nGame Pass (which you can already access via cloud/PC)\nAffordable hardware\nFamiliar controller ecosystem\n\nA Steam Box would counter all of that:\n✔ Way more games\n✔ Cheaper games thanks to Steam sales\n✔ Cloud sync with Steam Deck\n✔ Better performance\n✔ Mods\n✔ PC freedom with console simplicity\n\nXbox would honestly become irrelevant, Game Pass alone wouldn’t be enough to compete.",

When the steam deck first came out, I was excited like the rest of you. I somehow convinced myself from making the purchase when it first got released back in 2022. I have a beast of a PC, why would I need one? If I am going to be out and have extra time, I can just get some reading done instead of gaming.\n\nWell, now I am a mom and I figured I would treat myself to the OLED. My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby. Back to a time without all the responsibilities I carry now, I could have endlessly enjoyed the steam deck. I missed out on three years of being able to potato on the couch after a hard day at work. Before you weep for me, do not worry. I fully plan to own a steam deck for the rest of my life to make up for it.\n\nTL;DR: Buy a steam deck, and live a happy life.",

Some people might think this is terrorism to the Steam Deck because SteamOS was built specifically for gaming and it's the perfect software and I agree with that, but I want to be able to play Game Pass games while I still can (I don't think I will pay 30 bucks a month once this month finishes) and Minecraft with friends without the need to tinker with solutions that may or may not work. Also have in mind that if I do install Windows on it, I will also use it as a normal PC, as I have a dock, mouse and keyboard and some may say, \"Why don't you use your other pc, (because i have one), to do all of this?\" Well because when i bought my pc, i had little to no idea of pc parts and i got tremendously scammed, overpaying more than 400 euros for a shit box that's worth 200.

Gotten quite far (chapter 5) but essentially I'm getting bored again it's just a massive fetch quest, with long cut scenes let's be honest. Although I am compelled to keep going. I'm not hating it but I'm some what addicted.\n\nSo again I'm sitting here with my steam deck holding forwards and walking through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape and my mind is wondering. I kinda want play a bit of street fighter 6. But I know if I stop playing Death Stranding there's a really big chance I might not come back to it for months. So I keep walking forwards, almost begrudgingly.\n\nThinking back to NMS, I can't remember what I was doing and what I planning to do next. If I boot that up again it might as well be someone else's save. So i probably need to start again. I was about 30 or 40 hours in. That would be the 3rd time I've started NMS again.\n\nThe list goes further back. Death Loop, Disco Elysium (started that around 4 times!), factorio, Dave the diver (I'm almost at the end and then I suddenly dropped it), dredge, elden ring, Kingdom come deliverance, jedi survivor. The last game I finished was Prey, which was excellent.\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue? What do you do? I wonder if it's worth keeping a game diary but honestly it seems like a lot of effort and kinda overkill for a casual endeavor. I don't have ADHD or anything...I don't think.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "A Mostly Comprehensive Guide to Setting Up EmuDeck Cross-Save between Steam Deck and Windows PC using Syncthing",
    "selftext": "Like me, you may have seen Syncthing mentioned as a free and convenient solution to sync up your EmuDeck saves on your SteamDeck with the same emulators on your PC, over the local network.\n\nAlso like me, you may have tried to set it up, searching Google and reddit for guidance, but only finding somewhat vague and outdated guides and comments that cross-reference each other and present a frustratingly unclear impression of what you actually need to do and why you need to do it.\n\nIf that's you, then this guide is for you. I wasted my whole weekend piecing together the Syncthing puzzle and other setup woes with my shiny new Steam Deck, and now I'm here to share what I learned so that you don't have to suffer like I did :\\^)\n\n**!!!

EmuDeck configures things to make the locations of things like save data folders more consistent, but it also means extra work to set up Syncthing properly.)\n* (If you set up your emulators without EmuDeck on either platform, most of this guide should still be applicable, though you'll be on your own in terms of figuring out the correct paths. If anything, it might be simpler, as the emulators will point you towards the correct paths for their save data and you won't have to worry about symlinks (explanation below).)\n* First, [install Syncthing Windows Setup or SyncTrayzor on your PC](https://syncthing.net/downloads/), and SyncThingy on your Steam Deck (via the Discover store in Desktop Mode).\n* With the Syncthing clients open on both machines, pair them by exchanging device IDs between PC and Steam Deck (see: [\"Getting Started\" Syncthing documentation](https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html)).\n   * Rather than going through the process of scanning the QR codes and/or sharing the device IDs somehow, you may be able to just select the respective devices from the nearby devices list (after confirming each device's respective ID first).\n\n# Create Shared Folders on the Steam Deck side of Syncthing\n\n* The [SyncThing guide on the EmuDeck Wiki](https://emudeck.github.io/community-creations/steamos/tools-and-guides/#how-to-set-up-syncthing) lists the appropriate Steam Deck paths and Ignore Patterns for several emulators.\n* In other cases, you can usually find the appropriate paths by launching the emulators themselves and looking for options to open the emulator or save file folder locations.\n   * (NOTE: if you set up EmuDeck on a microSD card instead of the Steam Deck's drive, replace any instances of \"mmcblk0p1\" with the name you set for the microSD card).\n   * The formatting provided in that guide is kind of confusing, but the (text) in the first line of each section WITHIN (but not including) \"path=(text)\" goes in the General > Folder Path field on Syncthing.\n   * The text BELOW (but not including) the \"Ignore Patterns:\" line should be pasted in the matching Ignore Patterns field.\n   * **However, in most cases you probably won't even need to set up the Ignore Patterns like that (see below).**\n* You may also want to sync other folders beyond just save data (BIOS/keys, game updates, metadata, etc.), but I will leave those decisions up to your discretion.\n\n# Ignore Patterns\n\n* The Ignore Patterns field in Syncthing creates a .stignore file in the directory, telling Syncthing what items in there should NOT be included when synced.\n* In most cases, you don't actually need to set up complex Ignore Patterns, as you can just isolate folders such that they should only ever contain relevant files to sync, such as within the save file folders themselves (see examples below).\n* Configuring specific Ignore Patterns is mostly convenient for when you can catch two or more relevant things in one directory (such as saves and states folders) while ignoring the rest of the stuff in there, saving you the hassle of having to make individual Shared Folders for each item.\n* **\"(?d).DS\\_Store\" excludes the hidden folder metadata file that is only applicable to that specific folder, and could cause issues if improperly synced.**\n   * \"A pattern beginning with a (?d) prefix enables removal of these files if they are preventing directory deletion. This prefix should be used by any OS generated files which you are happy to be removed.\"\n   * I'm not sure if it's explicitly necessary, but it seems like good practice and it's even mentioned in the Syncthing documentation examples, so I just include it in all of my Ignore Patterns.\n* Lines marked with \"//\" are comments (non-functional and just for descriptions).\n* Lines marked with \"!/\" marks items as \"do NOT exclude\" (or in other words, \"include\").\n* \"\\*\" excludes anything else in the folder not marked as \"do not exclude\".\n* **Syncthing lets you set a basic default ignore pattern for all new folders, so you don't have to waste your time copy-pasting the same thing over and over like I did.**\n* **(Per device/client) Syncthing > Actions > Settings > Edit Folder Defaults > Ignore Patterns > paste the following:**\n\n&#8203;\n\n    // INCLUDE\n    // items to force-include go below this (prefix with !)\n    \n    // IGNORE\n    // other items to exclude go below this\n    \n    (?d).DS_Store\n\n# Share the folders from the Steam Deck with the PC\n\n* In the Sharing menu of each Shared Folder on Steam Deck, select the PC that you paired to begin sharing/syncing that folder.\n* On your PC, accept the share request on Syncthing, then add the corresponding local folder path.\n* As mentioned above, you can typically find each equivalent folder on PC that contains an emulator's saves by opening the emulator and finding an option to open the saves folder for the emulator or for an individual game.\n* **There are important exceptions to this mentioned below.**\n* In most cases, you can add the same Ignore Patterns for each Shared Folder on PC as you did on Steam Deck.\n* You may find it more convenient to set up all of your Shared Folders on the Steam Deck or Windows first, and then go back to share them all in a row, rather than going back and forth to set up each pair.\n* For some emulator setups, the saves and states folders may be stored in separate locations on one platform, but together on the other. In these cases, they need to be split into separate Shared Folder syncs, but the path on the platform where they are stored together will be used twice. Syncthing will give you a small warning when you do this, but it should be fine as long as you set things up properly.\n* You may also encounter scenarios where the emulator's path names are different on Windows and Steam Deck for whatever reason, such as a \"savedata\" folder on one VS a \"saves\" folder on the other. This can cause the syncing to create a mega-folder that syncs the Steam Deck's folders into the PC directory and vice versa (so now both directories will have both the \"savedata\" and \"saves\" folders, and the saves will not be unified in one folder).\n* To deal with cases like this, you need to adjust your Saved Folder setups. Rather than trying to sync the folders containing the \"savedata\" or \"saves\" folders, set up the Shared Folders to go a layer deeper and sync the contents of those folders with each other instead (contents of \"savedata\" folder synced with the contents of \"saves\" folder).\n\n# Dealing with symlinks\n\n* **!!! IMPORTANT !!! On Windows, EmuDeck does some rearranging using \"symlinks\" as part of its setup for some emulators (ex. RetroArch, Dolphin, azahar). These symlinks can be identified by the folder icon having a box with an arrow in it tacked onto it.**\n* While the EmuDeck wiki tutorial mentions that it \"avoids symlinks\" as they are not compatible with Syncthing, it does not actually explain HOW to avoid dealing with said symlinks. This can be the source of frustrating and confusing errors in Syncthing, and caused me several hours of frustration.\n* **If an emulator points you to a save folder, and that save folder is actually a symlink (go 1 level above to the parent folder and look for the symlink icon), first try checking \"D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\[emulator\\]\\\\saves\" for the actual location of your save files.**\n* As for the full explanation, \"symlinks\", or \"symbolic links\", are special files that are treated as though they are in the location they are placed in, while actually pointing to a different location (like shortcuts, but at the file system level).\n* EmuDeck uses symlinks to clean up certain aspects of emulator configuration, such as storing save files from various emulators in a centralized location while still allowing the emulators to \"see\" them as if they were in their expected default locations. (Note: I think EmuDeck is technically using junctions, not symlinks, but whatever.)\n* However, since these symlinks are just pointers pointing to a different location where the files actually are, they are not compatible with Syncthing. You need to find the locations of the ACTUAL save file folders to input into Syncthing.\n* To do this, launch Command Prompt on Windows and do the following whenever a symlink is encountered.\n   * Input: cd \"\\[path where the symlink is located\\]\"\n   * Input: dir /al\n* This should identify any symlinks in the folder, and where they point to. When setting up the corresponding PC folder paths to match with the Steam Deck paths, use these \"real\" folder paths instead of the \"fake\" symlink paths. By default, most of the symlinks should point to somewhere like \"D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\[emulator\\]\\\\saves\".\n* **Similarly, if you are trying to sync a folder that includes any symlinks, you need to manually exclude all of the symlinks in the Ignore Patterns for that Shared Folder (ex. \"/saves\"), or else Syncthing will throw an error.**\n\n# Finishing setup\n\n* Syncthing does include sync conflict protection, but you may also want to enable File Versioning backups on the Shared Folders you set up (on the Steam Deck side, PC side, or both) if you want extra protection against sync error shenanigans.\n* Some additional/final troubleshooting steps are listed below.\n* Once you are finished doing all of that, you're finally done! You can now switch to Desktop Mode and launch SyncThingy whenever you want to sync data with your PC.\n   * Make sure that Syncthing is also running on your PC.\n   * Alternatively, you can try setting up Syncthing to run automatically in Gaming Mode, per the link above, though I personally didn't bother with this.\n\n# Fix Syncthing not being able to write to .var folder\n\n* (NOTE: To be honest, I'm not sure when exactly this becomes a problem, but multiple guides and comments mentioned it solving issues they were having, so I did it just in case.)\n* In Desktop Mode, install Flatseal via Discover.\n* Launch Flatseal, and scroll on the left sidebar until you find Syncthing/SyncThingy, and select it.\n* On the right, scroll down to \"Filesystem\".\n* Under \"Other files\", click the icon of a folder with a plus sign.\n* Type \"\\~/.var/app:rw\" (no quotes) in the field that appears.\n* Close Flatseal and restart the Steam Deck to apply changes.\n\n# (Obsolete?) Resolve port conflict between Syncthing and Decky\n\n* (NOTE: This may not be an issue in more recent builds of Syncthing, so first verify if you actually need to do anything before wasting your time like I did.)\n   * In Desktop Mode, open Syncthing and access the Web GUI.\n   * Actions > Settings > GUI > GUI Listen Address\n   * If the GUI Listen Address already ends in 8384 (or anything other than 8080 I guess?), then you don't have to do anything.\n   * Else if the GUI Listen Address ends in 8080, proceed as follows.\n* Switch to Gaming Mode > Settings > Developer (Enable Developer Mode in System settings if you haven't already)\n* UNCHECK: CEF Remote Debugging\n* Switch to Desktop Mode and open Syncthing GTK to access the Web GUI.\n* Actions > Settings > GUI > GUI Listen Address\n* Change the port on \"GUI Listen Address\" from 8080 to 8384 (i.e. \"0.0.0.0:8080\" becomes \"0.0.0.0:8384\").\n* Switch back to Gaming Mode and re-enable CEF Remote Debugging.\n* Switch back to Desktop Mode and re-install Decky.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you've made it this far, then hopefully everything should be working, and you can now enjoy convenient cross-save and syncing between your Steam Deck and PC over your local network. Yay!\n\nI know the post was exceedingly long, but I hope it was worth the effort of trying to clarify each step of the process. Please let me know if there are any mistakes or important points that I missed!\n\nI'll close out the post with some examples of the Shared Folders that I set up for myself.\n\n# Emulation - Extra Files (BIOS, Keys, ETC)\n\n* (extraFiles is a folder I made to tuck away things like BIOS, system firmware, etc.)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\extraFiles\n* Steam Deck path: /run/media/deck/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/extraFiles\n\n# Emulation - Game Metadata/Media\n\n* (This is the folder that Emulation Station dumps its scraped game metadata in)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\storage\\\\downloaded\\_media\n* Steam Deck path: /run/media/deck/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/storage/downloaded\\_media/\n\n# azahar\n\n* (saves and states are in different paths on Steam Deck)\n* Windows path (Saves): D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\azahar\\\\saves\n* Windows path (States): D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\azahar\\\\states\n* Steam Deck path (Saves): /run/media/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/storage/azahar/sdmc\n* Steam Deck path (States): /home/deck/.local/share/azahar-emu/states\n\n# Dolphin\n\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\dolphin\n* Steam Deck path: /home/deck/.var/app/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu/data/dolphin-emu\n\n# RetroArch\n\n* (The Steam Deck directory contains more stuff, so you need to set Ignore Patterns to only include the saves and states folders)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\retroarch\n* Steam Deck: /home/deck/.var/app/org.libretro.RetroArch/config/retroarch\n\n# Ignore Patterns\n\n    // INCLUDE\n    !/saves\n    !/states\n    // IGNORE\n    *\n    (?d).DS_Store",

I can play all my other RPG single players fine but (i assume because of the mod store) i haven't been able to run elder scrolls whatsoever. Just trying to find a work around, tsa! ",

I’ve watched a lot of videos about plugins like Decky FrameGen and Lossless Scaling, and I’ve tried to set everything up properly — I even bought Lossless Scaling.\n\nBut I’ve run into a big problem.\nMost of the tutorial videos show how to add the launch command directly in Steam, but I’m trying to play Cyberpunk 2077 from my GOG account, so I’m launching it through Heroic Games Launcher, then addes as a non Steam game, and i play It from there.  In Steam, the launch options already include another command, and if I remove it, the game won’t start.\n\nSo, I went into Heroic and added this as a wrapper command:\n/home/deck/fgmod/fgmod\nThen I gave Heroic access to the path through Flatseal. Everything seems to work fine so far — I can select FSR 4 directly in the game’s graphics settings (though I’m not sure it’s really doing anything).\n\nFor Lossless Scaling, I added another wrapper:\n/home/deck/lsfg\n(If I add %command% at the end, the game won’t launch.)\nI also gave Heroic permission to access the path in Flatseal.\n\nNow, the game launches fine, and when I open the Lossless Scaling plugin from Decky Loader, it correctly detects that Cyberpunk 2077 is running.\nHowever, when I change settings (like switching between 2x, 4x, etc.), it doesn’t seem to have any visible effect — no stutter, no difference at all.\n\nDoes anyone know what I might be doing wrong or how to tell if it’s actually working?\n\nEdit: I have also tried to add the cyberpunk.exe to non Steam games, so i thought i could turn around the problem, but It wont even boot up.",

But I’ve heard the performance for these kinds of games is pretty rough on Deck right now.\n\nFor context, I have both a PS5 and a Steam Deck, but I usually lean toward getting games on Deck since I like being able to play anywhere and mess around with mods for replayability. That said, I’m not sure if it’s worth waiting for patches or optimizations, or if I should just grab them on PS5 and accept that Deck versions might never improve much.\n\nBasically: in your experience, do games like these (big, demanding titles) tend to get better over time on Deck? Or once they’re rough at launch, are they usually stuck that way?",

Anyways, the Steam Deck is an amazing platform to dip my hands into the world of pc gaming myself, while still feeling (to me) like a PS1 meets a Wii U. Digital gaming is a bit of a foreign world to me still, but I'm getting adjusted to it. I am disabled as well, and the form factor is really easy for me to play on. I'll keep this part relatively short, mainly because my left hand is cramping up, but if you all have any questions, feel free to ask, I'll try to answer the best that I can. Thanks",

With that being said the thought of a guild comes to mind. I'm usually a console type of guy but really enjoy my steam deck and WoW. I'm also a husband and father. Which brings me to the point of not being able to afford a gaming PC right now. I say this to say I'm nervous/timid about reaching out to a guild to join seeing as how I only play on steam deck and can't really create my own guild as I have no other friends who play WoW, they're all console gamers or those couple I have that have a steam deck aren't into WoW. Just looking for some advice here. Anyone have a guild that's open to a strictly steam deck player or any interested in creating a steam deck WoW guild haha. But seriously any advice/direction is much appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "I bought a JSAUX Steam Deck Dock on sale, pretty cheap, because I wanted to give gaming on a docked Deck a try, on my 4K 50 inch TV. I can honestly say it works perfectly and I've had absolutely zero problems so far. However I've heard a couple of horror stories about the JSAUX Dock, which I'm hoping to not encounter with this lastest interation. \n\nApparently the Type C cable, build quality and HDMI port were quite poor on previous iterations of this device, but this latest version has been running flawless for me so far.\n\nThis latest version is the JSAUX Upgraded Steam Deck Dock, 5-in-1 Docking Station, with HDMI 4K@120Hz, 100Mbps. Getting this thing to actually display in 4k is a bit awkward though and required me to enter Desktop Mode to set a custom resolution. However, games look perfectly fine in their native resolution and being displayed on the screen regardless, running at a perfect 60fps on games like Megabonk, and the fact I sit a good distance away from the TV helps. I'm using a wired Xbox One controller plugged into one of the rear USB ports currently, but will be using a wireless PS5 controller via Bluetooth soon.\n\nThe Dock is something I'll use occasionally. It's nice to have and a decent little tool if I ever feel like gaming on the TV. What are you thoughts on Steam Deck Docks? Anyone else running with one?",

    "selftext": "So I was playing no Man Sky. I was enjoying it but I was getting a little bored. That's when I got distracted by my backlog so I stayed playing Death Stranding. Gotten quite far (chapter 5) but essentially I'm getting bored again it's just a massive fetch quest, with long cut scenes let's be honest. Although I am compelled to keep going. I'm not hating it but I'm some what addicted.\n\nSo again I'm sitting here with my steam deck holding forwards and walking through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape and my mind is wondering. I kinda want play a bit of street fighter 6. But I know if I stop playing Death Stranding there's a really big chance I might not come back to it for months. So I keep walking forwards, almost begrudgingly.\n\nThinking back to NMS, I can't remember what I was doing and what I planning to do next. If I boot that up again it might as well be someone else's save. So i probably need to start again. I was about 30 or 40 hours in. That would be the 3rd time I've started NMS again.\n\nThe list goes further back. Death Loop, Disco Elysium (started that around 4 times!), factorio, Dave the diver (I'm almost at the end and then I suddenly dropped it), dredge, elden ring, Kingdom come deliverance, jedi survivor. The last game I finished was Prey, which was excellent.\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue? What do you do? I wonder if it's worth keeping a game diary but honestly it seems like a lot of effort and kinda overkill for a casual endeavor. I don't have ADHD or anything...I don't think.\n\n\n\n",

I have a beast of a PC, why would I need one? If I am going to be out and have extra time, I can just get some reading done instead of gaming.\n\nWell, now I am a mom and I figured I would treat myself to the OLED. My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby. Back to a time without all the responsibilities I carry now, I could have endlessly enjoyed the steam deck. I missed out on three years of being able to potato on the couch after a hard day at work.

    "title": "What I'm trying to play as I die: A somewhat update!",
    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI hope you are all well and enjoying your decks! \n\nI wasn't too sure if I should do this update, I have been getting much weaker as the weeks and days go by and gaming of any kind has become almost impossible it feels. I struggle to play more than an hour but I do try! I am finding myself losing weight faster than ever before, my strength has all but gone, and I struggle greatly with nausea so much even as I try to write this I am having to take breaks, so just please understand that ALL I want to do is chat and play with all of you, I would love to do nothing more but its becoming harder and harder. \n\nEven then we still GAME ON! I have been bedridden so much that watching movies and tv shows is something I can do much easier, so maybe you could drop your fave tv shows and films as well as games!\n\nand lastly before the review, I wondered if it would be worthwhile creating a discord server, where anyone who's bothered could come by and chat, hang out, etc. If you think it could be a good idea, let me know!\n\nDying Light: The Beast - WOW! When I first remember playing Dying Light 1, I was truly blown away, it felt like what I always wanted Dead Island to be, this ultra realistic zombie game, and it just delivered on every level, it made zombies SCARY again, you can't fight hordes, 3 or 4 is a decent battle, the night was scary and the Stalkers! wow. Then came 2, and whilst it developed on every element from the first game, it somehow, mistreated them. \n\nNight was no longer scary, the traversal didn't feel as fun, and it just felt TOO BIG, a bit BLOATED, and I didn't care like I did in 1. So, when Dying Light - The Beast was announced, I actually wasn't too excited, but once it launched all I heard was good things, now I have only played around 4 hours  but those were some of the most exciting, thrilling and scary hours of gaming in a LONG time. The graphics are sublime, the gore, the combat, traversal, it is all for me..perfect in every single way. If you loved 1, then this will be your perfect new zombie game, if you felt let down by 2, this is the game to revitalise that love of killing zombies. \n\nSilent Hill f - Whilst I have only started, it is only my second foray into the Silent Hill world. Now I LOVE Halloween, and I find dev's filmmakers, anyone really when it comes to Horror, they kinda throw in a few jump scares and say \"It's a scary game\" so I love when a game is fully fleshed out, the in's and out's, the themes, the pure scariness! Well, I have pretty much switched Silent Hill f straight off, like right click and close window, because it's CREEPY. The sound design is incredible, and just makes the entire world far more scary. I am still only just pulling back the cover but I am loving it!\n\nI HOPE to be somewhat better soon where I can at least play some games, or just feel like I can exist for a few hours. I always want to be honest with all of you, and the fact is depression is something I have fought with help from my family, but the last few weeks, I have just felt lower, and lower. Everyday is harder, and I am struggling more than ever. I have support, I have people, but there's an finality setting in, an understanding that my mum can't just be a MUM and fix this, I think maybe it is all catching up to me. \n\nThank you once again for taking your time to read this and being apart of this journey, I apologise for the gap between these posts but I am just shedding weight, I look in the mirror and I don't know who I see, for the first time I looked at myself and truly admitted. \"I am sick, this is it\". It has been tough, but whenever I have felt down either Reddit or Steam will ping and someone will be checking in, someone will be seeing how I am, and that..that really keeps me going. So each and everyone of you mean the world to me. \n\n  \nI hope more than anything to continue my silly updates, we have a new Football manager coming out, Outer worlds 2! Vampire: Masquerade 2! and that just a few amazing experiences that I hold on to, seeing my family everyday, speaking with you all, and looking forward to games, that's a core of my push each day and it works so far :')\n\nOnce again, thank you for taking time to read this, and I hope to hear from you all. \n\nAdd me on Steam anytime! 82871772\n\nAnd if you fancy joining my Discord server, so we have somewhere to chat - https://discord.gg/TjRhH2Ye\n\nM",

But I’ve heard the performance for these kinds of games is pretty rough on Deck right now.\n\nFor context, I have both a PS5 and a Steam Deck, but I usually lean toward getting games on Deck since I like being able to play anywhere and mess around with mods for replayability. That said, I’m not sure if it’s worth waiting for patches or optimizations, or if I should just grab them on PS5 and accept that Deck versions might never improve much.\n\nBasically: in your experience, do games like these (big, demanding titles) tend to get better over time on Deck? Or once they’re rough at launch, are they usually stuck that way?",

I wasted my whole weekend piecing together the Syncthing puzzle and other setup woes with my shiny new Steam Deck, and now I'm here to share what I learned so that you don't have to suffer like I did :\\^)\n\n**!!!

EmuDeck configures things to make the locations of things like save data folders more consistent, but it also means extra work to set up Syncthing properly.)\n* (If you set up your emulators without EmuDeck on either platform, most of this guide should still be applicable, though you'll be on your own in terms of figuring out the correct paths. If anything, it might be simpler, as the emulators will point you towards the correct paths for their save data and you won't have to worry about symlinks (explanation below).)\n* First, [install Syncthing Windows Setup or SyncTrayzor on your PC](https://syncthing.net/downloads/), and SyncThingy on your Steam Deck (via the Discover store in Desktop Mode).\n* With the Syncthing clients open on both machines, pair them by exchanging device IDs between PC and Steam Deck (see: [\"Getting Started\" Syncthing documentation](https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html)).\n   * Rather than going through the process of scanning the QR codes and/or sharing the device IDs somehow, you may be able to just select the respective devices from the nearby devices list (after confirming each device's respective ID first).\n\n# Create Shared Folders on the Steam Deck side of Syncthing\n\n* The [SyncThing guide on the EmuDeck Wiki](https://emudeck.github.io/community-creations/steamos/tools-and-guides/#how-to-set-up-syncthing) lists the appropriate Steam Deck paths and Ignore Patterns for several emulators.\n* In other cases, you can usually find the appropriate paths by launching the emulators themselves and looking for options to open the emulator or save file folder locations.\n   * (NOTE: if you set up EmuDeck on a microSD card instead of the Steam Deck's drive, replace any instances of \"mmcblk0p1\" with the name you set for the microSD card).\n   * The formatting provided in that guide is kind of confusing, but the (text) in the first line of each section WITHIN (but not including) \"path=(text)\" goes in the General > Folder Path field on Syncthing.\n   * The text BELOW (but not including) the \"Ignore Patterns:\" line should be pasted in the matching Ignore Patterns field.\n   * **However, in most cases you probably won't even need to set up the Ignore Patterns like that (see below).**\n* You may also want to sync other folders beyond just save data (BIOS/keys, game updates, metadata, etc.), but I will leave those decisions up to your discretion.\n\n# Ignore Patterns\n\n* The Ignore Patterns field in Syncthing creates a .stignore file in the directory, telling Syncthing what items in there should NOT be included when synced.\n* In most cases, you don't actually need to set up complex Ignore Patterns, as you can just isolate folders such that they should only ever contain relevant files to sync, such as within the save file folders themselves (see examples below).\n* Configuring specific Ignore Patterns is mostly convenient for when you can catch two or more relevant things in one directory (such as saves and states folders) while ignoring the rest of the stuff in there, saving you the hassle of having to make individual Shared Folders for each item.\n* **\"(?d).DS\\_Store\" excludes the hidden folder metadata file that is only applicable to that specific folder, and could cause issues if improperly synced.**\n   * \"A pattern beginning with a (?d) prefix enables removal of these files if they are preventing directory deletion. This prefix should be used by any OS generated files which you are happy to be removed.\"\n   * I'm not sure if it's explicitly necessary, but it seems like good practice and it's even mentioned in the Syncthing documentation examples, so I just include it in all of my Ignore Patterns.\n* Lines marked with \"//\" are comments (non-functional and just for descriptions).\n* Lines marked with \"!/\" marks items as \"do NOT exclude\" (or in other words, \"include\").\n* \"\\*\" excludes anything else in the folder not marked as \"do not exclude\".\n* **Syncthing lets you set a basic default ignore pattern for all new folders, so you don't have to waste your time copy-pasting the same thing over and over like I did.**\n* **(Per device/client) Syncthing > Actions > Settings > Edit Folder Defaults > Ignore Patterns > paste the following:**\n\n&#8203;\n\n    // INCLUDE\n    // items to force-include go below this (prefix with !)\n    \n    // IGNORE\n    // other items to exclude go below this\n    \n    (?d).DS_Store\n\n# Share the folders from the Steam Deck with the PC\n\n* In the Sharing menu of each Shared Folder on Steam Deck, select the PC that you paired to begin sharing/syncing that folder.\n* On your PC, accept the share request on Syncthing, then add the corresponding local folder path.\n* As mentioned above, you can typically find each equivalent folder on PC that contains an emulator's saves by opening the emulator and finding an option to open the saves folder for the emulator or for an individual game.\n* **There are important exceptions to this mentioned below.**\n* In most cases, you can add the same Ignore Patterns for each Shared Folder on PC as you did on Steam Deck.\n* You may find it more convenient to set up all of your Shared Folders on the Steam Deck or Windows first, and then go back to share them all in a row, rather than going back and forth to set up each pair.\n* For some emulator setups, the saves and states folders may be stored in separate locations on one platform, but together on the other. In these cases, they need to be split into separate Shared Folder syncs, but the path on the platform where they are stored together will be used twice. Syncthing will give you a small warning when you do this, but it should be fine as long as you set things up properly.\n* You may also encounter scenarios where the emulator's path names are different on Windows and Steam Deck for whatever reason, such as a \"savedata\" folder on one VS a \"saves\" folder on the other. This can cause the syncing to create a mega-folder that syncs the Steam Deck's folders into the PC directory and vice versa (so now both directories will have both the \"savedata\" and \"saves\" folders, and the saves will not be unified in one folder).\n* To deal with cases like this, you need to adjust your Saved Folder setups. Rather than trying to sync the folders containing the \"savedata\" or \"saves\" folders, set up the Shared Folders to go a layer deeper and sync the contents of those folders with each other instead (contents of \"savedata\" folder synced with the contents of \"saves\" folder).\n\n# Dealing with symlinks\n\n* **!!! IMPORTANT !!! On Windows, EmuDeck does some rearranging using \"symlinks\" as part of its setup for some emulators (ex. RetroArch, Dolphin, azahar). These symlinks can be identified by the folder icon having a box with an arrow in it tacked onto it.**\n* While the EmuDeck wiki tutorial mentions that it \"avoids symlinks\" as they are not compatible with Syncthing, it does not actually explain HOW to avoid dealing with said symlinks. This can be the source of frustrating and confusing errors in Syncthing, and caused me several hours of frustration.\n* **If an emulator points you to a save folder, and that save folder is actually a symlink (go 1 level above to the parent folder and look for the symlink icon), first try checking \"D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\[emulator\\]\\\\saves\" for the actual location of your save files.**\n* As for the full explanation, \"symlinks\", or \"symbolic links\", are special files that are treated as though they are in the location they are placed in, while actually pointing to a different location (like shortcuts, but at the file system level).\n* EmuDeck uses symlinks to clean up certain aspects of emulator configuration, such as storing save files from various emulators in a centralized location while still allowing the emulators to \"see\" them as if they were in their expected default locations. (Note: I think EmuDeck is technically using junctions, not symlinks, but whatever.)\n* However, since these symlinks are just pointers pointing to a different location where the files actually are, they are not compatible with Syncthing. You need to find the locations of the ACTUAL save file folders to input into Syncthing.\n* To do this, launch Command Prompt on Windows and do the following whenever a symlink is encountered.\n   * Input: cd \"\\[path where the symlink is located\\]\"\n   * Input: dir /al\n* This should identify any symlinks in the folder, and where they point to. When setting up the corresponding PC folder paths to match with the Steam Deck paths, use these \"real\" folder paths instead of the \"fake\" symlink paths. By default, most of the symlinks should point to somewhere like \"D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\[emulator\\]\\\\saves\".\n* **Similarly, if you are trying to sync a folder that includes any symlinks, you need to manually exclude all of the symlinks in the Ignore Patterns for that Shared Folder (ex. \"/saves\"), or else Syncthing will throw an error.**\n\n# Finishing setup\n\n* Syncthing does include sync conflict protection, but you may also want to enable File Versioning backups on the Shared Folders you set up (on the Steam Deck side, PC side, or both) if you want extra protection against sync error shenanigans.\n* Some additional/final troubleshooting steps are listed below.\n* Once you are finished doing all of that, you're finally done! You can now switch to Desktop Mode and launch SyncThingy whenever you want to sync data with your PC.\n   * Make sure that Syncthing is also running on your PC.\n   * Alternatively, you can try setting up Syncthing to run automatically in Gaming Mode, per the link above, though I personally didn't bother with this.\n\n# Fix Syncthing not being able to write to .var folder\n\n* (NOTE: To be honest, I'm not sure when exactly this becomes a problem, but multiple guides and comments mentioned it solving issues they were having, so I did it just in case.)\n* In Desktop Mode, install Flatseal via Discover.\n* Launch Flatseal, and scroll on the left sidebar until you find Syncthing/SyncThingy, and select it.\n* On the right, scroll down to \"Filesystem\".\n* Under \"Other files\", click the icon of a folder with a plus sign.\n* Type \"\\~/.var/app:rw\" (no quotes) in the field that appears.\n* Close Flatseal and restart the Steam Deck to apply changes.\n\n# (Obsolete?) Resolve port conflict between Syncthing and Decky\n\n* (NOTE: This may not be an issue in more recent builds of Syncthing, so first verify if you actually need to do anything before wasting your time like I did.)\n   * In Desktop Mode, open Syncthing and access the Web GUI.\n   * Actions > Settings > GUI > GUI Listen Address\n   * If the GUI Listen Address already ends in 8384 (or anything other than 8080 I guess?), then you don't have to do anything.\n   * Else if the GUI Listen Address ends in 8080, proceed as follows.\n* Switch to Gaming Mode > Settings > Developer (Enable Developer Mode in System settings if you haven't already)\n* UNCHECK: CEF Remote Debugging\n* Switch to Desktop Mode and open Syncthing GTK to access the Web GUI.\n* Actions > Settings > GUI > GUI Listen Address\n* Change the port on \"GUI Listen Address\" from 8080 to 8384 (i.e. \"0.0.0.0:8080\" becomes \"0.0.0.0:8384\").\n* Switch back to Gaming Mode and re-enable CEF Remote Debugging.\n* Switch back to Desktop Mode and re-install Decky.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you've made it this far, then hopefully everything should be working, and you can now enjoy convenient cross-save and syncing between your Steam Deck and PC over your local network. Yay!\n\nI know the post was exceedingly long, but I hope it was worth the effort of trying to clarify each step of the process. Please let me know if there are any mistakes or important points that I missed!\n\nI'll close out the post with some examples of the Shared Folders that I set up for myself.\n\n# Emulation - Extra Files (BIOS, Keys, ETC)\n\n* (extraFiles is a folder I made to tuck away things like BIOS, system firmware, etc.)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\extraFiles\n* Steam Deck path: /run/media/deck/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/extraFiles\n\n# Emulation - Game Metadata/Media\n\n* (This is the folder that Emulation Station dumps its scraped game metadata in)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\storage\\\\downloaded\\_media\n* Steam Deck path: /run/media/deck/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/storage/downloaded\\_media/\n\n# azahar\n\n* (saves and states are in different paths on Steam Deck)\n* Windows path (Saves): D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\azahar\\\\saves\n* Windows path (States): D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\azahar\\\\states\n* Steam Deck path (Saves): /run/media/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/storage/azahar/sdmc\n* Steam Deck path (States): /home/deck/.local/share/azahar-emu/states\n\n# Dolphin\n\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\dolphin\n* Steam Deck path: /home/deck/.var/app/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu/data/dolphin-emu\n\n# RetroArch\n\n* (The Steam Deck directory contains more stuff, so you need to set Ignore Patterns to only include the saves and states folders)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\retroarch\n* Steam Deck: /home/deck/.var/app/org.libretro.RetroArch/config/retroarch\n\n# Ignore Patterns\n\n    // INCLUDE\n    !/saves\n    !/states\n    // IGNORE\n    *\n    (?d).DS_Store",

My only minor complaint is that the right bumper is a little mushy when pushing it down on its far side, but it still works perfectly when pushed from the top. Quick Google search suggests that this is unfortunately a common issue. Battery health looks to be solid at 97%.\n\nI'm new to PC gaming, so I don't have a Steam library yet, but thinking that this could supplement my Switch 2, especially for indies or more obscure titles. \n\nI'm going to pick up Return of Obra Dinn (on sale now), and looking forward to Master Chief Collection (waiting on a sale), Red Dead Redemption 2, and Baldurs Gate 3. Going to give Geforce Now a try at some point as well but hopefully my home internet is capable. \n\nEager to hear from owners of both the Switch 2 + Steam Deck. There's a lot of overlap in the libraries - what are your must have games that aren't available on the Switch? Also, would appreciate hearing your advice on whether I should apply a screen protector on top of the etched glass/anti-glare screen.\n\nCheers!",

Gotten quite far (chapter 5) but essentially I'm getting bored again it's just a massive fetch quest, with long cut scenes let's be honest. Although I am compelled to keep going. I'm not hating it but I'm some what addicted.\n\nSo again I'm sitting here with my steam deck holding forwards and walking through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape and my mind is wondering. I kinda want play a bit of street fighter 6. But I know if I stop playing Death Stranding there's a really big chance I might not come back to it for months. So I keep walking forwards, almost begrudgingly.\n\nThinking back to NMS, I can't remember what I was doing and what I planning to do next. If I boot that up again it might as well be someone else's save. So i probably need to start again. I was about 30 or 40 hours in. That would be the 3rd time I've started NMS again.\n\nThe list goes further back. Death Loop, Disco Elysium (started that around 4 times!), factorio, Dave the diver (I'm almost at the end and then I suddenly dropped it), dredge, elden ring, Kingdom come deliverance, jedi survivor. The last game I finished was Prey, which was excellent.\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue? What do you do? I wonder if it's worth keeping a game diary but honestly it seems like a lot of effort and kinda overkill for a casual endeavor. I don't have ADHD or anything...I don't think.\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Do not waste precious time. Life is short enough as it is. Buy a steam deck.\n\nI have always been an avid gamer all throughout my life. When the steam deck first came out, I was excited like the rest of you. I somehow convinced myself from making the purchase when it first got released back in 2022. I have a beast of a PC, why would I need one? If I am going to be out and have extra time, I can just get some reading done instead of gaming.\n\nWell, now I am a mom and I figured I would treat myself to the OLED. My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby. Back to a time without all the responsibilities I carry now, I could have endlessly enjoyed the steam deck. I missed out on three years of being able to potato on the couch after a hard day at work. Before you weep for me, do not worry. I fully plan to own a steam deck for the rest of my life to make up for it.\n\nTL;DR: Buy a steam deck, and live a happy life.",

    "title": "What I'm trying to play as I die: A somewhat update!",
    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI hope you are all well and enjoying your decks! \n\nI wasn't too sure if I should do this update, I have been getting much weaker as the weeks and days go by and gaming of any kind has become almost impossible it feels. I struggle to play more than an hour but I do try! I am finding myself losing weight faster than ever before, my strength has all but gone, and I struggle greatly with nausea so much even as I try to write this I am having to take breaks, so just please understand that ALL I want to do is chat and play with all of you, I would love to do nothing more but its becoming harder and harder. \n\nEven then we still GAME ON! I have been bedridden so much that watching movies and tv shows is something I can do much easier, so maybe you could drop your fave tv shows and films as well as games!\n\nand lastly before the review, I wondered if it would be worthwhile creating a discord server, where anyone who's bothered could come by and chat, hang out, etc. If you think it could be a good idea, let me know!\n\nDying Light: The Beast - WOW! When I first remember playing Dying Light 1, I was truly blown away, it felt like what I always wanted Dead Island to be, this ultra realistic zombie game, and it just delivered on every level, it made zombies SCARY again, you can't fight hordes, 3 or 4 is a decent battle, the night was scary and the Stalkers! wow. Then came 2, and whilst it developed on every element from the first game, it somehow, mistreated them. \n\nNight was no longer scary, the traversal didn't feel as fun, and it just felt TOO BIG, a bit BLOATED, and I didn't care like I did in 1. So, when Dying Light - The Beast was announced, I actually wasn't too excited, but once it launched all I heard was good things, now I have only played around 4 hours  but those were some of the most exciting, thrilling and scary hours of gaming in a LONG time. The graphics are sublime, the gore, the combat, traversal, it is all for me..perfect in every single way. If you loved 1, then this will be your perfect new zombie game, if you felt let down by 2, this is the game to revitalise that love of killing zombies. \n\nSilent Hill f - Whilst I have only started, it is only my second foray into the Silent Hill world. Now I LOVE Halloween, and I find dev's filmmakers, anyone really when it comes to Horror, they kinda throw in a few jump scares and say \"It's a scary game\" so I love when a game is fully fleshed out, the in's and out's, the themes, the pure scariness! Well, I have pretty much switched Silent Hill f straight off, like right click and close window, because it's CREEPY. The sound design is incredible, and just makes the entire world far more scary. I am still only just pulling back the cover but I am loving it!\n\nI HOPE to be somewhat better soon where I can at least play some games, or just feel like I can exist for a few hours. I always want to be honest with all of you, and the fact is depression is something I have fought with help from my family, but the last few weeks, I have just felt lower, and lower. Everyday is harder, and I am struggling more than ever. I have support, I have people, but there's an finality setting in, an understanding that my mum can't just be a MUM and fix this, I think maybe it is all catching up to me. \n\nThank you once again for taking your time to read this and being apart of this journey, I apologise for the gap between these posts but I am just shedding weight, I look in the mirror and I don't know who I see, for the first time I looked at myself and truly admitted. \"I am sick, this is it\". It has been tough, but whenever I have felt down either Reddit or Steam will ping and someone will be checking in, someone will be seeing how I am, and that..that really keeps me going. So each and everyone of you mean the world to me. \n\n  \nI hope more than anything to continue my silly updates, we have a new Football manager coming out, Outer worlds 2! Vampire: Masquerade 2! and that just a few amazing experiences that I hold on to, seeing my family everyday, speaking with you all, and looking forward to games, that's a core of my push each day and it works so far :')\n\nOnce again, thank you for taking time to read this, and I hope to hear from you all. \n\nAdd me on Steam anytime! 82871772\n\nAnd if you fancy joining my Discord server, so we have somewhere to chat - https://discord.gg/TjRhH2Ye\n\nM",

It has been there through sickness, injury recovery, boredom, etc.  I’ve got hundreds of hours of gaming on it, and look forward to hundreds more.  I’ve picked up 106 games for it since I took it out of the box, and currently have 89 games installed on it.  (Essentially every game I haven’t finished yet.)  I’ve still got over 220GB available in case anything else pops up that I can’t live without.  I hope everybody else gets as much enjoyment from theirs as I get from mine.

    "selftext": "So I’ve been wondering about something — is it common for unplayable or poorly performing games on the Steam Deck to eventually run well after patches or updates?\n\nFor example, I’ve always wanted to play Dragon’s Dogma 2, Rise of the Ronin, and now Wuchang: Fallen Feathers on Steam Deck. But I’ve heard the performance for these kinds of games is pretty rough on Deck right now.\n\nFor context, I have both a PS5 and a Steam Deck, but I usually lean toward getting games on Deck since I like being able to play anywhere and mess around with mods for replayability. That said, I’m not sure if it’s worth waiting for patches or optimizations, or if I should just grab them on PS5 and accept that Deck versions might never improve much.\n\nBasically: in your experience, do games like these (big, demanding titles) tend to get better over time on Deck? Or once they’re rough at launch, are they usually stuck that way?",

EmuDeck configures things to make the locations of things like save data folders more consistent, but it also means extra work to set up Syncthing properly.)\n* (If you set up your emulators without EmuDeck on either platform, most of this guide should still be applicable, though you'll be on your own in terms of figuring out the correct paths. If anything, it might be simpler, as the emulators will point you towards the correct paths for their save data and you won't have to worry about symlinks (explanation below).)\n* First, [install Syncthing Windows Setup or SyncTrayzor on your PC](https://syncthing.net/downloads/), and SyncThingy on your Steam Deck (via the Discover store in Desktop Mode).\n* With the Syncthing clients open on both machines, pair them by exchanging device IDs between PC and Steam Deck (see: [\"Getting Started\" Syncthing documentation](https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html)).\n   * Rather than going through the process of scanning the QR codes and/or sharing the device IDs somehow, you may be able to just select the respective devices from the nearby devices list (after confirming each device's respective ID first).\n\n# Create Shared Folders on the Steam Deck side of Syncthing\n\n* The [SyncThing guide on the EmuDeck Wiki](https://emudeck.github.io/community-creations/steamos/tools-and-guides/#how-to-set-up-syncthing) lists the appropriate Steam Deck paths and Ignore Patterns for several emulators.\n* In other cases, you can usually find the appropriate paths by launching the emulators themselves and looking for options to open the emulator or save file folder locations.\n   * (NOTE: if you set up EmuDeck on a microSD card instead of the Steam Deck's drive, replace any instances of \"mmcblk0p1\" with the name you set for the microSD card).\n   * The formatting provided in that guide is kind of confusing, but the (text) in the first line of each section WITHIN (but not including) \"path=(text)\" goes in the General > Folder Path field on Syncthing.\n   * The text BELOW (but not including) the \"Ignore Patterns:\" line should be pasted in the matching Ignore Patterns field.\n   * **However, in most cases you probably won't even need to set up the Ignore Patterns like that (see below).**\n* You may also want to sync other folders beyond just save data (BIOS/keys, game updates, metadata, etc.), but I will leave those decisions up to your discretion.\n\n# Ignore Patterns\n\n* The Ignore Patterns field in Syncthing creates a .stignore file in the directory, telling Syncthing what items in there should NOT be included when synced.\n* In most cases, you don't actually need to set up complex Ignore Patterns, as you can just isolate folders such that they should only ever contain relevant files to sync, such as within the save file folders themselves (see examples below).\n* Configuring specific Ignore Patterns is mostly convenient for when you can catch two or more relevant things in one directory (such as saves and states folders) while ignoring the rest of the stuff in there, saving you the hassle of having to make individual Shared Folders for each item.\n* **\"(?d).DS\\_Store\" excludes the hidden folder metadata file that is only applicable to that specific folder, and could cause issues if improperly synced.**\n   * \"A pattern beginning with a (?d) prefix enables removal of these files if they are preventing directory deletion. This prefix should be used by any OS generated files which you are happy to be removed.\"\n   * I'm not sure if it's explicitly necessary, but it seems like good practice and it's even mentioned in the Syncthing documentation examples, so I just include it in all of my Ignore Patterns.\n* Lines marked with \"//\" are comments (non-functional and just for descriptions).\n* Lines marked with \"!/\" marks items as \"do NOT exclude\" (or in other words, \"include\").\n* \"\\*\" excludes anything else in the folder not marked as \"do not exclude\".\n* **Syncthing lets you set a basic default ignore pattern for all new folders, so you don't have to waste your time copy-pasting the same thing over and over like I did.**\n* **(Per device/client) Syncthing > Actions > Settings > Edit Folder Defaults > Ignore Patterns > paste the following:**\n\n&#8203;\n\n    // INCLUDE\n    // items to force-include go below this (prefix with !)\n    \n    // IGNORE\n    // other items to exclude go below this\n    \n    (?d).DS_Store\n\n# Share the folders from the Steam Deck with the PC\n\n* In the Sharing menu of each Shared Folder on Steam Deck, select the PC that you paired to begin sharing/syncing that folder.\n* On your PC, accept the share request on Syncthing, then add the corresponding local folder path.\n* As mentioned above, you can typically find each equivalent folder on PC that contains an emulator's saves by opening the emulator and finding an option to open the saves folder for the emulator or for an individual game.\n* **There are important exceptions to this mentioned below.**\n* In most cases, you can add the same Ignore Patterns for each Shared Folder on PC as you did on Steam Deck.\n* You may find it more convenient to set up all of your Shared Folders on the Steam Deck or Windows first, and then go back to share them all in a row, rather than going back and forth to set up each pair.\n* For some emulator setups, the saves and states folders may be stored in separate locations on one platform, but together on the other. In these cases, they need to be split into separate Shared Folder syncs, but the path on the platform where they are stored together will be used twice. Syncthing will give you a small warning when you do this, but it should be fine as long as you set things up properly.\n* You may also encounter scenarios where the emulator's path names are different on Windows and Steam Deck for whatever reason, such as a \"savedata\" folder on one VS a \"saves\" folder on the other. This can cause the syncing to create a mega-folder that syncs the Steam Deck's folders into the PC directory and vice versa (so now both directories will have both the \"savedata\" and \"saves\" folders, and the saves will not be unified in one folder).\n* To deal with cases like this, you need to adjust your Saved Folder setups. Rather than trying to sync the folders containing the \"savedata\" or \"saves\" folders, set up the Shared Folders to go a layer deeper and sync the contents of those folders with each other instead (contents of \"savedata\" folder synced with the contents of \"saves\" folder).\n\n# Dealing with symlinks\n\n* **!!! IMPORTANT !!! On Windows, EmuDeck does some rearranging using \"symlinks\" as part of its setup for some emulators (ex. RetroArch, Dolphin, azahar). These symlinks can be identified by the folder icon having a box with an arrow in it tacked onto it.**\n* While the EmuDeck wiki tutorial mentions that it \"avoids symlinks\" as they are not compatible with Syncthing, it does not actually explain HOW to avoid dealing with said symlinks. This can be the source of frustrating and confusing errors in Syncthing, and caused me several hours of frustration.\n* **If an emulator points you to a save folder, and that save folder is actually a symlink (go 1 level above to the parent folder and look for the symlink icon), first try checking \"D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\[emulator\\]\\\\saves\" for the actual location of your save files.**\n* As for the full explanation, \"symlinks\", or \"symbolic links\", are special files that are treated as though they are in the location they are placed in, while actually pointing to a different location (like shortcuts, but at the file system level).\n* EmuDeck uses symlinks to clean up certain aspects of emulator configuration, such as storing save files from various emulators in a centralized location while still allowing the emulators to \"see\" them as if they were in their expected default locations. (Note: I think EmuDeck is technically using junctions, not symlinks, but whatever.)\n* However, since these symlinks are just pointers pointing to a different location where the files actually are, they are not compatible with Syncthing. You need to find the locations of the ACTUAL save file folders to input into Syncthing.\n* To do this, launch Command Prompt on Windows and do the following whenever a symlink is encountered.\n   * Input: cd \"\\[path where the symlink is located\\]\"\n   * Input: dir /al\n* This should identify any symlinks in the folder, and where they point to. When setting up the corresponding PC folder paths to match with the Steam Deck paths, use these \"real\" folder paths instead of the \"fake\" symlink paths. By default, most of the symlinks should point to somewhere like \"D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\[emulator\\]\\\\saves\".\n* **Similarly, if you are trying to sync a folder that includes any symlinks, you need to manually exclude all of the symlinks in the Ignore Patterns for that Shared Folder (ex. \"/saves\"), or else Syncthing will throw an error.**\n\n# Finishing setup\n\n* Syncthing does include sync conflict protection, but you may also want to enable File Versioning backups on the Shared Folders you set up (on the Steam Deck side, PC side, or both) if you want extra protection against sync error shenanigans.\n* Some additional/final troubleshooting steps are listed below.\n* Once you are finished doing all of that, you're finally done! You can now switch to Desktop Mode and launch SyncThingy whenever you want to sync data with your PC.\n   * Make sure that Syncthing is also running on your PC.\n   * Alternatively, you can try setting up Syncthing to run automatically in Gaming Mode, per the link above, though I personally didn't bother with this.\n\n# Fix Syncthing not being able to write to .var folder\n\n* (NOTE: To be honest, I'm not sure when exactly this becomes a problem, but multiple guides and comments mentioned it solving issues they were having, so I did it just in case.)\n* In Desktop Mode, install Flatseal via Discover.\n* Launch Flatseal, and scroll on the left sidebar until you find Syncthing/SyncThingy, and select it.\n* On the right, scroll down to \"Filesystem\".\n* Under \"Other files\", click the icon of a folder with a plus sign.\n* Type \"\\~/.var/app:rw\" (no quotes) in the field that appears.\n* Close Flatseal and restart the Steam Deck to apply changes.\n\n# (Obsolete?) Resolve port conflict between Syncthing and Decky\n\n* (NOTE: This may not be an issue in more recent builds of Syncthing, so first verify if you actually need to do anything before wasting your time like I did.)\n   * In Desktop Mode, open Syncthing and access the Web GUI.\n   * Actions > Settings > GUI > GUI Listen Address\n   * If the GUI Listen Address already ends in 8384 (or anything other than 8080 I guess?), then you don't have to do anything.\n   * Else if the GUI Listen Address ends in 8080, proceed as follows.\n* Switch to Gaming Mode > Settings > Developer (Enable Developer Mode in System settings if you haven't already)\n* UNCHECK: CEF Remote Debugging\n* Switch to Desktop Mode and open Syncthing GTK to access the Web GUI.\n* Actions > Settings > GUI > GUI Listen Address\n* Change the port on \"GUI Listen Address\" from 8080 to 8384 (i.e. \"0.0.0.0:8080\" becomes \"0.0.0.0:8384\").\n* Switch back to Gaming Mode and re-enable CEF Remote Debugging.\n* Switch back to Desktop Mode and re-install Decky.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you've made it this far, then hopefully everything should be working, and you can now enjoy convenient cross-save and syncing between your Steam Deck and PC over your local network. Yay!\n\nI know the post was exceedingly long, but I hope it was worth the effort of trying to clarify each step of the process. Please let me know if there are any mistakes or important points that I missed!\n\nI'll close out the post with some examples of the Shared Folders that I set up for myself.\n\n# Emulation - Extra Files (BIOS, Keys, ETC)\n\n* (extraFiles is a folder I made to tuck away things like BIOS, system firmware, etc.)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\extraFiles\n* Steam Deck path: /run/media/deck/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/extraFiles\n\n# Emulation - Game Metadata/Media\n\n* (This is the folder that Emulation Station dumps its scraped game metadata in)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\storage\\\\downloaded\\_media\n* Steam Deck path: /run/media/deck/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/storage/downloaded\\_media/\n\n# azahar\n\n* (saves and states are in different paths on Steam Deck)\n* Windows path (Saves): D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\azahar\\\\saves\n* Windows path (States): D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\azahar\\\\states\n* Steam Deck path (Saves): /run/media/\\[SDCardName\\]/Emulation/storage/azahar/sdmc\n* Steam Deck path (States): /home/deck/.local/share/azahar-emu/states\n\n# Dolphin\n\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\dolphin\n* Steam Deck path: /home/deck/.var/app/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu/data/dolphin-emu\n\n# RetroArch\n\n* (The Steam Deck directory contains more stuff, so you need to set Ignore Patterns to only include the saves and states folders)\n* Windows path: D:\\\\Emulation\\\\saves\\\\retroarch\n* Steam Deck: /home/deck/.var/app/org.libretro.RetroArch/config/retroarch\n\n# Ignore Patterns\n\n    // INCLUDE\n    !/saves\n    !/states\n    // IGNORE\n    *\n    (?d).DS_Store",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

I think this is my first time doing a post in the sub.\n\nI'm having a super hard time deciding what motor it's the best option for my two door garage, as I don't have space for the classic \"piston type\" motors, as they use at least 20cm per side once the door is open.\n\nI saw a short on youtube of a brazilian guy (I wasn't able to find it again :( ) using this kind of motors, meant for sheet metal door garages:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jggxvhuyo2wf1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6812395e5bd442077b53fa49e0c6db4f721c2a5\n\nMounted on the frame on top, one per door and using the button input of the boards for automation, I'm thinking I can use the builtin sensor input on one of the boards to avoid opening one before the other and on the one that needs to open first, a ESPHome or Tasmota as a bridge to my OpenHAB.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks in advance!",

The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather). The fingerprint access is the reason I bought them at the time, and it rarely works (even when I reprogram the lock, it forgets my prints in a week or two). I will not buy another Utec and when I searched the group that's what people recommended.  \nWe are looking for a deadbolt replacement lock (no handle / knob needed) that has fingerprint and bluetooth (no wifi).

I'm trying to come up with a way to use a bluetooth (not wifi) thermometer/hygrometer and connect it to a pc (windows). I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

    "selftext": "Moving next month to new home. I’m starting over on my home automation.  In my current home there are about 30, mostly Wi-Fi devices including four Alexa Echo device.  The new house is a chalet built in 1910 reformed in 2021.  The walls are thick and the two story chalet is narrow and deep.  I am planning on using Amazon’s eero 6E Pro mesh network with Zigbee to give good coverage.\n\nI have an Apple TV and want to be able to see who is at the door.  In the past I tried to do this with Amazon Ring doorbell camera and Fire TV.  By the time I could see the door video on the TV I could have gotten up and answered the door, twice… three times!  In short, it was so slow as to be useless.  Hopefully, HomeKit can do better.\n\nI am considering getting Homey or Home Assistant - I don’t know if that would help with speed.  It would be okay if the camera is separate from the doorbell.  I just want it to connect fast enough to be useful.  I am open to anything that solves this problem.  Moving in December so there is time to shop Black Friday sales and even change the mesh devices or other devices.",

The temp/humidity info needs to be relayed to a laptop sitting in the next room over where it should be logged and have some sort of alert system in case the temperature spikes or drops too low. \n\nHere are the limitations; it cannot connect use wifi, only bluetooth (our lab is part of a university, which won't allow 3rd party tools like sensors to use the wifi). Also, it cannot have a wire connecting the sensor to the laptop (the door in between is on an airlock system and must be fully sealed). \n\nI've found plenty of sensors that do everything I want but only connect to apple/android products, or use wifi. Can anyone help me find one that will wirelessly connect to a PC and help monitor the conditions in the specimen room? please help a girl out :'-)",

Right now, there’s an old intercom system that lets me talk to visitors and open the gate remotely from inside the house.

Power is already available at the gate, and the electric strike works fine.\n\nMy idea was to install a mobile LTE/5G router at the gate to provide Wi-Fi there and then use a device like Ring or a similar system for the video doorbell.\n\nMy questions:\n\t•\tWould you approach this differently?\n\t•\tAny recommendations for specific brands or systems?\n\t•\tCan a system like Ring, Nuki (or similar) actually control an electric strike, or would I need a different setup for that part?\n\t•\tIdeally, I’d like one provider for both the gate doorbell and a smart doorbell/lock at the main house door, to keep everything within one ecosystem, or do you think that having different systems does not make a huge difference?\n\nThanks a lot for any tips or setups that worked well for you!",

    "selftext": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI'd like to share my open-source project **Proxmox-GitOps**, a Container Automation platform for provisioning and orchestrating Linux containers (LXC) on Proxmox VE - encapsulated as comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC).\n\n**Proxmox-GitOps (@Github)**: [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps)\n \n* **Demo** (~1m): [https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY](https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY)\n\n* **Demo** (low, no ads): [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif)\n\n\n**TL;DR**: By encapsulating infrastructure within an extensible monorepository - recursively resolved from Git submodules at runtime - Proxmox-GitOps provides a comprehensive Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) abstraction for an entire, automated, container-based infrastructure.\n\nOriginally, it was a personal attempt to bring industrial automation and cloud patterns to my Proxmox home server. It's designed as a platform architecture for a self-contained, bootstrappable system - a generic IaC abstraction (customize, extend, .. open standards, base package only, .. - you name it 😉) that automates the entire infrastructure. It was initially driven by the question of what a Proxmox-based GitOps automation could look like and how it could be organized.\n\n**Core Concepts**\n\n* **Recursive Self-management**: Control plane seeds itself by pushing its monorepository onto a locally bootstrapped instance, triggering a pipeline that recursively provisions the control plane onto PVE.\n\n* **Monorepository**: Centralizes infrastructure as comprehensive IaC artifact (for mirroring, like the project itself on Github) using submodules for modular composition.\n\n* **Git as State**: Git repository represents the desired infrastructure state.\n\n* **Loose coupling**: Containers are decoupled from the control plane, enabling runtime replacement and independent operation.\n\nOver the past few months, the project stabilized, and I’ve addressed many questions you had in Wiki, summarized to documentation, which should now covers essential technical, conceptual, and practical aspects. I’ve also added a short demo that breaks down the theory by demonstrating the automation of an IaC stack (Home Assistant, Mosquitto bridge, Zigbee2MQTT broker, snapshot restore, reverse proxy, dynamically configured via PVE API), with automated container system updates and service checks.\n\n**What am I looking for?** It's a noncommercial, passion-driven project. I'm looking to collaborate with other engineers who share the excitement of building a self-contained, bootstrappable platform architecture that addresses the question: What should our home automation look like?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts!",

I had set up some simple notifications to our phones like over fire when temp > 800F and reload when temp < 250F, but it was a bit of a pain to pull my phone out throughout the night to keep tabs on the stove. Tonight, I mapped the temperature reading to a hue value on the hue/sat color wheel and setup an automation to gradually adjust a virtually unused wyze color bulb in the corner for a visual stove temperature indication. After burn #1 with it in place, I'm pretty satisfied! Blue = cold, green = target, red = hot.

    "title": "My impression of SmartWings shades",
    "selftext": "The other day I got into a convo wth another Redditor who asked in this sub some specifics about SmartWings shades. I bought some earlier this year for a couple of the bedrooms and then installed a set in my home office yesterday, so I thought I would write a longer review.\n\nMy smarthome setup consists of Google Home, a Hubitat hub, and primarily Z-Wave Plus products. All of my SmartWings shades have Z-Wave Plus motors. In the bedrooms I installed 90% blackout Zebra shades. Yesterday I installed a 70% blackout woven wood roller shade in my home office.\n\nWhen ordering there's a good bit of information to fill in and a number of choices to make, so be sure to allow yourself a sufficient block of time. The fabric colors are clearly outlined but it's not always easy to make a proper comparison from a PC or phone. You can order a book of fabric samples, which I did prior to placing my second order.\n\nThe measuring instructions are clear and there's no need to overcompensate for anything. I added the minimum suggested amount to the window length and the side blackout works great. For the Zebra shade height I overcompensated and ended up having to mount the Zebra shades higher than originally planned because the bedroom window sills jut out a bit. The Zebra shades have to be mounted at an exact height so that the fabric lines up correctly when the shade is fully closed.  If there's no obstruction like a window sill then that won't really matter, but in my case it did and I measured too long, That was user error on my part. Just measure the window height and add the suggested amount for the mounts. There's no need to add any length past that.\n\nShipping takes a few weeks since they come from China. Once the order is marked as in transit, the shipment arrives within a few days.\n\nInstallation is easy, unless you measure too long like I did. :D There are a handful of brackets to install for the Zebra shades, and if you order an outside mount like I did, there are extenders to install as well. The woven wood shade that I ordered recently is even easier to install, with brackets only and a top-down connection. I recommend having an installation buddy for any blind wider than a single window. The blinds aren't heavy but if lengthy they can be unwieldy to hold solo.\n\nConnecting to the home network is easy, requiring only the app for your hub and the appropriate PIN or ID for the device.\n\nI didn't get the solar chargers on any of the blinds, figuring I would just charge them as needed. Thus far I've only had to charge the bedroom blinds twice in 8 months. \n\nI've been highly satisfied with the blinds in the bedrooms, and the newly installed woven wood shade in my office is working great as well.  These blinds are on the pricier side but the quality is excellent and the setup is easy.\n\nOne other note: at first I was using my ADT alarm system as the hub and not Hubitat.  Google Home wouldn't recognize the blinds even though they had been added to ADT successfully. Of ADT, Google, and SmartWings, only the SmartWings customer service rep seemed to have any clue a to what was going on. ADT's response was \"sorry we don't sell that product so I can't help you.\" Google customer support told me to disconnect and reconnect ADT even though I plainly told them that I'd already tried that, and when it still didn't work they said \"oh that's too bad thanks bye.\" Ha. The SmartWings chat rep listened to what was going on and correctly suspected that the ADT controller wasn't properly communicating the presence of the blinds with Google Home. They recommended that I switch my hub to either Google Hub or one of their other supported hubs. I went with Hubitat and now it all works great.\n\nBottom line, SmartWings are solid and easy to set up smart blinds.",

I want to make good choices early so I don’t have to upgrade later, but I’m having trouble deciding what that means for my project. \n\nThe house is a 4 story townhome in the the middle of a city so I do want some cameras and security features, but I don’t have a yard, just a 1 car garage. I think maybe having PoE run everywhere is the right way to do it? I have a little bit of an attention deficit and replacing batteries in a bunch of devices is a hassle. \n\nI also need a little advice on how to figure out what’s already been set up, the house has a Bluetooth speaker system throughout, and there were some digital intercom screens set up in a few rooms but they appeared to be turned off we did the tour/inspection. \n\nThere’s also the matter of hardware and software choices. I’ve heard great things about the unifi ubiquiti platform and would like to try a nice network setup as a backbone for the project, and I’m excited to build on an open sourced platform like home assistant. I tried having a conversation with an LLM about hardware and some things like a dedicated firewall seem like overkill? It’s tough to right size a system without having seen common setups before.\n\nAll of these variables have led me into a bit of an analysis paralysis, I wanted to start home lab-ing a bit in preparation but can’t decide what parts of the project I can get a head start on or if I should just wait to get the keys. I feel if I wait too long to run the cat6 I might have to do it after our stuff is moved in making things a little harder (I have a month and a half or so of overlap to move), but I figure getting someone out here to do the work twice will cost more so I should figure out how many ports I’m going to have them drop quickly. \n\nMostly just looking for general advice, tips, or other experiences to learn from on how to properly design and diagram everything and come up with a semblance of a plan going into the new home. Help!",

    "selftext": "So I recently discovered the Anki Vector Robot on TikTok, and I’ve been fascinated ever since. He’s this tiny AI companion that can tell the weather, take photos, roll dice, and even deal blackjack. When connected to Alexa, he can also handle smart home tasks like controlling lights or adding things to your shopping list. It’s wild how much personality they packed into such a small device. What I love most is how interactive he seems. You can say, “Hey Vector, I have a question,” and he’ll actually think before answering, kind of like a miniature voice assistant with a face. He also reacts when you touch or move him, thanks to built-in sensors that make him feel almost alive. Pet him, and he relaxes; shake him, and he gets grumpy (which, fair enough). The only concern I’ve found is that the original company, Anki, went out of business, so some features now rely on third-party servers like Wire Pod to stay functional. Still, the charm is undeniable. If you’re shopping around, I noticed the Anki Vector Robot is available on Alibaba at much more reasonable prices than Amazon’s listings. Anyone here using Vector lately, does he still live up to the hype? Edit: Reposted ",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

Props to them for doing the right thing. They not only created a solid product but they also made sure that the end user would be able to use the product without having to buy another battery from zooz. \n\nI know it’s stupid but this has made a loyal customer out of me and I deeply respect this company. \n",

Mainly they're only lockable (reliably) from the inside / manually. The motor sounds like it is locking when you push the lock button, but it doesn't actually lock (even with fresh batteries). The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather). The fingerprint access is the reason I bought them at the time, and it rarely works (even when I reprogram the lock, it forgets my prints in a week or two). I will not buy another Utec and when I searched the group that's what people recommended.  \nWe are looking for a deadbolt replacement lock (no handle / knob needed) that has fingerprint and bluetooth (no wifi). Any secure ones out there that are resistant to drilling? If we had to go with no bluetooth, that would be fine too. Thanks in advance.",

I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this).

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

Since it would be too expensive for me to replace all the switches with smart ones (especially because I have the same problem in other parts of the apartment), and since it’s also not possible for me to replace the ceiling spots themselves, I’m looking for a way to integrate them into my Home Assistant system.\n\nThe light switches are configured in a multi-way (intermediate) circuit.\n\nDoes it make sense — or is it even possible — to replace only one of the switches in this setup, or would that not work? Are there any other options I might not have considered?\n\nI hope everything is understandable :D I am not a native speaker.\n\nThank you in advance guys!\n\n  \nEDIT1: I it is a Intermediate switching/4-way switch circuit",

It has physical stop settings, so the risk of overtravel is limited as long as those don't fail, but the motor switch is 3-position.\n\nIt's not 3-way: it's 3-position, that is, the up position goes clockwise, down goes counter-clockwise, and there's a middle neutral position that is off. A switch like that would have to have a very specific \"on\" time. Like, I should be able to tell it how long it takes to extend fully and program that time in seconds.\n\n  \nIs there any product that works well and integrates with the typical smart home hubs that would work? Right now, we have and really like Hue hub for our exterior lights and a way to hook this up to Hue would be awesome. What I'd like to avoid is another Wi-Fi-based switch with a proprietary app. I am pretty handy, but a plug-and-play switch is really all I'm willing to invest in for this project.",

At times, I even get the message “Unable to load Favourites,” although they were initially visible.\n* No error messages, no logs, no response from Amazon.\n* After switching to a different Alexa account, the same issues reappear after a while.\n\nI suspect a cloud-side issue, since the behavior is identical across multiple devices and persists even after reinstalling the app. Other users have reported similar bugs — some going back weeks.\n\nAnd this is still the “old” Alexa — what’s coming our way with Alexa+?\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n* Has anyone experienced the same?\n* Are there any workarounds (e.g., via the web interface or voice commands)?\n* Has anyone tried bypassing the Alexa app entirely by creating a new, empty Alexa account and using Echo devices just as microphones/speakers for Home Assistant?\n* Has anyone received a meaningful response from Amazon support?",

    "selftext": "Is or has anyone else thought about doing this? Has anyone done it successfully? \n\nI'd like parts of my home to have lights turn on ONLY when there is a person detected. Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is.

    "title": "Nest thermostat seems to not learn at all?",
    "selftext": "I have a Nest thermostat in my apartment building- and have the “Auto-Schedule” feature on.\n\nPer the app description, “Auto-Schedule learns your behavior as you adjust your thermostat and automatically creates a schedule to match your heating and cooling preferences.”\n\nHowever, my Nest does not seem to be adjusting properly. I like to sleep with the temperature around 74-75, but during the day I keep it a few degrees warmer, closer to 77. Every single night I have to change the thermostat manually to be set around 75, and then I have to do the same thing every morning. It has been months and I am starting to get frustrated. Last night the temperature adjusted from 75 to 77 while I was sleeping and I woke up in the middle of the night. That would be the opposite scheduling of what I want, and I’m starting to get incredibly frustrated.\n\nDoes anyone else have similar issues, and how could I correct it?",

Circles represent lights, split into circuits that I’ve colour coded. \n\nWhen I leave for work, it’s dark, and I currently have to turn on and off about a million switches to light my way to the front door. \n\nWhat i would like is an extra switch next to ‘Green Circuit Switch 2’ that turns on and off ALL the lights between the kitchen and the front door. I would like another extra switch next to ‘Blue Circuit Switch 1’ that does the same. \n\nI still want to be able to control each circuit separately too. \n\nI have a WiFi mesh system that supports Matter. I also have a Tapo hub and a NAS running home assistant. I’m planning to get an Apple TV at some point too. \n\nI don’t mind setting up automations but i want physical switches rather than PIR triggered lights. \n\nI think I need a combination of smart switches and relays?  Like, a smart switch at each far end, combined with a smart relay hidden behind the regular lighting panels of the other circuits. And when I hit either of the smart switches, the relays are all automated to turn on or off. \n\nIs that right?! What’s the best way to run such an automation? Or is there a better solution?\n\nThank you!\n",

    "selftext": "Hi -\n\nI have a (new to me) 100+ year old house with some old wiring in areas. Several circuits don't have a neutral wire. Other circuits run through tight electrical boxes, and won't accomodate larger standard ZWave or Zigbee switches like Jasco/GE/Enbrighten. Lutron Caseta doesn't fit the aesthetic of this old Victorian. This is new territory for me, so I am looking at the Sonoff units like the one below.  \n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYNRF8GV?ref=ppx\\_yo2ov\\_dt\\_b\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYNRF8GV?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)\n\nI am using Home Assistant now - I been using SmartThings from Samsung/Aeotek for 10 years.  I ordered the Sonoff Pro Hub just in case I need it, but I'd rather integrate directly with HA. My Home Assistant Green has both Zigbee and Zwave plug ins already installed and working.\n\nI'd love to hear from some folks with similar setups and their experiences with them. This is a larger house, and there are probably 14 light circuits that I would like to control.\n\nTIA",

It took some time, but I’ve decided it’s time to overhaul everything; desk, chairs, blackboard, and, most importantly, my bed. After long nights of work and countless tabs open, comfort has become non-negotiable.\n\nAnd that’s how I stumbled onto the concept of the Smart Bed. Adjustable firmness, sleep tracking, temperature control; the features sound straight out of a sci-fi film. Getting one now feels more possible than ever with all the online options available. My friend even helped me look through various designs on Alibaba and we were able to narrow it down to 2 peculiar interests. \n\nBut here’s the catch: while money isn’t the issue, I can’t shake off this nagging thought. Shouldn’t my late-night hours be a sanctuary away from screens and tech? Am I inviting more distractions into a space that should balance work and rest?\n\nPart of me is excited about the upgrade, but another part feels skeptical. Will a smart bed genuinely improve my life, or is it just a shiny gadget I don’t really need?\n\nSo please, I’d love your take. Do you own a smart bed? Is it worth the hype, or should I stick to a traditional high-quality mattress? What are the hidden pros and cons no one talks about?",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

It has physical stop settings, so the risk of overtravel is limited as long as those don't fail, but the motor switch is 3-position.\n\nIt's not 3-way: it's 3-position, that is, the up position goes clockwise, down goes counter-clockwise, and there's a middle neutral position that is off. A switch like that would have to have a very specific \"on\" time. Like, I should be able to tell it how long it takes to extend fully and program that time in seconds.\n\n  \nIs there any product that works well and integrates with the typical smart home hubs that would work? Right now, we have and really like Hue hub for our exterior lights and a way to hook this up to Hue would be awesome. What I'd like to avoid is another Wi-Fi-based switch with a proprietary app. I am pretty handy, but a plug-and-play switch is really all I'm willing to invest in for this project.",

    "selftext": "Is or has anyone else thought about doing this? Has anyone done it successfully? \n\nI'd like parts of my home to have lights turn on ONLY when there is a person detected. Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

I saw that the company shut down or something like that. I have zero interest in any complicated set ups to make it work again so I'm looking to replace them. What are some good budget replacements? Something bright but it doesn't have to be crazy. RGB isn't necessary but I did enjoy switching to red lights whenever I felt overstimulated. ㅤNeed 4. \n\nI loved the simple operation of the Sengled bulbs being controlled from my phone with Google Assistant or through the app. \n\n2. Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up? Something without a subscription.\n\n  \nAdded request - We're using a really old camera system. I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription. I don't live in the US and spending USD adds up really quick with forex limits.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nPS.

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

I rarely use the living room switches, the kitchen switches (2 way without ground) worked great until 2 days ago and quit working and won't reset. I've had to replace the dining room (3 way without ground) twice already, and it is not working again. I'm tired of spending @ $75.00 per switch every few months. Has anyone else experienced the short lifespan of Lutron smart switches? If so, what brand did you switch (no pun intended) too? ",

Ich möchte, dass sie gleichzeitig angehen, aber sanft heller werden – also ein weiches Hochdimmen, statt einfach „zack, Licht an“.\n\nIdealerweise soll das Ganze auch beim Ausschalten sanft abdimmen. Ich suche also keine Lauflicht-Animation, sondern einfach einen gleichmäßigen Fade-In / Fade-Out für alle Spots zusammen.\n\nGesteuert wird bei mir über [Hue-Bridge / Home Assistant / Zigbee2MQTT – bitte hier anpassen].\nDie Spots laufen mit [230 V / 12 V / 24 V – bitte anpassen].\n\nKennt jemand einen Zigbee-Dimmer oder Controller, der solche Übergänge unterstützt?\nAm liebsten ein Modell, das zuverlässig mit Zigbee3.0-Netzen funktioniert.\n\nFreue mich über jeden Tipp oder Erfahrungswert!",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nTech newbie looking for assistance. Just yesterday, I got a BSOD while using my M.2. SSD's Windows 11, which was recently force upgraded. The events leading up to it that were odd are the following:\n\n1. I tried to open Spotify a couple times with no success. I did not see anything Spotify related in my Task Manager. Tried to Run as Administrator and still nothing.\n\n2. On Google Chrome, I came across a website (not p0rn surfing) that sent me to what seemed to be a TikTok page, which force shut down my Google Chrome. Restoring my session with the same tabs, it force shut down again. My 2nd time restoring tabs, I closed that particular tab before it crashed my chrome and things worked fine for a but until I got the BSOD- Stop Code: CRITICAL PROCESS DIED. I fear this might be some kind of malware/virus\n\nRebooting my PC, it just gives me a black screen. Rebooting again, it set up the Repair Tool and I reinstalled Windows 11 through the Cloud. Now, I get very basic apps with a black background. Clicking on anything just keeps the computer thinking until I get the same BSOD. I am currently using an older Samsung SSD with Windows 10 on it to use my computer but would like to get the M.2 figured out again. I can see the M.2 Drive on File Explorer and all its contents. Any suggestions while I hop on the phone with Windows support?\n\n  \nMy current specs are as follows:\n\nMotherboard: B650E Max Gaming Wifi\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 9600X 6-Core Processor\n\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n\nM.2 SSD: INland QN450 NVMe SSD\n\n  \nAppreciate the help in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

The WiFi connection really won't work, and both the 2.5G and 5G indicator lights are not lit. This started happening during frequent brownouts and sudden fluctuations in electricity due to power outages. I have tried all possible fixes, including watching YouTube tutorials and asking AI. Here are what I have done:\n\n* Accessed the Admin Panel (192.168.1.1) - enabled the RADIO and SSID.\n* Hard reset and enabled RADIO and SSID using an Ethernet cable.\n* Pressed the WLAN and WLAN buttons at the back and waited for the lights to turn on. I pressed for 5 seconds then released, waited 30 seconds then released, but the lights still won't turn on. Restarted the modem and tried pressing for 5 seconds, 30 seconds, or even 2 minutes, but still no lights.\n\nIt's really hassle, because even though the admin panel indicates that broadcast is ON and SSID is enabled, the lights still won't turn on. Also, pressing the WLAN and WLAN2 buttons at the back of the router doesn't turn on the lights. Does it need a replacement router? Thank you very much in advance for your advice!  \n[](https://preview.redd.it/pldt-fibr-router-wifi-problem-need-tips-v0-7b4j302lj3wf1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc1f073de2483ccc4081888c52ca3a5981b01b12)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI’m trying to figure out if what I’m seeing could be related to the known Intel 13th/14th gen instability issue.\n\nMy PC **instantly shuts down during demanding games like Borderlands 4 and Battlefield 6** no BSOD, no warning, just complete power loss and then it **reboots itself after a few seconds**.\n\nIt never happens in light games (like Left 4 Dead 2), which makes me suspect something related to high CPU/GPU load.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* **CPU:** Intel Core i7-13700K (AIO cooled – ASUS ROG STRIX LC II 240)\n* **GPU:** PNY RTX 3080 Ti 12GB XLR8\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG STRIX B660-A GAMING WIFI\n* **RAM:** Corsair Vengeance RGB 2×16GB DDR5 6000MHz\n* **PSU:** ASUS ROG STRIX 850W TUF (Modular)\n* **Storage:** WD Black SN770 2TB NVMe\n\n**Details:**\n\n* Temps are fine (HWInfo logs confirm).\n* No BSOD or dump file only Kernel-Power 41 in Event Viewer.\n* Happened both with and without a surge protector.\n* Voltages looked stable right until the power cut.\n* BIOS updated to the newest version.\n\nCould this be one of those **Intel 13th/14th gen stability defects** people have been reporting lately?  \nIf so is there any way to confirm it, or settings I can tweak (like power limits or undervolting) to test it safely?\n\nAny help would be super appreciated 🙏",

I will hear (through my headset) a pretty loud EEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR like a static noise. I'll have to turn my PC off, and then turn it back on and it'll just work again. \n\nThis will only happen with certain games, and *never* others. It's never happened with Tarkov or dayz or dark and darker, but it has been happening with arena breakout infinite and star citizen. It also also *never* happened when there are no games open. \n\nThere is another issue, where, OBS will constantly crash if I am recording. In my 2 most recent posts I have my 2 most recent OBS crash logs. I fully uninstalled and reinstalled it and it crashed again. \n\nStuff I have done to try fix this: \n\nUpdated all drivers to latest version \n\nDid clean driver install \n\nUpdated bios to latest version \n\nRan CPU and GPU stress tests sperately and at the same time (nothing looked abnormal to me)\n\nUsed project lasso to disable some e-cores which games apparently try to use sometimes (tried with this off and on)\n\nDisabled windows game-boost thingy (I don't remember what it's called) in the windows settings \n\nI would very much like to know what the problem is. Or be able to perform a test to identify the problem. \n\nA while ago AMD would constantly crash, sometimes causing a game crash, and sometimes causing a whole pc crash, but that doesn't happen anymore. \n\nI have also tried overclocking and not changing any default settings, and it crashes with both settings. (Though I haven't tried overclocking since doing a clean reinstall of the amd drivers). \n\nPeople have told me (on other posts) that it's my \"faulty processor\", suffering from degraging. But I don't see why some games would literally never crash, or why I have never crashed when watching YouTube and stuff or while editing or programming. \n\nI also don't feel like purchasing a new processor if I'm not very certain that that is the issue. \n\nAny assistance would be very appreciated!",

I have to hard restart my pc with the power button every time.

I use a modified power plan with only the processor power management change to min : 0% and max 99% just to lower my pc temps. I then tried to reset the power plan which didnt help. I contacted support for the \"the Finals\" and after doing what they said nothing worked for 2 weeks, they then sent my crash logs of the game to their other team to find out what the problem is. They then told me its dust build up, bought a 20$ (not American btw) air blower for nothing as that didnt even help. I tried reseating my gpu, unplugged my extra pc fans and checked cables. Still nothing. I also reset my bios settings as I had XMP/(forgot the name) on.\n\nStarting using deepseek/chatgpt and began messing with my gpu tuning. I changed my gpu frequency to 1000mhz and 825 volts (im a noob) and used radeon chill with a 30fps idle and peak. This allowed me to get past the the stupid shader loading. But now the problem is I'm unsure whether I should be buying another 45$ power supply as if that is the cause of the problem because in the past I used to have a lot power outages which I was never informed about, never used a surge protector or those type of things. I never thought it would really do anything to my pc at the time since that was 2 years ago and I've now only used it for a total of a year.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I've been having problems with my PC for days.\n\nA while ago, I discovered that my NVMe SSD (Fanxiang S880) was corrupted (perhaps due to the latest Windows update).\n\nI therefore had to temporarily install Windows on my SATA SSD, where I usually install games, while waiting to get a new drive, probably for Black Friday.\n\nThings were fine for a few days until I reinstalled some games (even heavy ones like RDR2) and software, and my PC would freeze every 1-2 minutes for about 10 seconds, but I could still move my mouse.\n\nI've only noticed that when the process that consumes the most CPU and Disk freezes, it's System, and then a few seconds later, when it returns to normal, it usually goes back to the installation process.\n\nThis situation usually occurs when I install software and games. Normally, the PC runs smoothly, even allowing me to play games without any issues.\n\n\n\nTests I performed:\n\n\\-Rollback to a previous version of Windows.\n\n\\-Tried sfc and DISM commands.\n\n\\-Reinstalled all drivers.\n\n\\-Updated BIOS and cleared CMOS.\n\n\n\nBuild:\n\n\\-Ryzen 7700x\n\n\\-NZXT B650e\n\n\\-Viper Venom 32GB 6000MHz RAM\n\n\\-MSI Vanguard RTX 5080\n\n\\-PNY CS900 1TB SATA\n\n\\-Seasonic 850W PSU\n\n\\-Thermalright Night Vision 360",

    "selftext": "Hey, I had a question for the people here. I’m wondering if it’s possible to force a 16:9 aspect ratio game into 16:10 ratio through the AMD Adrenalin app?\n\nI was looking into a new handheld gaming PC, but the screen aspect ratio is 16:10, compared to my old ROG Ally which has a 16:9 screen. \nI know some games don’t natively support 16:10 and will have black bars on the top and bottom of the screen when you have to leave them at their 16:9 ratio. \n\nI was wondering if it’s possible to force games into a 16:10 ratio through the Adrenalin app so they stretch to the full screen size? I don’t mind if they’re a bit distorted or stretched by doing this. I’d just rather them taking up the full 16:10 screen. \nI did some googling and saw some AMD article about [GPU Scaling] (https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/DH3-019.html) option in Adrenalin, possibly what I’m looking for? \nBut I quickly tested it on the handheld when I was testing it out, but couldn’t seem to get it to work? \nIs this even the right setting, or am I trying to do something entirely different here? If it’s not possible to do in the AMD app, is there any other way around this?\nI’m not really knowledgeable when it comes to this sort of thing, so I thought I’d ask here to see if it was possible. \n\nThanks a lot!",

If I do these when in a menu or on their own... no issues... hence feeling its when under load.\n\nIt also was more common in the heat but feel this is a red herring.\n\nOriginally I thought maybe my 1080 was struggling so upgraded to a 3080.... no luck\n\nSo then ran a full memtest which came up with no issues, have rebuild the PC with new thermal paste, and most recently installed a new PSU as someone pointed to that being the issue.\n\nAll of which has made no difference.\n\nWhen I do BSOD on reboot I open event viewer and always have under source 'Kernal - Boot' and an error in creating a dump file.\n\nTyping this out leads me to think it has been a bad windows install, however would like to seek the opinion of better knowledge before going down that route.\n\nThanks",

I searched up the Halloween costume and clicked on the first shein link that came up labelled ‘SHEIN UK’. It took me to shein.co.uk, but it was asking to complete one of those ‘I’m not a robot’ tasks which I found odd because shein has never asked me to do that before. I skipped it and it wouldn’t let me on the website, saying my time has expired, so I went back into the verification thing and started doing it. I got half way through before I realised it was odd and went off the website. I have a massive fear of being hacked, and I know getting a virus or malware on a fully updated phone is hard but now I’m overthinking that it was a fake website I clicked on. Anyone experience the same thing or able to give me reassurance? Thanks. ",

Sometimes removing one or two RAM sticks helps as well.\n\nHowever, over time, the problem has gotten worse—I have to make more and more attempts to get the PC to start. Now, it can take me up to 10 minutes of trying before it finally powers on.\n\nIn the meantime, both the GPU and CPU have been swapped, and the problem still persists.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been struggling with random crashes and instability on my PC lately, and I’m hoping to get some insight or help from the community.\n\nSystem setup:\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 9700X\n* AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT\n* 32GB RAM, running at DOCP 6000\n* Windows 11 Pro latest build (I was dual booting fedora, the issues were the same)\n* All drivers updated, motherboard BIOS updated (Asus TUF B650M-PLUS)\n\n\n\nSymptoms:\n\n* No issues at all when doing other stuff than gaming.\n* Sometimes I can game normally for hours, no issues, and then other times I just get crashes (not game crashes usually, black screen, and audio cuts, sometimes I get back one still image of what I was doing), sometimes only reaching the menus of games\n* Stress tests like FurMark, OCCT (CPU, RAM, GPU, VRAM, PSU), and MemTest pass with no issue, for hours even\n* The PC feels stable under synthetic load but randomly fails in real games\n* DDU safe mode uninstall/reinstalling latest recommended drivers not helping\n* And I can't see anything major in the logs on either, in windows I just see irregular shutdown stuff when I shut the PC down by holding the power button or using the reset button\n\n\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n\n* Clean driver reinstall using DDU in safe mode\n* BIOS update\n* Testing all components for stability (RAM, VRAM, CPU, PSU)\n* Monitoring temps, voltages, and loads during testing and gaming, all seem normal\n\nDespite all that, crashes persist after driver timeouts in games. Sometimes I can play demanding games like BF6 with no problem, other times crashes happen quickly.\n\nHave others experienced similar instability with RX 7900 XT or similar AMD setups?\n\nIs this a known ongoing driver/software issue?\n\nAny tips on which driver versions are most stable or specific BIOS settings that could help?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

Even when I’m **not signed into Google** (Incognito mode), YouTube shows my location as **IL (Israel)**  in the Topleft above the Logo. instead of DE (Germany). I also get Israeli ads. My wife’s laptop, connected to the **same Wi-Fi network**, shows the correct location **DE**.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n1. Checked my **IP address** via multiple services → all show **Bonn, Germany**.\n2. Cleared **browser cache and cookies** → still IL.\n3. Tested in **Incognito mode** → still IL.\n4. Tried **Firefox** (never really used it) → still IL.\n5. Did a **DNS flush** and `ipconfig /renew` → still IL.\n6. Checked my **Google account location** → it was set to Israel, I corrected it to Germany, but the issue **persists in Incognito / not logged in**.\n7. Checked for **VPN / Proxy / system-wide Adblockers** → nothing active at the moment.\n\nIt only happens on this specific PC. Other devices on the same network display the correct location.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea why YouTube keeps detecting my PC as being in Israel, and how I can fix it permanently? Could it be some kind of **system-level DNS / routing / leftover VPN configuration**?\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance!",

I’m wondering if it’s possible to force a 16:9 aspect ratio game into 16:10 ratio through the AMD Adrenalin app?\n\nI was looking into a new handheld gaming PC, but the screen aspect ratio is 16:10, compared to my old ROG Ally which has a 16:9 screen. \nI know some games don’t natively support 16:10 and will have black bars on the top and bottom of the screen when you have to leave them at their 16:9 ratio. \n\nI was wondering if it’s possible to force games into a 16:10 ratio through the Adrenalin app so they stretch to the full screen size? I don’t mind if they’re a bit distorted or stretched by doing this. I’d just rather them taking up the full 16:10 screen. \nI did some googling and saw some AMD article about [GPU Scaling] (https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/DH3-019.html) option in Adrenalin, possibly what I’m looking for? \nBut I quickly tested it on the handheld when I was testing it out, but couldn’t seem to get it to work? \nIs this even the right setting, or am I trying to do something entirely different here? If it’s not possible to do in the AMD app, is there any other way around this?\nI’m not really knowledgeable when it comes to this sort of thing, so I thought I’d ask here to see if it was possible. \n\nThanks a lot!",

This started happening during frequent brownouts and sudden fluctuations in electricity due to power outages. I have tried all possible fixes, including watching YouTube tutorials and asking AI. Here are what I have done:\n\n* Accessed the Admin Panel (192.168.1.1) - enabled the RADIO and SSID.\n* Hard reset and enabled RADIO and SSID using an Ethernet cable.\n* Pressed the WLAN and WLAN buttons at the back and waited for the lights to turn on. I pressed for 5 seconds then released, waited 30 seconds then released, but the lights still won't turn on. Restarted the modem and tried pressing for 5 seconds, 30 seconds, or even 2 minutes, but still no lights.\n\nIt's really hassle, because even though the admin panel indicates that broadcast is ON and SSID is enabled, the lights still won't turn on. Also, pressing the WLAN and WLAN2 buttons at the back of the router doesn't turn on the lights. Does it need a replacement router? Thank you very much in advance for your advice!  \n[](https://preview.redd.it/pldt-fibr-router-wifi-problem-need-tips-v0-7b4j302lj3wf1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc1f073de2483ccc4081888c52ca3a5981b01b12)",

My wife’s laptop, connected to the **same Wi-Fi network**, shows the correct location **DE**.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n1. Checked my **IP address** via multiple services → all show **Bonn, Germany**.\n2. Cleared **browser cache and cookies** → still IL.\n3. Tested in **Incognito mode** → still IL.\n4. Tried **Firefox** (never really used it) → still IL.\n5. Did a **DNS flush** and `ipconfig /renew` → still IL.\n6. Checked my **Google account location** → it was set to Israel, I corrected it to Germany, but the issue **persists in Incognito / not logged in**.\n7. Checked for **VPN / Proxy / system-wide Adblockers** → nothing active at the moment.\n\nIt only happens on this specific PC. Other devices on the same network display the correct location.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea why YouTube keeps detecting my PC as being in Israel, and how I can fix it permanently? Could it be some kind of **system-level DNS / routing / leftover VPN configuration**?\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance!",

    "selftext": "Hey, I had a question for the people here. I’m wondering if it’s possible to force a 16:9 aspect ratio game into 16:10 ratio through the AMD Adrenalin app?\n\nI was looking into a new handheld gaming PC, but the screen aspect ratio is 16:10, compared to my old ROG Ally which has a 16:9 screen. \nI know some games don’t natively support 16:10 and will have black bars on the top and bottom of the screen when you have to leave them at their 16:9 ratio. \n\nI was wondering if it’s possible to force games into a 16:10 ratio through the Adrenalin app so they stretch to the full screen size? I don’t mind if they’re a bit distorted or stretched by doing this. I’d just rather them taking up the full 16:10 screen. \nI did some googling and saw some AMD article about [GPU Scaling] (https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/DH3-019.html) option in Adrenalin, possibly what I’m looking for? \nBut I quickly tested it on the handheld when I was testing it out, but couldn’t seem to get it to work? \nIs this even the right setting, or am I trying to do something entirely different here? If it’s not possible to do in the AMD app, is there any other way around this?\nI’m not really knowledgeable when it comes to this sort of thing, so I thought I’d ask here to see if it was possible. \n\nThanks a lot!",

If I do these when in a menu or on their own... no issues... hence feeling its when under load.\n\nIt also was more common in the heat but feel this is a red herring.\n\nOriginally I thought maybe my 1080 was struggling so upgraded to a 3080.... no luck\n\nSo then ran a full memtest which came up with no issues, have rebuild the PC with new thermal paste, and most recently installed a new PSU as someone pointed to that being the issue.\n\nAll of which has made no difference.\n\nWhen I do BSOD on reboot I open event viewer and always have under source 'Kernal - Boot' and an error in creating a dump file.\n\nTyping this out leads me to think it has been a bad windows install, however would like to seek the opinion of better knowledge before going down that route.\n\nThanks",
