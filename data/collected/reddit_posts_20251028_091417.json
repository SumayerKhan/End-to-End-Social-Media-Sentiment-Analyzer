    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn‚Äôt an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn‚Äôt have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid.

    "selftext": ">The new M5 equipped 14‚Äù MacBook Pros offer few new features other than a modest performance bump, a new architecture which doubles the maximum storage options from 2TB to 4TB and a substantial increase in SSD read/write speeds and memory bandwidth. But that doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt room for improvement when designing for repairability, especially where Apple‚Äôs complex engineering is concerned. So the big question remaining from this year's big M5 announcement is: did Apple upgrade the MacBook Pro‚Äôs repairability?",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "title": "Added height ruler to my iOS photogrammetry app",
    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "title": "Added height ruler to my iOS photogrammetry app",
    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

I even planned to switch to the 16 Pro, but decided to wait for the 17 series. And now I see these new Pros, Air, and base model. I tried the Pro, and it felt crappy to me. The Air feels like something premium, but $1000 for a phone with one speaker, a lousy battery, and one camera seemed like too irrational a choice to me. I took a chance and got the 17. 256 GB of memory, 120 HZ, thin bezels ‚Äî I was impressed by this model. It has ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING that ordinary people need.

It had a GH3 screen with pink hue to the right no matter what. I returned it and tried an air. This had a G9P which was more yellowish at the top of the display with True Tone and night shift on. Got rid again and thought im done here just going to get the cheapest base 17. Got the 17 like the phone but it as exactly the same issue as the air. It has G9Q display. If I turn it all off the display for the most part is fine and liveable. However I‚Äôm still getting used to the blue hue it gives off with those settings disabled. My question to you guys is, would you keep going and going until you get a decent phone or would you save your mental health and just ‚Äúcope‚Äù with what you have. I have around 5 days to get rid of it but I‚Äôm just scared it‚Äôs same again plus I would have to step up to a pro probably as 17 base are as rare as rocking horse poop at the moment. ",

If I get a phone call on my iPhone, the headphones will pause the audio playback on the Mac and switch to the iPhone, which is exactly what it should do. However, when the phone call is over, the headphones will not resume playing the computer audio. If I click \"play\" on the video on the Mac, there will be no sound and the video will automatically pause after 2-3 seconds. To fix it, I have to turn off Bluetooth on the iPhone. After doing this, though, the volume on my Mac is at 100%, even though it was at maybe 50% before I got the phone call.  \n  \nI never had this issue with my old phone (Galaxy S20); it's strictly become an issue since getting the iPhone. To try and fix it, I have unsuccessfully tried:\n\n1. Unpairing and re-pairing the headphones with both devices\n2. Updating the headphone software\n3. Resetting the headphones\n4. Restoring the headphones to factory settings\n\n\n\nHas anyone else noticed a similar issue? Were you able to fix it?\n\nEdit: added other potential fixes that I've tried",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n‚Äã\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "selftext": "I was just wondering how long most people actually keep their iPhones before upgrading. I‚Äôve seen folks still using the iPhone X or even older ones that work perfectly fine while others can‚Äôt resist upgrading every single year.\nHonestly, I feel like iPhones can easily last 4 to 6 years if you take good care of them. The hardware holds up and Apple keeps pushing updates for quite a while. But it also makes me think should Apple stop selling older Pro models sooner or is it better that they keep them around for people who don‚Äôt want to spend a fortune on the latest one?\n\nSo, how old is your iPhone, and how is it holding up these days?",

I even planned to switch to the 16 Pro, but decided to wait for the 17 series. And now I see these new Pros, Air, and base model. I tried the Pro, and it felt crappy to me. The Air feels like something premium, but $1000 for a phone with one speaker, a lousy battery, and one camera seemed like too irrational a choice to me. I took a chance and got the 17. 256 GB of memory, 120 HZ, thin bezels ‚Äî I was impressed by this model. It has ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING that ordinary people need. As for the battery, it lasts me until nighttime, and the screen shows 7.5-8 hours of screen time.

If I get a phone call on my iPhone, the headphones will pause the audio playback on the Mac and switch to the iPhone, which is exactly what it should do. However, when the phone call is over, the headphones will not resume playing the computer audio. If I click \"play\" on the video on the Mac, there will be no sound and the video will automatically pause after 2-3 seconds. To fix it, I have to turn off Bluetooth on the iPhone. After doing this, though, the volume on my Mac is at 100%, even though it was at maybe 50% before I got the phone call.  \n  \nI never had this issue with my old phone (Galaxy S20); it's strictly become an issue since getting the iPhone. To try and fix it, I have unsuccessfully tried:\n\n1. Unpairing and re-pairing the headphones with both devices\n2. Updating the headphone software\n3. Resetting the headphones\n4. Restoring the headphones to factory settings\n\n\n\nHas anyone else noticed a similar issue? Were you able to fix it?\n\nEdit: added other potential fixes that I've tried",

    "selftext": "I was just wondering how long most people actually keep their iPhones before upgrading. I‚Äôve seen folks still using the iPhone X or even older ones that work perfectly fine while others can‚Äôt resist upgrading every single year.\nHonestly, I feel like iPhones can easily last 4 to 6 years if you take good care of them. The hardware holds up and Apple keeps pushing updates for quite a while. But it also makes me think should Apple stop selling older Pro models sooner or is it better that they keep them around for people who don‚Äôt want to spend a fortune on the latest one?\n\nSo, how old is your iPhone, and how is it holding up these days?",

But I started to notice that the much-praised battery life didn't live up to its claims after six months, and I decided that my next iPhone would be the compact 6.3-inch model. I even planned to switch to the 16 Pro, but decided to wait for the 17 series. And now I see these new Pros, Air, and base model. I tried the Pro, and it felt crappy to me. The Air feels like something premium, but $1000 for a phone with one speaker, a lousy battery, and one camera seemed like too irrational a choice to me. I took a chance and got the 17. 256 GB of memory, 120 HZ, thin bezels ‚Äî I was impressed by this model. It has ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING that ordinary people need. As for the battery, it lasts me until nighttime, and the screen shows 7.5-8 hours of screen time. The 2x camera zoom is more than enough for me, and I am completely satisfied with this phone in all aspects! White is mine and got sage for wife",

No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well.

    "title": "Android Verified Boot and the Bootloader Unlock Security Theater",
    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

    "selftext": "It's too much of a coincidence that ONEPLUS has not only downgraded the camera specs but also ditched Hassleblad partnership while OPPO is going all out with strong focus on camera and overall specs/features with the Find X9 series. Oneplus could have just as easily kept the same camera hardware in OP15 as OP13 which would have been good enough for 2026 with proper tuning but they didn't.\n\nAlso, from the display specs the focus is mostly on performance and high refresh rates now.\n\nOneplus flagships are known for VFM with balanced specs but from now on I think the focus is shifting towards to performance/gaming so basically it's minus -1 point from the camera department and +1 point in the performance department.\n\nI strongly believe, from now on ONEPLUS is likely to become a gaming orientated brand and OPPO will be the main balanced brand like IQOO and VIVO, POCO/REDMI and XIAOMI.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEdit: Appending the camera downgrade info below\n\nMain camera: LYT 808 ‚Üí LYT 700 (same as Nord5)\n\nTelephoto: OV64B ‚Üí JN5",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point üòÖ, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol üòÖ)",

I created an app that helps you to keep track of all your data in one simple place.\n\n# Download\n\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franko.privacyguard)\n\nI first released it 4 years ago, but Google removed it stating it violates the terms of use. Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I‚Äôve been working on something I‚Äôm really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It‚Äôs a great feature, but it‚Äôs locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built¬†**MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to¬†**any Android phone running Android 9 or above**¬†‚Äî including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt‚Äôs still in early access and I‚Äôd love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper)¬†\n\nThis is just the beginning - I‚Äôm actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you‚Äôre into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I‚Äôd really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I‚Äôve been working on something I‚Äôm really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It‚Äôs a great feature, but it‚Äôs locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built¬†**MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to¬†**any Android phone running Android 9 or above**¬†‚Äî including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt‚Äôs still in early access and I‚Äôd love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper)¬†\n\nThis is just the beginning - I‚Äôm actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you‚Äôre into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I‚Äôd really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "What is wrong with Pixel phones??\n\nMy wife has a Pixel 9 Pro XL and all seemed fine until 2 months ago. Her RCS stopped working unless the app was open. When it's closed or in the background it won't deliver so everything eventually comes through sms/mms.\n\nI wiped her phone which didn't fix it. Reverted back to Android 15 and that still didn't fix the RCS issue. So updated back to 16 and said to disable RCS so she can get texts on time.\n\nNow ever since she got the phone setup from the multiple wipes it will not get notifications at all for multiple apps the major ones for her being Snapchat, Facebook and Ring.\n\nThis is so infuriating.

I'm near the end of my contract so might just push through instead of sending it off to get fixed. \n\nMy question is. Do all pixel phones run the risk of this green screen issue? I've seen some mention it being a thing with the 7s. I had a 6 before getting my current 8 and didn't get it on that. Mostly wondering whether to risk getting another pixel phone, don't want to be dealing with this issue again. ",

The shoe was \\~5 inches from the phone camera and her face(\\~5 feet away) was completely blurred out due to the bokeh. This was intentional and exactly the effect I wanted. I took the pic and it looked fine so I moved on. 2 days later I went back to look at it, and it has horrifyingly sharpened her face and her features look reminiscent of the old DALL-E mini ai generated images and the picture now has the \"Face Unblur\" tag in google photos. \n\nHow can I remove this or revert it back to what it was? It looks awful and is not at all what I wanted. Additionally, can I turn this feature off? If it's not going to work (I have 100s of blurry photos) then I don't think I want it on.\n\nThank you in advance!",

In any case, I presume the handset price wouldn't drop down beyond the RRP of the current free gift the Pixel Buds - ¬£219?\nIf it did drop down by around ¬£200 for Black Friday I would rather go for that than the current free Buds offer, if it was only like ¬£100 then I would rather just take the Buds now instead.\n\nI don't have anything to trade in, so enhanced trade in offers would make no difference to me, so if that's all they end up doing for Black Friday I would have been better off with the current deal. \n\nI guess what I need from you all is reassurance that Google/other reputable retailers have a consistent history of dropping the Pixel handset price by at least ¬£200 every Black Friday, is there a consistent track record of this? \n\nMany many thanks!",

About 20 minutes in, android auto disconnects. No biggie, I'm used to it disconnecting, not sure if it's a pixel, android auto, cable, or Ford thing. Either way, I noticed it wasn't due to a bad connection, the phone had rebooted? Weird, a couple minutes goes by and it happens again.\n\nThis time I keep my eyes on the phone to see what's going on, and it looked like Gemini was being pulled up. I then turn off microphone access cause I was thinking maybe my audio book was triggering some weird \"turn off\" microphone command. Well then my phone acts even stranger. Reboots again and this time whenever I press the sleep button, it opens up the camera and then proceeds to prompt me to unblock the microphone, then it pulls up Gemini again. This literally repeats 4 or 5 times before I get freaked out and put it in airplane mode as a precaution. I get to work and turn off airplane mode and it hasn't occured since. \n\nI don't think it's hacking but it really felt like my phone was not listening to my commands and someone else was taking over the screen and trying to run Gemini. Anyone else see this behavior before? ",

If you want to use AI, it is Gemini or CPU rendering.\n\nQualcomm in other hand, does not advertise it much but you can take any high-end Qualcomm chipset and run local AI models in 1/100 the time due NPU acceleration (QNN)\n\nI have a 2022 old Sony phone, and I can produce AI images in 5 seconds while my Pixel 9 Pro takes almost almost 2 minutes due CPU processing.\n\n\\--\n\nBefore someone comes to talk to me about the miracles/horrors of Google AI Gallery or LiteRT, I think this is still bare-bones. You can see at their github page, they promote Google Tensor as \"Coming soon\".\n\nEdge Torch - The tool doing LLM model conversion - refers itself as \"broad CPU coverage, with **initial** GPU and NPU support\". This project started a year ago.\n\nThis to me is surprising, again, considering Google broadly talking about AI into Pixel phones but having nothing (except own made solutions), and Qualcomm talking very little about own phone chipsets but supporting most of their high-end devices for a while.",

It makes the phone feel quite thick in the hand and in the pocket.\nDoes anyone have good recommendations for a truly thin case?\n\nMy main priorities are:\nVery slim profile (minimal bulk)\nGood for scratch protection\nDecent grip (not super slippery)\nPixel Snap\n\nI'm less concerned with heavy-duty drop protection and more focused on preserving the phone's original form factor. What are your top picks for slim cases?",

Yesterday in my car (wireless Android Auto) I took a call through the AA menu, and instead of playing sound through the car, it played it on my phone. My phone thought in the target selection of the phone app, that it was connected to the car. I had to end the call and call back for it to work properly. Today while I was in my car I joined a Teams call, and it did not play through the car, but again through the phone. Then after I've left my car, I put in my PIxel Buds Pro 2, but instead on switching to it, it switched to my Pixel Watch 2. I've removed my buds and put them back a couple of times, but it did not help, it always played through my watch. It did not happen with media playback yet, so it seems to be call related, but both the phone and Teams. Has anyone experience this?",

I have Google Home with camera notifications and cradlewise for baby notifications and all the notifications are delayed. Often I would unlock the phone and see a flurry of notifications from Google Home about camera activity popping up. Funny enough, these notifications are not time stamped to when the phone was unlocked, but when the event happened. So it is super common for a Google Home notification to pop up with 30 mins ago written on it. Same happens with other apps too. \n\nI have turned off the adaptive battery, have the Google Home and other apps allowed unrestricted access to battery, but nothing seems to work. I had a Pixel 8a and a Pixel 7 before this and never had the issue on them. \n\nNot sure if it is a faulty device or a software bug. ",

    "selftext": "I'd like to buy a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and am trying to decide whether any Black Friday deals in just a few weeks time will actually be any better than what is currently being offered now. \nOn the Google Store right now the Pixel 10 Pro XL does not have any direct reductions in the price of the handset, but there is the offer of them coming with a free pair of Pixel Buds Pro 2, an offer which ends in 2 days time. \nCan anyone please help enlighten me on what Google usually do with their offers on Black Friday, is it usually more along the lines of a direct price drop off of the handset rather than 'free gifts'. In any case, I presume the handset price wouldn't drop down beyond the RRP of the current free gift the Pixel Buds - ¬£219?\nIf it did drop down by around ¬£200 for Black Friday I would rather go for that than the current free Buds offer, if it was only like ¬£100 then I would rather just take the Buds now instead.\n\nI don't have anything to trade in, so enhanced trade in offers would make no difference to me, so if that's all they end up doing for Black Friday I would have been better off with the current deal. \n\nI guess what I need from you all is reassurance that Google/other reputable retailers have a consistent history of dropping the Pixel handset price by at least ¬£200 every Black Friday, is there a consistent track record of this? \n\nMany many thanks!",

Why on Earth would that be a thing? They should be separate so I can decide for myself. Is there a way around this? I don't believe I've had this problem with any other phone.\n\nI get more important text messages than I do calls, 90% of the calls I get are from scammers, and anything else I tend to let go to voicemail anyway, I'd really like to mute those while keeping my notification/text message sound on.

    "selftext": "Upgrading from a Note 10+ (loved the phone but half the screen no longer reacts to touch, only s pen unfortunately) decided to trial run both the s24 ultra (1TB) & S25+ (512GB) before finalizing which to keep, the other goes back. Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

(The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra?

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve never been a big fan of Samsung electronics. Didn‚Äôt have anything against them per se, but I just wasn‚Äôt often impressed by them. I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I‚Äôm absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I‚Äôm there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this sound bar isn‚Äôt quite on the same level as my old system was, but it‚Äôs probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799.

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve used the S22 Ultra before and really liked the design and One UI, even though the battery life wasn‚Äôt the best. Now I‚Äôm looking at the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra and wanted to hear from people who‚Äôve spent time with them.\n\nOn paper they seem very close, but I‚Äôm curious about how they actually feel day to day. How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra‚Äôs S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who‚Äôs been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

I caught it before it hit bottom, immediately turned it off, and hung it ports down above a fan (I read that it will dry better in open air than in rice), but it's not looking good.   It may have been water resistant enough to survive a quick dunk when it was new, but the years apparently degraded that.   It's been hanging above the fan for 5 days and counting, and this morning it still wouldn't turn on, and when I plug it in it shows the charging icon for about 3 seconds, then nothing.\n\nSo why am I telling you this in r/GalaxyWatch ?    Because I got an S25 Ultra to replace it, but I had to reset my GW3 to connect it to the S25 Ultra, and I lost my favorite watchface (pay no attention to the 8% battery.... I stole someone else's picture of the watchface.)\n\nI'd thought a little about upgrading the GW3, but it's about 32nd on the list, since the GW3 still does everything I want it to do.   With support for Tizen ending, I may need to move it up on my list?\n\nSo I'm wondering if the Bluestealth watchface (or something very like it) is available for newer Galaxy watches?\n\nI still have my OG Galaxy Watch in a drawer, I haven't reset it, and it still has the Bluestealth watchface.   Is there any way to recover the watchface from the OG GW to the GW3 to at least tide me over until I decide to upgrade to a newer watch?",

It turns out that there is a maximum number of alarms you can have in your Alarm app. I deleted all my alarms and tried setting a new one again, and it worked without any errors.\n\nI discovered this because when I attempted to set an alarm using Bixby, it informed me that I had reached the maximum number of alarms. However, when using Gemini, it simply gives an \"UNKNOWN ERROR\" message, even though it behaves as if the alarm was set. If you're not checking the watch display after asking Gemini, you might not even realize there's been an error.\n\nThanks to everyone who tried to help me earlier!",

My current watch is a simple FitBit Versa 3 (so any Galaxy watch will be an upgrade lol).\n\n- I mainly wish to use the watch as an extension of my phone (texting, calling, music control, etc) with my phone nearby, so the LTE function won't be a necessity.\n\n- The main secondary purpose I need my watch for is fitness tracking: Tracking heart rate, steps, calories, distance, etc.\n\nI am on the fence right now. I have found a 47mm Galaxy 6 Classic for quite a good deal ($109 for the bluetooth OR LTE model), and that is the model I'm leaning towards. But before I buy, I want to know if paying an extra $100-$150 for the Galaxy 7 would be worth it for any newer specs or features that it has. \n\nI won't be using my watch as much for temperature tracking and GPS purposes (beyond tracking running/biking distance which I can also have my phone on me for). \n\nI also dont plan to download a ton of apps (mainly the defaults, a few interchangable watch faces, timer, calorie tracking, metronome, Spotify control, and possibly 1 or 2 games) so I'm unsure of how much of an impact the 16GB to 32GB difference would make on my satisfaction with either one. \n\nPlease, any insight, advice, and experience would be greatly appreciated!

    "selftext": "Hello all, im just wondering if anyone has had this experience since the OneUI 8 update. Now, i will clarify a few things:\n\n1. I use the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024)\n2. I've had the update for about 2-3 months\n\nI recently started running again, I started taking it seriously back in June (pre-update). When I was running then, I would do as I still do today; start the 'Running' exercise on Samsung Health (on the watch) and crack on. The activity face would report my live pace and report the split every km - if I ran at a  6:00/km then the split readout wouldn't report a 6:00/km pace.\n\nHowever, since the last major update (OneUI 8) on the watch, the live pace has been way off. This is my current experience: I start the 'Running' activity I crack on and check the live pace its reading 6:30. When I hit the first split and the readout occurs, its reading ~30s faster such as 'lap pace, 5:57/km' - and this is the split that is recorded after I finish the activity. So what has happened to the live readings? It's been like this for months, at this point, i am just used to it and just use the incorrect live pace, knowing what it is roughly and just read the split readout for the correct information. Has anyone else experienced this, from OneUI 7 > OneUI 8? I don't know if this is Watch Ultra specific issue or across the product range.\n\nTLDR: Live running pace used to be relatively accurate, since One UI 8 update, the live pace is reported as a much slower pace than what the actual pace is.",

    "selftext": "I have been a long time smartwatch user and have tried a lot of brands. I have mostly settled on Samsung and Amazfit but each is missing something. This is short wish list of changes for Galaxy watches:\n\n  \n1) **let me swipe away individual notifications**. Right now, I have to clear all of them at once, or tap on each one and clear it. I would rather just swipe from the list to do some quick triaging;\n\n2) **improve the step count deduping** between watch and phone. Right now it really seems to overcount, so I just turn off step counting on my phone, which is a shame because it would be nice to track some steps while my watch is charging\n\n3) **add Energy Score to the Galaxy Fit 3.** that would make it a great companion to the Galaxy watch. I could wear it at night for seemless tracking. I also prefer it for some sports where I want a smaller, lighter device and I dont need GPS\n\n  \n4) **Make message replies via voice faster**. On Amazfit, I can tap the notification, then hold down a button to active the voice assistant and can directly dictate. On WearOS, it takes a lot of taps to do that (tap the notification, open on watch, reply, keyboard, swipe up to select different keyboards, tap the microphone icon)\n\n  \n5) **consider swiping up for notifications and using both left and right swipes to access tiles**. That lets me get at my 2 most important tiles with a single swipe.\n\n  \n5a) *bonus* \\- **consider a shortcut tile**. Amazfit does this well and has it as a list you can scroll through. Galaxy watches have this a bit with the new tile designs but it still caps at 4.\n\n\n\nThese are just my thoughts. Maybe it's just me :)",

    "selftext": "Ever since I updated my Watch7 to One UI 8, I‚Äôve had issues twice with the auto-pause feature during workouts (something that never happened before on the previous version).\n\nYesterday I went for a bike ride and stopped midway to chat with a friend. The watch correctly paused the workout, but when we started moving again, I noticed later that it never resumed tracking. Result: I lost a big chunk of my ride data.\n\nToday, I went cycling again and took a short break. The watch paused as expected. When I started riding back home, I remembered the issue from yesterday and checked: it was still paused, even though I was already moving. I manually resumed it and finished the ride, but when I got home, I saw that it tracked the time of my return but didn‚Äôt record the route on the map. So the saved activity shows double the duration and only half the distance, ending exactly where it paused during my break.\n\nNot sure if a factory reset would fix this. For now, I‚Äôll try disabling auto-pause and rely on manual pausing/unpausing, hoping it doesn‚Äôt bug out again. Otherwise, I might have to ditch Samsung Health and just record directly on Strava.\n\nAnyone else running into this issue?",

I cannot get it to connect to my cmf phone 2 pro. What I tried:\n\n\\- clear cache and all data on galaxy wear (I've had a Samsung fit3 before)\n\n\\- completly reinstall the galaxy wear app\n\n\\- I have galaxy watch 7 plugin installed (as the wear app requested it)\n\n\\- I restarted both my phone and the watch\n\n\\- I tried multiple times, with and without logging into a samsung acount, accepting automatic updated and declining them.\n\n\\- I removed the watch from my bluetooth paired devices list\n\nHere's the steps that lead me to the issue:\n\n\\- I turn on my watch\n\n\\- I open galaxy wear app\n\n\\- I add new device\n\n\\- I press on Galaxy watch ultra under detected devices list\n\n\\- I press \"pair\" after confirming the code from the screen on the android pairing popup\n\n\\- It sometimes asks me if I want to log into samsung, I skip this step for now (same was happening when I logged in)\n\n\\- I agree to terms of service and other stuff\n\n\\- The app throws me back to my homescreen and when I want to come back to it, it shows scanning for available devices in galaxy wear app. \n\nI would really appreciate any help with that issue. The official samsung support is currently unavailable since it's Sunday, but judging by how hard it was to find the phone number or live chat link and fight with AI assistant to conn3ect me with human I can only hope they will help. \n\nI can post the full video of the steps I take if my internet-taught english isn't that good. \n\nAlso if my post dosen't fit the subreddit, I would really appreciate if you could point me to a right page, and I will immidietly delete this post.

The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time. Later I found a work around, you need to open Samsung Health app on your phone then select the activity again which kinda resets the screen, but this is such a hassle to do mid ride when you can't even see the time.

    "selftext": "So...... my phone (S21 Ultra) took a dive in a swimming pool.   I caught it before it hit bottom, immediately turned it off, and hung it ports down above a fan (I read that it will dry better in open air than in rice), but it's not looking good.   It may have been water resistant enough to survive a quick dunk when it was new, but the years apparently degraded that.   It's been hanging above the fan for 5 days and counting, and this morning it still wouldn't turn on, and when I plug it in it shows the charging icon for about 3 seconds, then nothing.\n\nSo why am I telling you this in r/GalaxyWatch ?    Because I got an S25 Ultra to replace it, but I had to reset my GW3 to connect it to the S25 Ultra, and I lost my favorite watchface (pay no attention to the 8% battery.... I stole someone else's picture of the watchface.)\n\nI'd thought a little about upgrading the GW3, but it's about 32nd on the list, since the GW3 still does everything I want it to do.   With support for Tizen ending, I may need to move it up on my list?\n\nSo I'm wondering if the Bluestealth watchface (or something very like it) is available for newer Galaxy watches?\n\nI still have my OG Galaxy Watch in a drawer, I haven't reset it, and it still has the Bluestealth watchface.   Is there any way to recover the watchface from the OG GW to the GW3 to at least tide me over until I decide to upgrade to a newer watch?",

It turns out that there is a maximum number of alarms you can have in your Alarm app. I deleted all my alarms and tried setting a new one again, and it worked without any errors.\n\nI discovered this because when I attempted to set an alarm using Bixby, it informed me that I had reached the maximum number of alarms. However, when using Gemini, it simply gives an \"UNKNOWN ERROR\" message, even though it behaves as if the alarm was set. If you're not checking the watch display after asking Gemini, you might not even realize there's been an error.\n\nThanks to everyone who tried to help me earlier!",

    "selftext": "Hello all, im just wondering if anyone has had this experience since the OneUI 8 update. Now, i will clarify a few things:\n\n1. I use the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024)\n2. I've had the update for about 2-3 months\n\nI recently started running again, I started taking it seriously back in June (pre-update). When I was running then, I would do as I still do today; start the 'Running' exercise on Samsung Health (on the watch) and crack on. The activity face would report my live pace and report the split every km - if I ran at a  6:00/km then the split readout wouldn't report a 6:00/km pace.\n\nHowever, since the last major update (OneUI 8) on the watch, the live pace has been way off. This is my current experience: I start the 'Running' activity I crack on and check the live pace its reading 6:30. When I hit the first split and the readout occurs, its reading ~30s faster such as 'lap pace, 5:57/km' - and this is the split that is recorded after I finish the activity. So what has happened to the live readings? It's been like this for months, at this point, i am just used to it and just use the incorrect live pace, knowing what it is roughly and just read the split readout for the correct information. Has anyone else experienced this, from OneUI 7 > OneUI 8? I don't know if this is Watch Ultra specific issue or across the product range.\n\nTLDR: Live running pace used to be relatively accurate, since One UI 8 update, the live pace is reported as a much slower pace than what the actual pace is.",

    "selftext": "Hey y'all! I'm thinking of buying my first Galaxy Watch, and I need some help deciding. \n\nFor background: \n\n- I use a Galaxy S23 phone and Galaxy Buds 2. My current watch is a simple FitBit Versa 3 (so any Galaxy watch will be an upgrade lol).\n\n- I mainly wish to use the watch as an extension of my phone (texting, calling, music control, etc) with my phone nearby, so the LTE function won't be a necessity.\n\n- The main secondary purpose I need my watch for is fitness tracking: Tracking heart rate, steps, calories, distance, etc.\n\nI am on the fence right now. I have found a 47mm Galaxy 6 Classic for quite a good deal ($109 for the bluetooth OR LTE model), and that is the model I'm leaning towards. But before I buy, I want to know if paying an extra $100-$150 for the Galaxy 7 would be worth it for any newer specs or features that it has. \n\nI won't be using my watch as much for temperature tracking and GPS purposes (beyond tracking running/biking distance which I can also have my phone on me for). \n\nI also dont plan to download a ton of apps (mainly the defaults, a few interchangable watch faces, timer, calorie tracking, metronome, Spotify control, and possibly 1 or 2 games) so I'm unsure of how much of an impact the 16GB to 32GB difference would make on my satisfaction with either one. \n\nPlease, any insight, advice, and experience would be greatly appreciated!

    "selftext": "I have been a long time smartwatch user and have tried a lot of brands. I have mostly settled on Samsung and Amazfit but each is missing something. This is short wish list of changes for Galaxy watches:\n\n  \n1) **let me swipe away individual notifications**. Right now, I have to clear all of them at once, or tap on each one and clear it. I would rather just swipe from the list to do some quick triaging;\n\n2) **improve the step count deduping** between watch and phone. Right now it really seems to overcount, so I just turn off step counting on my phone, which is a shame because it would be nice to track some steps while my watch is charging\n\n3) **add Energy Score to the Galaxy Fit 3.** that would make it a great companion to the Galaxy watch. I could wear it at night for seemless tracking. I also prefer it for some sports where I want a smaller, lighter device and I dont need GPS\n\n  \n4) **Make message replies via voice faster**. On Amazfit, I can tap the notification, then hold down a button to active the voice assistant and can directly dictate. On WearOS, it takes a lot of taps to do that (tap the notification, open on watch, reply, keyboard, swipe up to select different keyboards, tap the microphone icon)\n\n  \n5) **consider swiping up for notifications and using both left and right swipes to access tiles**. That lets me get at my 2 most important tiles with a single swipe.\n\n  \n5a) *bonus* \\- **consider a shortcut tile**. Amazfit does this well and has it as a list you can scroll through. Galaxy watches have this a bit with the new tile designs but it still caps at 4.\n\n\n\nThese are just my thoughts. Maybe it's just me :)",

    "selftext": "So...... my phone (S21 Ultra) took a dive in a swimming pool.   I caught it before it hit bottom, immediately turned it off, and hung it ports down above a fan (I read that it will dry better in open air than in rice), but it's not looking good.   It may have been water resistant enough to survive a quick dunk when it was new, but the years apparently degraded that.   It's been hanging above the fan for 5 days and counting, and this morning it still wouldn't turn on, and when I plug it in it shows the charging icon for about 3 seconds, then nothing.\n\nSo why am I telling you this in r/GalaxyWatch ?    Because I got an S25 Ultra to replace it, but I had to reset my GW3 to connect it to the S25 Ultra, and I lost my favorite watchface (pay no attention to the 8% battery.... I stole someone else's picture of the watchface.)\n\nI'd thought a little about upgrading the GW3, but it's about 32nd on the list, since the GW3 still does everything I want it to do.   With support for Tizen ending, I may need to move it up on my list?\n\nSo I'm wondering if the Bluestealth watchface (or something very like it) is available for newer Galaxy watches?\n\nI still have my OG Galaxy Watch in a drawer, I haven't reset it, and it still has the Bluestealth watchface.   Is there any way to recover the watchface from the OG GW to the GW3 to at least tide me over until I decide to upgrade to a newer watch?",

It turns out that there is a maximum number of alarms you can have in your Alarm app. I deleted all my alarms and tried setting a new one again, and it worked without any errors.\n\nI discovered this because when I attempted to set an alarm using Bixby, it informed me that I had reached the maximum number of alarms. However, when using Gemini, it simply gives an \"UNKNOWN ERROR\" message, even though it behaves as if the alarm was set. If you're not checking the watch display after asking Gemini, you might not even realize there's been an error.\n\nThanks to everyone who tried to help me earlier!",

    "title": "\"Laptop On Rails\" - A new approach to laptop cooling. 2025 idea -> 2025 solution.",
    "selftext": "Finally we made something that works great! Hello, and thank you all for so many views and likes and comments under my previous posts. We got 100k views on my 2 previous posts relating to my ideas for solution.\n\nI had the same problem of overheating laptop, even on low CPU usage, so I was trying every market available solution. I already had a cooling pad, that I bought from one platform. But it was so bad, that i put it away to collect dust. Cheap plastic and metal mesh, that went completely broken when i collected the luggage from my arrival flight to Bucharest. A loose USB plug that i never knew if it was on or off. Plus I did not like the idea of something that makes my laptop very unstable, lift by an inch from the surface, make my wrists at strange angles, occupate USB, sound strange, and also not be able to \"push\" my laptop further away from me. So for me a laptop stand would be a huge compromise, that I couldn't accept, and opted out.\n\nThe second wide known option is a \"laptop lifter\" - the stand that lifts laptop off the ground. I did not really try it, but by the looks, it also causes one big problem: It gives an impression of \"Quake\" (i call it a visual concept, a braintrap, where I feel like being inside the Quake game, where you look at the objects at strange angles, and the game Quake and it's 3d engine, is know for strange 3D FOV) - So you need to see your laptop keyboard at unnatural angle which distracts you from work on the computer, plus laptop is also \"lift\" from the table, causing a static gravity object to become somehow \"in air\" and for my brain, it was simply to much to think of trying it out. Plus, you also can't use your touchpad (I use it a lot, i got 4-fingers shortcuts assigned to volume up/down), you need to buy an extra keyboard, etc, etc.\n\nSo what i did, i just simply created \"rails\" that push the notebook further away.\n\nThe problems it solves:\n\n\\- 100% passive cooling\n\n\\- air flows freely, lot of space\n\n\\- very stable\n\n\\- hands lay \"painocomfy\"\n\n\\- moving your hands horizontally, at natural angle on the keyboaard\n\n\\- USB port freed\n\n\\- no \"Quake effect\"\n\n\\- 0 heat onto table\n\n\\- proper sitting position\n\n\\- using my laptop keyboard that i am used to\n\n\\- can attach extra devices on laptop (2 heavy mobile phones on the photo)\n\n\\- a lot of space for books, dinners, \n\n\\- quick attachment/ detachment system\n\n\\- easy to detach, without destroying the surface of the table\n\n\\- and more.\n\nI understand that many of you might be used to keep your table on the wall, but for me it was a choice: \"either i keep smoking my laptop, or i just pull the table away this 10 cm and chill\"\n\nPS: I invented also 3 other new cooling methods, plus 1 cooling system specifically for using laptops in a bed. I already got working prototypes of these three, so stay tuned...\n\nFeel free to ask questions about the \"Laptop on Rails\" viral project and if you think it is cool or do you stand by standard and commercial solutions!",

    "selftext": "Hello !  \n5 years ago I bought a Yoga Slim 7-14ARE05 Laptop (ideapad) - Type 82A2 and it has been a blast. It has perfectly fullfilled what I was expecting it to do which is :  \n\\- coding (low level programming like kernel stuff and a bit of AI running)  \n\\- movies/series  \n\\- small gaming on not so demanding games like World Of Tanks or League of Legends\n\nPlus I thought it looked really cool with the metal case.\n\nHowever I am now looking to buy a new one and can't manage to find another one that fits as well as it did, eventhough it was 5 years ago. I went through the Lenovo store and didn't manage to see something that looked to be as good, but maybe I overlooked something.  \nI'm not sure to want a Macbook either since I got comfortable on PCs (and need a decent amount of storage)  \nMy price range can go at maximum to 1200.\n\nWould anyone have any recommandations ?",

    "selftext": "Hi guys, so it's time for an upgrade for me and I'm kinda lost. Here's what i need from a laptop:\n\n\\- not to be an Apple product\n\n\\- 14'', ideally 16x10, with refresh rate >60hz, and nits enough to work in a sunlit room\n\n\\- decent CPU performance - mostly for programming, big projects on Go, Rust etc., some docker containers, that kind of stuff\n\n\\- 32 Gb of RAM or more\n\n\\- reasonable battery life - ideally i need it to last 8 hours, even if that would be in battery saving mode\n\n\\- usb-c with PD and DP for an external monitor\n\n\\- as lightweight as possible considering the battery life\n\n\\- as silent as possible\n\nNow i work on Asus Zenbook 14 UM3402Y with Ryzen 7730U and 16 Gb RAM so it's a low bar for a new one to overcome.  But i like how lightweight and silent it is - after changing thermal goo for a better one it just doesn't turn fans at all, except heavy loads. Also the battery life is ok. That was the reason i sticked with it for like two years.\n\nI don't care for premium materials, sound, chassis flex, one-handed opening or pretty much anything aside the specs i mentioned. The price is also not REALLY a stopping factor, but of course if there is a chance not to splurge I'd gladly would.\n\nI also looked at something like Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 with 5070Ti. I understand that it comes with discrete GPU downsides like weight, heat, noise, and low battery life (and small formfactor downsides like low allowed TDP), but it still looks tempting ngl. Maybe someone with similar use cases had to try that one or something similar like Razer Blade and have something to say about it?\n\nThanks in advance for everyone in this thread.",

I've taken it to two repair shops both had no clue what might be wrong with it as they couldn't get it to boot either.\n\nI've tried everything I know that might help such as a general clean, taking out ram sticks and ssd putting it back in, disconnecting the battery putting it back, same thing with CMOS battery and neither seem dead checking with a multimeter, tried to turn on plugged into power with no battery, drained the battery charged it again and all that. After all the things I've tried my guess would be somehow a faulty motherboard, or some kind of bios update that started while I wasn't in the room and screwed up halfway through but I have no idea.\n\nI'm not certain what these black texter marks signify on certain screws and the battery connector, but does anyone know if something is wrong with this part here? (**1st picture with yellow arrow**) To me I can't tell if it's just texter, possibly that that's the way these ones are (a little darker, smaller or missing) or they do kind of look to me like it possibly short circuited. If any thing else looks fishy please do tell as I might have unknowingly reconnected something improperly or something dumb, but to me that's the only part that I kind think looks odd.\n\nGenerally speaking I believe I took good care of it wouldn't let it get too hot while gaming, would take breaks, used a little angled laptop riser so it should've have had decent airflow all the time, I would never leave it on overnight or while leaving the house for hours, never overclocked or anything like that I don't know how or sure if it even can. It had a 2 year warranty from Centre Com but I had it for almost 3 years, this did occur early last year (only just took the pictures) Also was just running windows 11.

Asked what it could be on another reddit like 2 weeks ago, but couldn't do any remplacement before going home at the end of November. Since this first question, screen got worse and now I'm experiencing a full block.\nFirst thread ended up at \"probably the cable\", but I'm kinda doubting since it's got to this worse. It used to be some lines not instant sync with current situation, not just black as it is now.\nAnd for info, the laptop display is fully working though hdmi on a tv, so it's only the laptop screen having that.",

List which programs/games you desire to run.** \n \nGaming with Steam and GOG, light video editing with Capcut and eventually DiVinci, and game dev with Unity and Godot\n \n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**\n \n Minecraft, Subnautica, Terraria, Deltarune, all atleast 60fps, not picky.\n \n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** \n \n I want a decent handful of ports, and touch screen.\n \n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**\n \nI come from a MacBook M1 Air if it helps whatsoever, so I am used to that.\nI also dont want another mac. I'd prefer a windows laptop. My preferences, not yours, dont try and \"sway\" me otherwise.",

I'm in Sam Francisco, there are many engineers here, I personally have never opened up a laptop.\n\nI saw laptops with 8tb upgrades but we're rtx 4 series not 5 with my budget up to 2-2.5k. I'm really torn so many companies so mmy did configurations. It's getting hard to keep up. I need it to work for 3 years to edit videos, I'm a nomad. I want to live stream, play, and run softwares. My LG 2018 is on its last leg.",

That‚Äôs what brought me harem.\nIs it really worth it? What solid alternatives would you recommend?\n\nAlso, would getting a powerful laptop (which one?) plus a separate drawing tablet be a smarter choice?\n\nThanks again for any help or insights you can share! :)",

I myself don't really care for how well it can run AAA or heavier games, but to be capable to run Visual Studio, Excel and Clip Studio with no issue would be enough.\n\nThanks a lot for helping me in advance",

    "title": "\"Laptop On Rails\" - A new approach to laptop cooling. 2025 idea -> 2025 solution.",
    "selftext": "Finally we made something that works great! Hello, and thank you all for so many views and likes and comments under my previous posts. We got 100k views on my 2 previous posts relating to my ideas for solution.\n\nI had the same problem of overheating laptop, even on low CPU usage, so I was trying every market available solution. I already had a cooling pad, that I bought from one platform. But it was so bad, that i put it away to collect dust. Cheap plastic and metal mesh, that went completely broken when i collected the luggage from my arrival flight to Bucharest. A loose USB plug that i never knew if it was on or off. Plus I did not like the idea of something that makes my laptop very unstable, lift by an inch from the surface, make my wrists at strange angles, occupate USB, sound strange, and also not be able to \"push\" my laptop further away from me. So for me a laptop stand would be a huge compromise, that I couldn't accept, and opted out.\n\nThe second wide known option is a \"laptop lifter\" - the stand that lifts laptop off the ground. I did not really try it, but by the looks, it also causes one big problem: It gives an impression of \"Quake\" (i call it a visual concept, a braintrap, where I feel like being inside the Quake game, where you look at the objects at strange angles, and the game Quake and it's 3d engine, is know for strange 3D FOV) - So you need to see your laptop keyboard at unnatural angle which distracts you from work on the computer, plus laptop is also \"lift\" from the table, causing a static gravity object to become somehow \"in air\" and for my brain, it was simply to much to think of trying it out. Plus, you also can't use your touchpad (I use it a lot, i got 4-fingers shortcuts assigned to volume up/down), you need to buy an extra keyboard, etc, etc.\n\nSo what i did, i just simply created \"rails\" that push the notebook further away.\n\nThe problems it solves:\n\n\\- 100% passive cooling\n\n\\- air flows freely, lot of space\n\n\\- very stable\n\n\\- hands lay \"painocomfy\"\n\n\\- moving your hands horizontally, at natural angle on the keyboaard\n\n\\- USB port freed\n\n\\- no \"Quake effect\"\n\n\\- 0 heat onto table\n\n\\- proper sitting position\n\n\\- using my laptop keyboard that i am used to\n\n\\- can attach extra devices on laptop (2 heavy mobile phones on the photo)\n\n\\- a lot of space for books, dinners, \n\n\\- quick attachment/ detachment system\n\n\\- easy to detach, without destroying the surface of the table\n\n\\- and more.\n\nI understand that many of you might be used to keep your table on the wall, but for me it was a choice: \"either i keep smoking my laptop, or i just pull the table away this 10 cm and chill\"\n\nPS: I invented also 3 other new cooling methods, plus 1 cooling system specifically for using laptops in a bed. I already got working prototypes of these three, so stay tuned...\n\nFeel free to ask questions about the \"Laptop on Rails\" viral project and if you think it is cool or do you stand by standard and commercial solutions!",

I went through the Lenovo store and didn't manage to see something that looked to be as good, but maybe I overlooked something.  \nI'm not sure to want a Macbook either since I got comfortable on PCs (and need a decent amount of storage)  \nMy price range can go at maximum to 1200.\n\nWould anyone have any recommandations ?",

    "selftext": "Hi guys, so it's time for an upgrade for me and I'm kinda lost. Here's what i need from a laptop:\n\n\\- not to be an Apple product\n\n\\- 14'', ideally 16x10, with refresh rate >60hz, and nits enough to work in a sunlit room\n\n\\- decent CPU performance - mostly for programming, big projects on Go, Rust etc., some docker containers, that kind of stuff\n\n\\- 32 Gb of RAM or more\n\n\\- reasonable battery life - ideally i need it to last 8 hours, even if that would be in battery saving mode\n\n\\- usb-c with PD and DP for an external monitor\n\n\\- as lightweight as possible considering the battery life\n\n\\- as silent as possible\n\nNow i work on Asus Zenbook 14 UM3402Y with Ryzen 7730U and 16 Gb RAM so it's a low bar for a new one to overcome.  But i like how lightweight and silent it is - after changing thermal goo for a better one it just doesn't turn fans at all, except heavy loads. Also the battery life is ok. That was the reason i sticked with it for like two years.\n\nI don't care for premium materials, sound, chassis flex, one-handed opening or pretty much anything aside the specs i mentioned. The price is also not REALLY a stopping factor, but of course if there is a chance not to splurge I'd gladly would.\n\nI also looked at something like Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 with 5070Ti. I understand that it comes with discrete GPU downsides like weight, heat, noise, and low battery life (and small formfactor downsides like low allowed TDP), but it still looks tempting ngl. Maybe someone with similar use cases had to try that one or something similar like Razer Blade and have something to say about it?\n\nThanks in advance for everyone in this thread.",

I've taken it to two repair shops both had no clue what might be wrong with it as they couldn't get it to boot either.\n\nI've tried everything I know that might help such as a general clean, taking out ram sticks and ssd putting it back in, disconnecting the battery putting it back, same thing with CMOS battery and neither seem dead checking with a multimeter, tried to turn on plugged into power with no battery, drained the battery charged it again and all that. After all the things I've tried my guess would be somehow a faulty motherboard, or some kind of bios update that started while I wasn't in the room and screwed up halfway through but I have no idea.\n\nI'm not certain what these black texter marks signify on certain screws and the battery connector, but does anyone know if something is wrong with this part here? (**1st picture with yellow arrow**) To me I can't tell if it's just texter, possibly that that's the way these ones are (a little darker, smaller or missing) or they do kind of look to me like it possibly short circuited. If any thing else looks fishy please do tell as I might have unknowingly reconnected something improperly or something dumb, but to me that's the only part that I kind think looks odd.\n\nGenerally speaking I believe I took good care of it wouldn't let it get too hot while gaming, would take breaks, used a little angled laptop riser so it should've have had decent airflow all the time, I would never leave it on overnight or while leaving the house for hours, never overclocked or anything like that I don't know how or sure if it even can. It had a 2 year warranty from Centre Com but I had it for almost 3 years, this did occur early last year (only just took the pictures) Also was just running windows 11. Any help would be greatly appreciated, I can provide more pictures and information if asked thank you.\n\n Gigabyte Aorus 15P i7-10750H, RTX 2070 Max-Q, 16 GB RAM, 512GB SSD",

    "title": "\"Laptop On Rails\" - A new approach to laptop cooling. 2025 idea -> 2025 solution.",
    "selftext": "Finally we made something that works great! Hello, and thank you all for so many views and likes and comments under my previous posts. We got 100k views on my 2 previous posts relating to my ideas for solution.\n\nI had the same problem of overheating laptop, even on low CPU usage, so I was trying every market available solution. I already had a cooling pad, that I bought from one platform. But it was so bad, that i put it away to collect dust. Cheap plastic and metal mesh, that went completely broken when i collected the luggage from my arrival flight to Bucharest. A loose USB plug that i never knew if it was on or off. Plus I did not like the idea of something that makes my laptop very unstable, lift by an inch from the surface, make my wrists at strange angles, occupate USB, sound strange, and also not be able to \"push\" my laptop further away from me. So for me a laptop stand would be a huge compromise, that I couldn't accept, and opted out.\n\nThe second wide known option is a \"laptop lifter\" - the stand that lifts laptop off the ground. I did not really try it, but by the looks, it also causes one big problem: It gives an impression of \"Quake\" (i call it a visual concept, a braintrap, where I feel like being inside the Quake game, where you look at the objects at strange angles, and the game Quake and it's 3d engine, is know for strange 3D FOV) - So you need to see your laptop keyboard at unnatural angle which distracts you from work on the computer, plus laptop is also \"lift\" from the table, causing a static gravity object to become somehow \"in air\" and for my brain, it was simply to much to think of trying it out. Plus, you also can't use your touchpad (I use it a lot, i got 4-fingers shortcuts assigned to volume up/down), you need to buy an extra keyboard, etc, etc.\n\nSo what i did, i just simply created \"rails\" that push the notebook further away.\n\nThe problems it solves:\n\n\\- 100% passive cooling\n\n\\- air flows freely, lot of space\n\n\\- very stable\n\n\\- hands lay \"painocomfy\"\n\n\\- moving your hands horizontally, at natural angle on the keyboaard\n\n\\- USB port freed\n\n\\- no \"Quake effect\"\n\n\\- 0 heat onto table\n\n\\- proper sitting position\n\n\\- using my laptop keyboard that i am used to\n\n\\- can attach extra devices on laptop (2 heavy mobile phones on the photo)\n\n\\- a lot of space for books, dinners, \n\n\\- quick attachment/ detachment system\n\n\\- easy to detach, without destroying the surface of the table\n\n\\- and more.\n\nI understand that many of you might be used to keep your table on the wall, but for me it was a choice: \"either i keep smoking my laptop, or i just pull the table away this 10 cm and chill\"\n\nPS: I invented also 3 other new cooling methods, plus 1 cooling system specifically for using laptops in a bed. I already got working prototypes of these three, so stay tuned...\n\nFeel free to ask questions about the \"Laptop on Rails\" viral project and if you think it is cool or do you stand by standard and commercial solutions!",

    "title": "What 14'' should i buy in 2025's end for coding?",
    "selftext": "Hi guys, so it's time for an upgrade for me and I'm kinda lost. Here's what i need from a laptop:\n\n\\- not to be an Apple product\n\n\\- 14'', ideally 16x10, with refresh rate >60hz, and nits enough to work in a sunlit room\n\n\\- decent CPU performance - mostly for programming, big projects on Go, Rust etc., some docker containers, that kind of stuff\n\n\\- 32 Gb of RAM or more\n\n\\- reasonable battery life - ideally i need it to last 8 hours, even if that would be in battery saving mode\n\n\\- usb-c with PD and DP for an external monitor\n\n\\- as lightweight as possible considering the battery life\n\n\\- as silent as possible\n\nNow i work on Asus Zenbook 14 UM3402Y with Ryzen 7730U and 16 Gb RAM so it's a low bar for a new one to overcome.  But i like how lightweight and silent it is - after changing thermal goo for a better one it just doesn't turn fans at all, except heavy loads. Also the battery life is ok. That was the reason i sticked with it for like two years.\n\nI don't care for premium materials, sound, chassis flex, one-handed opening or pretty much anything aside the specs i mentioned. The price is also not REALLY a stopping factor, but of course if there is a chance not to splurge I'd gladly would.\n\nI also looked at something like Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 with 5070Ti. I understand that it comes with discrete GPU downsides like weight, heat, noise, and low battery life (and small formfactor downsides like low allowed TDP), but it still looks tempting ngl. Maybe someone with similar use cases had to try that one or something similar like Razer Blade and have something to say about it?\n\nThanks in advance for everyone in this thread.",

    "selftext": "My computer is about 7 years old at this point and is running into performance issues with modern games that have become very apparent in the last year. Marvel rivals buffers like crazy, cyberpunk buffers on rare occasion, that kind of thing. I actually just got accepted to the marathon playtest, which is pretty awsome, but my pc is struggling at times when a lot is happening and buffers there too. So, basically, what is a good amount of specs to have without breaking the bank? I really don't know much of anything about computers beyond the very very basics. With my limited knowledge, i think I likely need a new graphics card and a ssd. What kind should I get? Or do you think my issue comes from elsewhere?",

So I've had this issue for like 3 days ago, I was playing cs2 when my pc decided to shut down and reboot, and not before letting me listen to the song for a couple more seconds with full speed chassis fans. I also tried running Furmark and the moment I clicked run, the system shut down again. I suspect the GPU to be the problem since I bought this used and got its PCB repaired not long ago, but I also looked at a different thread and some people told me it could also be PSU's fault. So can anyone tell me what component caused the issue? (cant really find a trusted shop to have my pc diagnosed so my resort is to just replace whatever started the problem)",

I look them up, but there's only so much you can gain from a search if you don't understand the fundamentals of how computer hardware actually works. It's a relatively budget build, around R10 000.00 ($579) more than my current PC (a laptop) cost me two years ago. Overall cost is about R24 100.00 ($1 395).\n\nAnyway, here's what I'm putting together, I went with quite a pricey motherboard so if I want to upgrade other parts in a few years I won't be limited as much by a less up-to-date motherboard. Also, maybe it's weird that I have a 1TB SSD and a 500GB HDD, but I have a lot of external hard drives connected to my home network, so I'm more concerned about having decent SSD space for games and programs than I am about having large storage space (500GB SSD + 2TB HDD cost me around R1 000.00 ($58) more than this configuration).\n\nPlease let me know if I have any 'bad' parts or glaring issues with the build:\n\nChassis: Montech X5 RGB Tempered Glass White ATX Mid Tower Desktop Chassis\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 8400F 4.7GHz 6-Core Zen 4 Socket AM5 Desktop CPU\n\nCPU Cooling: ID-Cooling FROZN A620 PRO SE BLACK 120mm Dual-Tower Black PWM CPU Cooler\n\nMotherboard: MSI X670E Gaming Plus WIFI 6E AMD X670E Ryzen Socket AM5 ATX Desktop Motherboard\n\nRAM: TeamGroup Expert 32GB(2x16GB) DDR5-7200MHz CL34 1.4V Black Desktop Memory \n\nGPU: MAXSUN Arc B580 Milestone 12G B580-MILESTONE-12G 12GB GDDR6 192-bit PCIe 4.0 Desktop Graphics Card\n\nPSU: Super Flower SF-850Z12DB ZILLION DB 850W 80 Plus Bronze Non-Modular Black ATX 3.1 Desktop Power Supply\n\nPrimary drive: Western Digital WD Blue SN5000 1TB M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe Solid State Drive\n\nSecondary drive: Western Digital WD Blue 500GB 5400 RPM SATA 6Gb/s 128MB Cache 2.5 Inch Hard Drive\n\nCase fans: ARCTIC P12 PWM PST 120mm Black Case Fan - 5 Pack\n\n  \nEdit: Somehow forgot the GPU",

    "selftext": "Hi all! My niece has this horrendous old mini ITX PC built into a tiny metal case. She said it was shutting off randomly and asked her cool aunt for help figuring out what's wrong. The cool aunt is suffering.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/DnvsTv5](https://imgur.com/a/DnvsTv5)\n\nPics and some details in the album!\n\nBut to summarize:\n\n\\- I don't know the full history of the PC\n\n\\- The black screening wasn't happening consistently (wondered if it was when the GPU was under load but no, it would just happen seemingly at random when the computer was on for anywhere from 5-15 minutes)\n\n\\- It was black screening with the fans still moving and was overheating badly (CPU fan was literally too caked with gunk to move, so that makes sense lol)\n\n\\- Clean Windows install went well but didn't change the behavior at all.\n\n\\- I cleaned it aggressively, fans all move now. Figured they baked the CPU to death so replaced it with the exact same model. Swapped the RAM just in case as well.\n\n\\- Now it only posts like 1/4 times I reset it and when it does, it black screens with the fans still going while trying to load into Windows. I can see the Windows logo and the little loading circle but then nothing.\n\nParts seem to be a Zotac 2070, Ryzen 5 3600, an m.2 SSD (unsure of brand), and a 500 W 80+Gold PSU (unsure of brand)\n\nI tried checking that everything was seated firmly and it all seems to be. What next?\n\nUPDATE: It took about 4 tries to get it to post at all again but I was able to get into the bios. Will add the pics to my album, and hopefully if something stands out as wrong someone will let me know! When I tried to leave Bios and boot into Windows it went black again, fans still spinning.",

During intense fights in Breakthrough with lots of explosions and effects, it can dip to around 150-160 FPS.\n\nOn operation firestorm I play around 175-210 fps in the middle of the map in Conquest. With action at the sectors this can fall down to 160-170. If there is a lot of actions down to like 150-155. But in average in this map it‚Äôs around 185-190 fps.\n\nOn more urban maps like the two New York maps, I usually get around 170‚Äì190 FPS in quieter areas, and around 150-160 FPS in heavy action. In rare moments of complete chaos (tanks, helis, explosions everywhere), it can briefly dip to 140 FPS, but only for a few seconds.\n\nAgain ‚Äî I know these are really great numbers.

I was hoping that someone in here would know what to do. \nI've bought a WD blue, 1tb ssd to replace the old drive in my laptop, and am trying to do a fresh install of windows 10. \nWhenever I try, it says x80300024 we couldn't install windows on this location. \n\nAny help is much appreciated. I know this isn't \"build\" related, I'm just frustrated. I'm pretty tech savvy, but not that tech savvy and I don't understand why windows won't just install onto the drive. ",

POWER ZONE 2 750W PSU. I decided to do a test boot and that went great, decided to do another boot inside of my Thermaltake View 170 with a few screws missing, that also went great.\n\nHere‚Äôs where I did something incredibly dumb.  With the way I routed my 24 pin connector, it was very sketchy. With all the tension with the screws it was practically crushing the PSU cables. Still, I decided to try booting it anyways and my CPU cooler turned on for just a moment and it was all dead.\n\nI tried reseating my power connectors, ensuring that they‚Äôre plugged in all the way and still no life. \n\nI would‚Äôve tried routing it through the top cut out that‚Äôs used in the advertising material for the case but the cable just wasn‚Äôt long enough and I was too impatient to want to wait for a cable extension. I now terribly regret that decision.\n\nAll I really want to know is what failed and what I should do to go forward. Apologies for my foolishness.  ",

I was just wondering if it's just me or some improvements could be done to fully utilize my pc to it's max potential.\n\nLately I recently bought a new monitor, the 27\" LG OLED QHD 480Hz and I am using my 27\" Samsung G3 Odyssey 144Hz monitor for a secondary. \n\nMy specs are as follows.\n\nROG Strix X870-F Gaming Wifi Motherboard\n\nRyzen 7 7800X3D 4.2GHz \n\nGigabyte NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 12G GDDR6X\n\n64 (4x16)GB DDR5 6000MHz C63 Corsair RAM\n\n990 PRO 2TB Samsung \n\n970 Evo Plus 1TB\n\n8TB HDD Barracuda \n\nWIndows 11 Pro\n\nEthernet connected\n\nI did eneble DOCP so I could utilize my RAM speeds to it's max.\n\nMy concern is that before I switched my monitor, (Samsung is the one I was using previously.) I could see it was pretty smooth when it came to performance. I could Alt+Tab with little to no lag or delays. Discord ran smooth. Opening Task manager I saw that my CPU usage percent averaged about 32%-55%. As for the memory it averaged about 40%. I aquired Battlefield 6 and adjusted the settings for performance so maybe I'm being nit-picky? Since it may be a high demanding game maybe thats why I feel sluggish when I Alt+Tab to see a video on Youtube or change something on Discord. Lastly, when I'm watching videos that have a lot of movement, I notice that my LG monitor doesnt look smooth and slightly laggy or \"choppy\", when it came to fast movement in a video. Any tips you all could throw my way would be greatly appreciated. Is it me or am I just being picky? Thanks!\n\n",

I'm unsure if I need 9070xt. I feel like I should change GPU for more stable FPS, better visuals but dont wanna spend 300$ more if I dont need to (but would gladly if the difference is okay/worth it). I got 32RAM, MOBO with pcle 4.0 if that matters. I even feel good with 3060 rn but I havent really played on any high-tier GPUS (if 9070xt belongs to that category) so really unsure of all the differences, and want to play some AAA titles and future proof it for couple of years I guess. Want to know what yall think its best.   \n(RN playing GTA V, CS2, RDR2, Last of us 2)  \nAlso im not fixed on 9060/70xt's, any other recommendations?   \n\n\nThanks to everyone in advance for taking their time.",

While i'd appreciate help with the components, the real problem i'm facing is finding a proper case.\n\nThese are the Components:\n\n- AMD Ryzen 5 7600 Processor (Integrated Radeon Graphics Card, 6 Cores/12 Threads)\n\n- MSI PRO B650M-P Motherboard, Micro ATX, Supports AMD Ryzen 7000, AM5 - DDR5 Memory Boost 6000+MHz/OC, 1 PCIe 4.0 x16, 2 M.2 Gen4, 2.5G LAN\n\n- Samsung 990 PRO NVMe M.2 SSD, 1TB, PCIe 4.0, 7450MB/s read, 6900MB/s write, internal SSD for gaming and video editing, Black, MZ-V9P1T0BW\n\n- Thermaltake Toughpowee GT 850W | ATX 3.1 | 80+ GOLD | Modular\n\n- CORSAIR VENGEANCE RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz CL32 Intel XMP Compatible iCUE Computer Memory\n\n- ASUS ROG Strix RTX 3090 OC Limited White Edition\n\nThe PC is for Training AI Locally and dealing with huge Datasets, under 2.000 euros (i would be willing to spend up to 2.2-2.3k if truly worth it). \n\nThe case i had planned to buy was the ATX Mars Gaming MC3TCORELCDMW White but i've been told it wouldn't be a good idea because even though the components fit the issue is that the 3090 runs very hot and the case has relatively poor airflow, apparently? \n\nSo please help me find a Case with great Airflow for the 3090 which is big enough to fit the PSU as well (many cases i liked were too small for the PSU). I'd be fine spending up to 200 if it looks good since Aesthetic is kind of important too. Put it simply, i want one of those cool PCs with lights in it, even though it sounds childish put this way hahaha. Thank you in advance, and if there's problems with my build please tell me.",

    "selftext": "Reliability is extremely important to me because I'm neither in the US nor in a country where Amazon ships. I'd have to ship the computer to a freight forwarder, who would then ship it to me. I'm not sure if returns are possible, but at best it would be quite a hassle.\n\nI want to find a mini PC model that meets my needs and is generally trusted for reliability. I want a mini PC because my Dell XPS 15 (7th Gen i5-7300HQ, 8GB RAM) can't run Windows 11, and I want a super clean desk (I'll mount it on a VESA mount under my desk). That said, my laptop performs exceptionally well: boots quickly, apps open fast, and Chrome runs smoothly even with heavy tabs. Even though my laptop is older, I've seen it outperform newer machines significantly. I want a mini PC that's at least as powerful as this one and runs Windows 11.\n\nI'll use the computer for work. My job mainly involves using SaaS tools in Chrome (primarily Coda.io, Monday.com, and Google Workspace), MS Teams, video calls, Excel, and some light programming. I occasionally play games, mostly older titles (like Civilization V) or indie games. I occasionally open Photoshop. I don't edit video or render graphics, but I occasionally edit audio. I don't plan to train AI models or purchase an external GPU. Aesthetics matter to me. I dislike cheap plastic boxes, but since it will sit under my desk, I might overlook this.\n\nI need at least 16GB of RAM or a 512GB SSD (with one empty slot). My budget is capped at around $300. My current top choice is the ACEMAGIC V1. Does it meet my requirements? I'd appreciate feedback from those who've done extensive research on reviews and such.",

But once it moves past the BIOS screen to boot into Windows, my display goes completely black.\n\nThe only way I can get a picture back is by unplugging my DisplayPort cable and plugging it into another DisplayPort slot on my GPU. After that, Windows loads normally and everything works fine (no performance or stability issues once I‚Äôm in).\n\nI‚Äôm running an **RTX 5080** on the latest drivers and firmware, with a **DisplayPort 1.4 cable** and a 4K monitor. I‚Äôve already tried:\n\n* Updating BIOS and GPU drivers\n* Swapping DisplayPort cables\n* Changing which DisplayPort on the GPU I use\n* Re-seating the GPU and checking connections\n\nSame issue every time. BIOS shows fine, but Windows startup = black screen until I switch DisplayPort ports.\n\nHas anyone run into something similar or found a fix? Is this an issue with early 5080 firmware, DisplayPort handshake, or something else?\n\nThanks in advance for any ideas\n\n",

I'm a fan of future proofing my builds so I don't have to worry about upgrading for a few years. If we can keep anything from the current lineup without bottle-necking that'd be convenient.

I bought a 3080 FTW Ultra I still have unopened because I lucked out on a 3060 before it arrived and then never felt the upgrade was worth it with my cpu being a bottleneck but intent to use it when I did upgrade. Im a developer with no crazy workloads, and did lighter gaming/was fine with lower settings, but now I have a G9 Ultrawide that‚Äôs basically two 4k monitors side by side, got more into pc gaming with interest in some that push the 3060, and recently got a meta quest I‚Äôd love to play PC VR games on. \n\nSince I have the card and a lot of other components are older on my current rig, I was going to build a new one around the 3080, but now I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs worth it, or if I should just put it in my current rig to squeeze some more life out of it, or sell it for what little it‚Äôs worth and put it all towards a new rig.\n\nI was planning to spend a little over 1000 for other parts for the new pc, but Im not in a rush and could piece it together slowly and do about 2000, maybe a bit more. \n\nWhat would you do? Keep the old one as long as possible? Frankenstein your old rig? Build a new one that is too powerful for the 3080 for a few years to squeeze it for a little value until better cards come down in price and replace just the card? Or just chalk it up as a loss and go for broke on all new parts over like a year? ",

    "selftext": "Hello, gentlemen!\n\n  \nI am eager to upgrade my rig which I built on 2020. Its current specs are:\n\n* ASUS ROG STRIX X570-E GAMING (AM4)\n* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER (MSI)\n* AMD Ryzen 9 3900X\n* KINGSTON HYPERX 16,0GB Dual-Channel DDR4 @ 1197MHz\n* Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 1TB\n* ASUS TUF Gaming VG249 (1920x1080@144Hz)\n* PSU Corsair TX750M, 750W, 80 Plus¬Æ Gold, Semi-Modular\n\nI have already bought such RAM sticks a while ago: \n\n* Kingston Fury Beast RGB, 64 GB Dual-Channel DDR4 @ 3600 MHz. \n\nIn my cart, I currently have these items: \n\n* MSI GeForce RTX 5080 16GB GAMING TRIO OC WHITE  \n* Corsair | Fully Modular Ultra-Low Noise Platinum ATX 1000 Watt PC Power Supply (EU) | HX1000i | 1000 W  \n* SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 2TB NVMe\n\nI did a bit of \"literature review\" and what I understood from it, pairing RTX 5080 with my current CPU (AMD Ryzen 9 3900X) is not the best idea, in terms of performance, of course. On the other threads with a similar situation as mine, people were actively suggesting to get AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D or 5800X3D, which should provide a rather well-performing \"cover\" even up until motherboards with AM6 socket show up. Well, I would love to do so also, but since both of these CPU models were discontinued and I cannot find where to buy them from reliable vendors anymore, it seems that I am a little too late to catch this train (all we had to do was follow the damn train, CJ.....).\n\nThe thing is that out of all my current PC components, I was not planning to replace the motherboard anytime soon at all. And I would love to keep it in this way, for now. But it seems that staying on AM4 socket without any significant CPU upgrade from the 3900X is not the most rational decision either. What do you reckon, guys? With those X3D CPUs now being out of question, is there anything else decent on the market for AM4 socket to pair with RTX 5080? Or am I doomed to scavenge for the shiny coins in my wallet even deeper?\n\nBy the way, I am strongly considering switching from 1080p to 4K resolution monitor. That is another reason which kinda whispers to me that I could last for a good while with my current motherboard. What do you, folks, think about this? On the same note, could you suggest any well-rounded (price-performance-quality) 4K res monitor for such a purpose (competitive (amateur level) online FPS gaming included)? ",

    "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nlast time I was active on here was when I was prepping to build my PC back in 2018. Now I am thinking of finally pulling the trigger on upgrading it, after a few years of wanting to do it.\n\nI am \"only\" upgrading my Intel 8700k CPU, since my 3080 GPU is doing fine, but I know that after doing a CPU upgrade after so many years AND choosing to switch to AMD, I have to replace the Mobo, the cooler and even RAM too, because mine is DDR4 and I think only DDR5 is supported now (?)....oh and probably PSU too if my current 750W one wont hold with the new things...\n\nAfter a bit of research after so many years of not following what is up, I ended up on picking AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, since it seems to cover what I need and I dont mind the price, but other AMD suggestions are welcomed.\n\nMy questions now are:\n\n\\- how can I find easily the different motherboards for this CPU? Do I just look for any AMD AM5 Socket?\n\n\\- same question as above but about finding coolers for it\n\n\\- from what I read, I might have picked the worst time to have to upgrade RAM, since it apparently just skyrocketed thanks to AI datacenters. Is this true?\n\nBut most of all:\n\nI noticed some rumors about AM6 socket coming out next year and DDR6 soon too? If so, now I am doubting if I should invest in a new CPU, Motherboard, cooler and RAM (and PSU), if a whole new platform will come out next year and then I will have to buy all of that again if/when I decide to do the next upgrade. So now I am wondering if I should just wait 1 more year before the upgrade. Any thoughts?\n\nEDIT: oh and, would the new(er) AMD socket support older CPU from the old one? My vague memory has it that it was so (for some gens) back in 2018?",

    "title": "North + 5090 + 9800X3D + Noctua",
    "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nIt has been about 5 years since I last upgraded my machine and instead of using the same case I had previously for 12 years (fractal define R4). I decided it's time for a ground up build.\n\nI like Racing and FPS and hope to have some racing simulator parts next year after bonus time. I did a lot of research on the parts of this build determining where the best price for performance was while still striving for the best. Say what you will about Nvidia the 5090 is the best card right now and I wanted 4K gaming for the next several years. I also work with LLMs and run things locally although my old PC will likely become the server where I run those workloads. Researching the AMD processors there were some really good youtube videos outlining the performance difference for 9950x3d vs. 9800 x3d and because they were within a few frames of each other I deciding to go with the 9800X3D. I don't do a ton of multithreaded work like content or code compilation. The rest of my choices stem from the fact the I love ASUS motherboards and the TUF style hardware and design. Obviously I am a big Noctua fan (haha) as well s the black and brown theme of the build was good to embrace their colors.\n\nI had seen the Fractal North years ago before it was available in the US and loved it but I was actually going to get the Antec Flux mid tower case before it went out of stock. I picked up all these parts in person at microcenter an hour away from me (except the Noctua fans, they didn't have the G2 LS models). So I defaulted back to the North case and couldn't be happier, although I have to return some of the extra fans.\n\nThis build is absolutely silent and the temps are 45 C for the CPU and 45 C for the GPU at idle. Build Pics and parts list are below. I gave you a gander at my full desk where I have my work standing desk. Still a lot of cable cleanup to do here but it is functional and I like that. I have been in this place for less than a year so still need to paint and add some art. Cheers to you and your builds.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/9g4md31](https://imgur.com/a/9g4md31)\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/b/q4gbt6](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/q4gbt6)\n\nEDIT: Modified the idle temperature after flipping the front fan to intake. \n\nThe PSU is in hybrid mode (review the instruction booklet from Seasonic in the video I linked for you below). I have tried the PSU with the fan facing up in hybrid mode and the fan down in normal mode and categorically there is no difference in temps at idle or under load. The mid tower is a small and tight case these are still massive components. I saw more of a drop in temps when my A/C was on then any other factor.\n\n[https://youtu.be/Y0deAEf\\_0cc?t=170](https://youtu.be/Y0deAEf_0cc?t=170)\n\nI've stress tested this machine and under load how well it cools in response. When under load during a stress test with 3d mark or gaming with battlefield for a couple hours the GPU never goes above 61-64 C and the CPU is 53-55 Steady. As soon as I am done gaming within a minute or two the system cools to idle temp 43 and 45 C respectively. This seems to be operating pretty efficiently for the hardware that it is in my experience and testing. But always open to more feedback. Long live air cooling!",

During intense fights in Breakthrough with lots of explosions and effects, it can dip to around 150-160 FPS.\n\nOn operation firestorm I play around 175-210 fps in the middle of the map in Conquest. With action at the sectors this can fall down to 160-170. If there is a lot of actions down to like 150-155. But in average in this map it‚Äôs around 185-190 fps.\n\nOn more urban maps like the two New York maps, I usually get around 170‚Äì190 FPS in quieter areas, and around 150-160 FPS in heavy action. In rare moments of complete chaos (tanks, helis, explosions everywhere), it can briefly dip to 140 FPS, but only for a few seconds.\n\nAgain ‚Äî I know these are really great numbers.

Im a developer with no crazy workloads, and did lighter gaming/was fine with lower settings, but now I have a G9 Ultrawide that‚Äôs basically two 4k monitors side by side, got more into pc gaming with interest in some that push the 3060, and recently got a meta quest I‚Äôd love to play PC VR games on. \n\nSince I have the card and a lot of other components are older on my current rig, I was going to build a new one around the 3080, but now I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs worth it, or if I should just put it in my current rig to squeeze some more life out of it, or sell it for what little it‚Äôs worth and put it all towards a new rig.\n\nI was planning to spend a little over 1000 for other parts for the new pc, but Im not in a rush and could piece it together slowly and do about 2000, maybe a bit more. \n\nWhat would you do? Keep the old one as long as possible? Frankenstein your old rig? Build a new one that is too powerful for the 3080 for a few years to squeeze it for a little value until better cards come down in price and replace just the card? Or just chalk it up as a loss and go for broke on all new parts over like a year? ",

Some other specs on my computer are the MS-Challenger a520m-k motherboard and a 550W PSU. I know my PC is on lower end for hardware and am better off just upgrading the whole thing but for the time being I‚Äôd just like a new a cpu. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. ",

Marvel rivals buffers like crazy, cyberpunk buffers on rare occasion, that kind of thing. I actually just got accepted to the marathon playtest, which is pretty awsome, but my pc is struggling at times when a lot is happening and buffers there too. So, basically, what is a good amount of specs to have without breaking the bank? I really don't know much of anything about computers beyond the very very basics. With my limited knowledge, i think I likely need a new graphics card and a ssd. What kind should I get? Or do you think my issue comes from elsewhere?",

I suspect the GPU to be the problem since I bought this used and got its PCB repaired not long ago, but I also looked at a different thread and some people told me it could also be PSU's fault. So can anyone tell me what component caused the issue? (cant really find a trusted shop to have my pc diagnosed so my resort is to just replace whatever started the problem)",

I look them up, but there's only so much you can gain from a search if you don't understand the fundamentals of how computer hardware actually works. It's a relatively budget build, around R10 000.00 ($579) more than my current PC (a laptop) cost me two years ago. Overall cost is about R24 100.00 ($1 395).\n\nAnyway, here's what I'm putting together, I went with quite a pricey motherboard so if I want to upgrade other parts in a few years I won't be limited as much by a less up-to-date motherboard. Also, maybe it's weird that I have a 1TB SSD and a 500GB HDD, but I have a lot of external hard drives connected to my home network, so I'm more concerned about having decent SSD space for games and programs than I am about having large storage space (500GB SSD + 2TB HDD cost me around R1 000.00 ($58) more than this configuration).\n\nPlease let me know if I have any 'bad' parts or glaring issues with the build:\n\nChassis: Montech X5 RGB Tempered Glass White ATX Mid Tower Desktop Chassis\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 8400F 4.7GHz 6-Core Zen 4 Socket AM5 Desktop CPU\n\nCPU Cooling: ID-Cooling FROZN A620 PRO SE BLACK 120mm Dual-Tower Black PWM CPU Cooler\n\nMotherboard: MSI X670E Gaming Plus WIFI 6E AMD X670E Ryzen Socket AM5 ATX Desktop Motherboard\n\nRAM: TeamGroup Expert 32GB(2x16GB) DDR5-7200MHz CL34 1.4V Black Desktop Memory \n\nGPU: MAXSUN Arc B580 Milestone 12G B580-MILESTONE-12G 12GB GDDR6 192-bit PCIe 4.0 Desktop Graphics Card\n\nPSU: Super Flower SF-850Z12DB ZILLION DB 850W 80 Plus Bronze Non-Modular Black ATX 3.1 Desktop Power Supply\n\nPrimary drive: Western Digital WD Blue SN5000 1TB M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe Solid State Drive\n\nSecondary drive: Western Digital WD Blue 500GB 5400 RPM SATA 6Gb/s 128MB Cache 2.5 Inch Hard Drive\n\nCase fans: ARCTIC P12 PWM PST 120mm Black Case Fan - 5 Pack\n\n  \nEdit: Somehow forgot the GPU",

The cool aunt is suffering.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/DnvsTv5](https://imgur.com/a/DnvsTv5)\n\nPics and some details in the album!\n\nBut to summarize:\n\n\\- I don't know the full history of the PC\n\n\\- The black screening wasn't happening consistently (wondered if it was when the GPU was under load but no, it would just happen seemingly at random when the computer was on for anywhere from 5-15 minutes)\n\n\\- It was black screening with the fans still moving and was overheating badly (CPU fan was literally too caked with gunk to move, so that makes sense lol)\n\n\\- Clean Windows install went well but didn't change the behavior at all.\n\n\\- I cleaned it aggressively, fans all move now. Figured they baked the CPU to death so replaced it with the exact same model. Swapped the RAM just in case as well.\n\n\\- Now it only posts like 1/4 times I reset it and when it does, it black screens with the fans still going while trying to load into Windows. I can see the Windows logo and the little loading circle but then nothing.\n\nParts seem to be a Zotac 2070, Ryzen 5 3600, an m.2 SSD (unsure of brand), and a 500 W 80+Gold PSU (unsure of brand)\n\nI tried checking that everything was seated firmly and it all seems to be. What next?\n\nUPDATE: It took about 4 tries to get it to post at all again but I was able to get into the bios. Will add the pics to my album, and hopefully if something stands out as wrong someone will let me know! When I tried to leave Bios and boot into Windows it went black again, fans still spinning.",

    "title": "North + 5090 + 9800X3D + Noctua",
    "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nIt has been about 5 years since I last upgraded my machine and instead of using the same case I had previously for 12 years (fractal define R4). I decided it's time for a ground up build.\n\nI like Racing and FPS and hope to have some racing simulator parts next year after bonus time. I did a lot of research on the parts of this build determining where the best price for performance was while still striving for the best. Say what you will about Nvidia the 5090 is the best card right now and I wanted 4K gaming for the next several years. I also work with LLMs and run things locally although my old PC will likely become the server where I run those workloads. Researching the AMD processors there were some really good youtube videos outlining the performance difference for 9950x3d vs. 9800 x3d and because they were within a few frames of each other I deciding to go with the 9800X3D. I don't do a ton of multithreaded work like content or code compilation. The rest of my choices stem from the fact the I love ASUS motherboards and the TUF style hardware and design. Obviously I am a big Noctua fan (haha) as well s the black and brown theme of the build was good to embrace their colors.\n\nI had seen the Fractal North years ago before it was available in the US and loved it but I was actually going to get the Antec Flux mid tower case before it went out of stock. I picked up all these parts in person at microcenter an hour away from me (except the Noctua fans, they didn't have the G2 LS models). So I defaulted back to the North case and couldn't be happier, although I have to return some of the extra fans.\n\nThis build is absolutely silent and the temps are 45 C for the CPU and 45 C for the GPU at idle. Build Pics and parts list are below. I gave you a gander at my full desk where I have my work standing desk. Still a lot of cable cleanup to do here but it is functional and I like that. I have been in this place for less than a year so still need to paint and add some art. Cheers to you and your builds.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/9g4md31](https://imgur.com/a/9g4md31)\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/b/q4gbt6](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/q4gbt6)\n\nEDIT: Modified the idle temperature after flipping the front fan to intake. \n\nThe PSU is in hybrid mode (review the instruction booklet from Seasonic in the video I linked for you below). I have tried the PSU with the fan facing up in hybrid mode and the fan down in normal mode and categorically there is no difference in temps at idle or under load. The mid tower is a small and tight case these are still massive components. I saw more of a drop in temps when my A/C was on then any other factor.\n\n[https://youtu.be/Y0deAEf\\_0cc?t=170](https://youtu.be/Y0deAEf_0cc?t=170)\n\nI've stress tested this machine and under load how well it cools in response. When under load during a stress test with 3d mark or gaming with battlefield for a couple hours the GPU never goes above 61-64 C and the CPU is 53-55 Steady. As soon as I am done gaming within a minute or two the system cools to idle temp 43 and 45 C respectively. This seems to be operating pretty efficiently for the hardware that it is in my experience and testing. But always open to more feedback. Long live air cooling!",

During intense fights in Breakthrough with lots of explosions and effects, it can dip to around 150-160 FPS.\n\nOn operation firestorm I play around 175-210 fps in the middle of the map in Conquest. With action at the sectors this can fall down to 160-170. If there is a lot of actions down to like 150-155. But in average in this map it‚Äôs around 185-190 fps.\n\nOn more urban maps like the two New York maps, I usually get around 170‚Äì190 FPS in quieter areas, and around 150-160 FPS in heavy action. In rare moments of complete chaos (tanks, helis, explosions everywhere), it can briefly dip to 140 FPS, but only for a few seconds.\n\nAgain ‚Äî I know these are really great numbers. I‚Äôm just curious how this compares to what others are getting with a similar setup.\n",

I assume its because of CPU - it sits at 100% when stream is turned on.\n\nBesides, i want to upgrade anyway cause im a nerd when it comes to these things ü§ë\n\nHere is my current setup: MSI Radeon RX 6750XT Mech 2X 12GB DDR6 Ryzen 5 5600 Ram 4x 16GB CL16 3200MHz MSI B550-A PRO 2x lexar 1TB m.2 750w power supply\n\nI was thinking of a CPU upgrade, but i can‚Äôt decide which one. Budget id say 250-400$, depends if the jump in performance is huge.\n\nCan you give me any recommendations?",

    "selftext": "Hi guys I just wanted to share my experience! I've always been Intel for the longest and been chilling on my i9 9900k since maybe 2020/21 and it's performed great for me ever since. I've had it paired with a 3080 since and still now, and while it performed great, I thought it should be better. I've played all the biggest releases on it getting decent fps on a mix high/max settings as I preferred my games to look good on my 1440p 144h monitor especially in single player games than try to reach my refresh rate and I was satisfied with it because I thought that was my ceiling for me! But holy SHIT I never thought with this card I could run battlefield 6 at MAX settings, 1440p, stream it on discord, and hover 100+ fps all with my new 7800x3d!!! It was on sale for at a microcenter near me for $299 and thought wow I had to purchase this right away. I am so glad I did. My gaming and even just doing simple computer task has never been better. I feel like I can run any game with this duo and I'm just so happy. Maybe it's the upgrade to DDR5 ram as well but wow if you're thinking about upgrading to the 7800x3d right now it's so good!!!! Just wanted to share hehe thank you for reading",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe‚Äôve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It‚Äôs a fast, chaotic beat ‚Äôem up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who‚Äôs Mexican, and it‚Äôs directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt‚Äôs basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It‚Äôs been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo‚Äôs now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We‚Äôve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that‚Äôs part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I‚Äôll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pok√©mon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today¬†announced a new partnership¬†with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by¬†Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also¬†just broke¬†that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners‚Äîa group of investors‚Äîwould be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game‚Äôs many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroƒülu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2¬†is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If¬†The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the sameÔªø experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original‚Äôs formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player‚Äôs ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however‚Äîparticularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn‚Äôt a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste ‚Äì it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio‚Äôs vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I‚Äôll admit, there‚Äôs a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [S√∂nke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw ‚Äì it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine ‚Äî sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices ‚Äî all wrapped in Obsidian‚Äôs signature corporate satire. It‚Äôs funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it‚Äôs a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galv√£o](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved‚Äîbitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting‚Äîbut without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Micha≈Ç Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom‚Äîthough a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian‚Äôs brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland‚Äîalmost forgettable‚Äîcompanions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It‚Äôs a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn‚Äôt lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you‚Äôll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran ≈Ωalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

Too afraid to alienate players and make big swings like the setting deserves.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nexus Hub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus-hub)** - [Andrew Logue](https://opencritic.com/critic/3996/andrew-logue) - [8 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves if it ain‚Äôt broke, make it bigger and prettier - a solid sequel that expands upon the first game in meaningful ways, though some fans might experience a bit of d√©j√† vu.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Vincent Ternida](https://opencritic.com/critic/8412/vincent-ternida) - [8 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a title well worth exploring, offering accessible gameplay and thoughtful quality-of-life enhancements that cater to both newcomers and returning fans. While it doesn‚Äôt radically reinvent the formula, it delivers a satisfying action RPG experience that scratches the adventure itch and rewards players who engage with its missions in full.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PPE.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/642/ppe-pl)** - [Patryk Dziƒôglewicz](https://opencritic.com/critic/8235/patryk-dzi-glewicz) - *Polish* - [8 / 10](https://www.ppe.pl/recenzje/387599/the-outer-worlds-2-recenzja-gry-chciwosc-kontra-totalitaryzm.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 may not revolutionize what we saw in the first installment, but it significantly improves on familiar elements. If you're in the mood for a great space opera with a satirical twist and RPG elements, you should definitely give this shooter a try.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pizza Fria](https://opencritic.com/outlet/915/pizza-fria)** - [Leandro Felippe de Paiva¬†Gomes](https://opencritic.com/critic/10798/leandro-felippe-de-paiva-gomes) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://pizzafria.ig.com.br/analises/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 manages to captivate with its charismatic cast of characters, a world that truly rewards exploration, and a good variety of approaches and choices that generate real consequences in the player's journey.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Timothy Nunes](https://opencritic.com/critic/846/timothy-nunes) - [9 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-ps5/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 excels on almost all fronts, presenting you with an open RPG that lets you choose how you progress while still keeping you on a clear path. The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you‚Äôll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avil√©s](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it‚Äôs the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could‚Äôve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It‚Äôs packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that‚Äôll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie‚Äôs Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It‚Äôs pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn‚Äôt Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of¬†The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but¬†TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe‚Äôve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It‚Äôs a fast, chaotic beat ‚Äôem up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who‚Äôs Mexican, and it‚Äôs directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt‚Äôs basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It‚Äôs been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo‚Äôs now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We‚Äôve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that‚Äôs part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I‚Äôll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pok√©mon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe‚Äôve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It‚Äôs a fast, chaotic beat ‚Äôem up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who‚Äôs Mexican, and it‚Äôs directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt‚Äôs basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It‚Äôs been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo‚Äôs now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We‚Äôve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that‚Äôs part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I‚Äôll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pok√©mon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

    "selftext": "So recently, there was a meme post about people claiming there is no difference between 60 and 120 hz or something, only to realize their hz settings were still set to 60hz. Spiderman glasses meme. So When I got my 240 hz monitor way back, I had same issue, quickly figured it out, I was using resolution from this section that has 60hz max refresh rate limit for whatever reason. Unlike same resolution in PC section that will let you use your monitor's full potential. Later on I visited my cousin and he didn't understood why his 120hz monitor runs max in 60hz. Well I fixe that for ya, and went straight to PC section, for same res with fully unlocked hz. On top of that I often change resolution in that exact panel and constantly have to scroll through this useless (seamingly) section (using DSR 4k on my 1080p often). Which just pisses me off. There must be a ton of people who are locked to 60hz because they don't know any better, on their far more capable monitors untill they figure it out, and people who... never do and just say fuck it. WHY IS THIS SECTION THERE?!",

And buying a PS5 just to play BF6 is not an option either. \n\nSo my question is, is it possible for me to somehow test BF6 on my computer to see how it runs?",

    "selftext": "Don't buy AMD CPU . I'm a small computer shop owner here in Vietnam, been building and selling PCs for years. I've always pushed AMD CPUs to customers because of the hype around value and performance ‚Äì Ryzen is great on paper, right? But after dealing with their warranty process firsthand, I'm DONE. I'm venting here because this needs to be called out: AMD is straight-up dodging claims on faulty products, and it's screwing over retailers and end-users like us.\n\nHere's what happened: We got a batch of AMD CPUs that were DOA or failing quickly. As a legit seller, I file a warranty claim right on their official site. What do I get? Endless runaround:\n\n* First, they tell me to contact Amazon for support. WTF? They don't know that Amazon only selling things\n* Then, they demand I test the CPUs on MULTIPLE different motherboards and send photos of every test. I'm a busy shop, not a lab ‚Äì this is ridiculous and time-wasting.\n* I do it anyway, send everything. Next: \"Send your invoice.\" Done.\n* Boom, rejection: \"Images and invoice invalid.\" No specifics, no fixes. Just invalid. When I push back and say \"If it's invalid, just use the manufacturing date like Intel does for warranty calc,\" they ghost or ignore it. Feels like they're intentionally refusing to honor warranties on their junk batches to save money.\n\nThis isn't isolated ‚Äì I've heard similar stories from other sellers. AMD's quality control seems hit-or-miss, and their support is non-existent for international folks. Meanwhile, Intel? Smooth sailing every time. Submit claim, they verify via date code if needed, RMA approved, done. No BS tests or excuses.\n\nBottom line: Don't buy AMD anymore. Their CPUs might be cheap, but the headaches aren't worth it. We're switching our shop fully to Intel stock ‚Äì reliable, better support, and you won't get burned. If you're building or upgrading, go Intel. Save yourself the frustration.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with AMD warranty hell? Share your stories below. Upvote if this resonates ‚Äì maybe it'll pressure them to fix their crap.\n\nAMD warranty = evasion tactics and invalid excuses. Intel treats you right. Avoid AMD.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9buuoyfysxf1.png?width=2077&format=png&auto=webp&s=67170290f34d292ad5ee7d9db44044df8a2b3965\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/noo2gpyfysxf1.png?width=2115&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7e248239cf71f77bc17938a616d6c9ade9b3475\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/trd86pyfysxf1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=3179974dfe1851685e5a186a227869b599b96923\n\n  \n",

Temps look fine according to Hardware Monitor, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs overheating.\n\nMy motherboard is a bit old, so I‚Äôm wondering if it might not be fully compatible with the 5070 Ti. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs a prebuilt system, so I can‚Äôt update the BIOS because the model of motherboard is manufacture specific. Any ideas or advice would be super appreciated!\n\nGigabyte Technology Co., Ltd. B560 DS3H AC-Y1 Motherboard - 11th gen intel core i7-11700f 2.50ghz CPU - Nvidia 5070ti - 16gb of ram.",

Makes no sense to me, sure they had a few hiccups with the 13th and 14th gen with overheating but Core Ultra is just a really unappealing naming scheme to me. Maybe it would have been a better transition if they didn't confusingly release the first desktop processors on the second generation, and also have a completely different line of processors simply called \"Intel Core\" on the side? Really makes me want to go with AMD for my next processor because of their good reputation and a naming scheme that makes sense.",

I went to a local shop and checked some models but the owner of the shop warned me that some B850 models (specially micro-ATX ones) from ASUS might stop receiving bios updates sooner than some other models.\n\nThis was the first time I hear something like that but he also named two models and it seems that he is right. So here is the example he gave me :\n\n1. Asus Prime B450M-A, stuck on AGESA 1.2.0Cc from 2024, board released on July 2018 :\n\n[https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-b450m-a/helpdesk\\_bios?model2Name=PRIME-B450M-A](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-b450m-a/helpdesk_bios?model2Name=PRIME-B450M-A)\n\n2. Asus Prime B450-PLUS, receiving regular updates till now, board released on September 2018 :\n\n[https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-b450-plus/helpdesk\\_bios?model2Name=PRIME-B450-PLUS](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-b450-plus/helpdesk_bios?model2Name=PRIME-B450-PLUS)\n\nI wasn't able to find any article or video talking about such thing so anyone has any idea how this policy works ? Both models that he mentioned are not from TUF or ROG series and belong to Prime series. \n\nDo other brands do this too ? So that motherboards with same chipset and same series have different update policy and one stops receiving updates years before another.",

Usually I have been able to clean them off easily with some water and a micro fiber cloth. Unfortunately i left some stains alone for a few weeks and they've become very difficult to remove. I've tried a solution of water + vinegar (artificial) as well as a non ammonia + non alcohol screen cleaner but they have not worked. \n\nAre there any strong screen cleaning options that might clear them off? My worry is that the water from the air conditioner is mixed with chemicals and have stained my monitor permanently. Here is a close up of one batch of stains, there are 3-4 batches like these all over my screen. In case it matters i have a VA panel monitor. Ignore the dots thats just dust, the issue is the streaks in the middle of the picture. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g74uq2eyfsxf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b11068f4e9a2d1bcb70dc71b60834a23944babdd\n\n ",

But once it moves past the BIOS screen to boot into Windows, my display goes completely black.\n\nThe only way I can get a picture back is by unplugging my DisplayPort cable and plugging it into another DisplayPort slot on my GPU. After that, Windows loads normally and everything works fine (no performance or stability issues once I‚Äôm in).\n\nI‚Äôm running an **RTX 5080** on the latest drivers and firmware, with a **DisplayPort 1.4 cable** and a 4K monitor. I‚Äôve already tried:\n\n* Updating BIOS and GPU drivers\n* Swapping DisplayPort cables\n* Changing which DisplayPort on the GPU I use\n* Re-seating the GPU and checking connections\n\nSame issue every time. BIOS shows fine, but Windows startup = black screen until I switch DisplayPort ports.\n\nHas anyone run into something similar or found a fix? Is this an issue with early 5080 firmware, DisplayPort handshake, or something else?\n\nThanks in advance for any ideas",

I spent a day overclocking/undervolting my GPU, was 100% stable no crashes, turned my PC off for the night, got back on the next day only to realize my GPU fans weren't spinning, and sure enough AMD turned off the custom settings and everything was default. figured okay maybe overclocks werent actually stable (even though i tested every benchmark software and ran occt stress test 3 times). Just turned off zero rpm instead, thats the only setting i changed. Sure enough today, boom, reset it to default again.\n\nIf my PC goes to sleep its fine, settings will stay, but if i shut my PC down, it seems like it will always reset itself. Do I have to keep doing my overclock/fan curve every single time i start my PC back up?",

    "title": "Major F Up: Is the Power Supply Fried?",
    "selftext": "So, last month I built a new computer and decided that it would be a good idea to give my old computer to my brother. In the 5 years I‚Äôve had it, the computer ran with no problems the whole time, up until the very last week where it blue screened (I can count on less than one hand how many times this has happened to me in those five years). \n\nNow here‚Äôs the issue. I handed it off to my brother and for the first few weeks, it was working great until the BSOD and the random crashing nation attacked. I should mention that only until recently (less than 2 weeks ago) was my brother using the computer heavily since he stated getting into cyberpunk. We thought it could‚Äôve been corrupted drivers, so he wiped all the drivers with DDU, then reinstalled them and after that proved to not work, we went as far as to factory reset the whole system (to also reinstall windows). It worked for around 2 days but then we ran into a whole new set of problems: the monitor was flashing and sometimes didn‚Äôt display anything on startup, the computer would just restart and not post at all after restarting, and the mouse rgb and light sensor would be faint if anything. From here we narrowed it down to be a PSU issue. \n\nNow for some context on how the PC was being powered: My brother‚Äôs desk is far from an outlet and is in a spot where it is impossible to get a direct connection to the wall. As any person would do in this situation we did the next best thing: plug it into a power strip that was connected to the wall. The power strip was the first of two and had a direct connection to the wall. This strip had the PC, an AC, and a Router plugged into it. From here, there was another power strip plugged into this one (in a daisy chain) that housed and powered the peripherals like desk speakers, the monitor ect. and his Xbox series X. Initially when I was setting it up for him I was worried that this would cause issues since I wasn‚Äôt sure how many the watts the power strip could supply, and how doing it this way could damage the power supply or at worse, brick it. After seeing the problems aforementioned, and looking at the connection, we consulted the greatest tech genius in the world: ChatGPT. From here we picked a new power strip that came in today which supplied up to 1800+ watts, connected the AC directly into the wall so it‚Äôs independent from the PC power system, and tested to see if the computer would turn on and run normally. Like any ole volkswagen project car, doing the obvious thing didn‚Äôt fix the problem, so I think it‚Äôs almost definitely a PSU issue. But I‚Äôm not 100% sure. \n\nSide note: Apparently my brother ran the computer and AC at the same time a few times before. So, ~3000 Watts (an upper estimate, was probably lower than this at around 2000-2500watts)  being called for at once from two power strips in a daisy chain‚Ä¶ Yikes. \n\nTL/DR: PC was running cyberpunk until it started dying. Tried a bunch of things like reinstalling windows through a factory reset and wiping and reinstalling graphics drivers with DDU. Worked but then started seeing issues like computer not posting on startup sometimes, mouse RGB flickering and mouse sensor not lighting. Decided it‚Äôs a PSU problem since it was a sketchy connection that had a daisy chain system of power-strips attempting to supply around 1150-3000watts of power at a single time. PSU and maybe other parts might be fried.\n\nQuestion: Is this a PSU issue, and it is bad enough to the point where it‚Äôs damaged and it needs to be replaced? Could this be an issue with the Motherboard, RAM, CPU, and/or GPU? The computer still lights up on startup, just no post and weak to no power being supplied to the mouse. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm having a weird issue with my **Fifine AM8** USB microphone and I‚Äôm hoping someone might have some insight.\n\nI recorded a short video showing exactly what‚Äôs happening: [https://youtu.be/bRZSY0VQuqk](https://youtu.be/bRZSY0VQuqk)\n\n**Here‚Äôs the situation:**\n\n* According to the manual, if I hold the LED button for about 3 seconds, the RGB light should turn off completely. But instead, when I do that, the mic just starts **cycling through RGB colors** (like a sequence mode).\n* The **touch mute button** also stopped responding properly. It used to work fine ‚Äî I even used it earlier today in a meeting and it muted/unmuted normally ‚Äî but now it doesn‚Äôt do anything.\n* I tested the same mic on another computer, and there everything works perfectly ‚Äî LED control and mute button both function normally.\n* On my main PC, though, the issue persists no matter which port I use (I have two USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0).\n\n**What I‚Äôve already tested:**\n\n* Tried all USB ports on my computer (both 2.0 and 3.0).\n* Tested with a different cable ‚Äî same result.\n* Plugged into another computer ‚Äî worked perfectly.\n* Uninstalled and reinstalled the mic in Device Manager.\n* Checked Windows sound settings to make sure it‚Äôs recognized correctly.\n\n**My current thoughts:**\n\n* It doesn‚Äôt seem to be a hardware defect, since it works fine on another PC.\n* Could be a **USB 3.0 compatibility issue** or **power management setting** on my main system.\n* Maybe Windows or the USB controller isn‚Äôt handling the mic correctly (driver/firmware issue?).\n* Possibly interference or conflict with other USB peripherals.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Has anyone experienced something similar with the Fifine AM8 or other USB microphones ‚Äî where the **touch buttons stop working** or the **RGB light behaves oddly**?\n* Are there known issues with **USB 3.0 ports** or **selective suspend** affecting these mics?\n* Any tips on resetting or forcing a driver refresh that might fix this?\n\nAt this point, I‚Äôm trying to figure out whether it‚Äôs worth diving deeper into my USB configuration or if I should consider exchanging the mic. Any help or suggestions are appreciated!",

Maybe it would have been a better transition if they didn't confusingly release the first desktop processors on the second generation, and also have a completely different line of processors simply called \"Intel Core\" on the side? Really makes me want to go with AMD for my next processor because of their good reputation and a naming scheme that makes sense.",

Added riser under monitor\n2. Added keybo/mouse pad (my old one, ordered new one to test)\n3. Added a power shelf under the table on the right\n4. FIXED the monitor tilt, more cable management, tucked computer away behind bar\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\n1. Waiting on new shelf and plants.\n2. Ordered a pegboard as well for charging station\n3. New larger grey scale mouse pad\n4. Headphones modern stand coming in Monday\n\nThank you all for the recommendations and trolling :P was fun!  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Original Post  \nFinally got around revamping my work station.\n\n* Used the [74\" IKEA Kitchen KIRBY Walnut Veneer Table Top](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/karlby-countertop-for-kitchen-island-walnut-veneer-30297641/#content)\n* Got a welder to custom build legs for me\n* Bought square leg risers to add some height + have padding on the bottom of the feet.\n* Added LED lights from Temu\n* Cable management under the monitor area via Amazon\n* Monitor arm from Amazon as well\n* Yamaha HS7 Monitor + Amazon Stands (I wish the stands were shorter but the smaller ones couldn't handle the weight)\n\nMy computer is tucked in the back under, it doesnt stick out...just an early picture ( I built without lights for the first time thinking I wouldn't care lol, wish I got a sick case, but oh well)\n\nWaiting for blackfriday to get a new chair as the current one is too old.\n\nI wanted to add shelving so I bought one but not sure where to add it lol.

    "selftext": "Review time!\n\nModel: XVX MU68 FujiWave Theme Mechanical Keyboard | XVX/WORMIER\n\nPrice: $100 USD (20% discount for the week of Halloween)\n\nSize: 65%, 68 keys\n\nKeycaps: MOA profile, PBT\n\nHot Swappable?: Yes, switches are pre-lubed & linear I think\n\nGasket Mount: Yes, but there really isn't any flex?\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\n[https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard](https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: no, I didn't get this for free, but they did give me the 20% discount for Halloween after I purchased the keyboard because I was a couple days early for the discount and they said that a reddit review would be very helpful to them and I thought \"wow, that's a great idea. Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

I've paired the build with a purple and green Owlab Voice Mini, and MW Fright Night deskmat. \n\nThere's nothing better than combining multiple multiple purchases into one solid theme. Best of all both the board and macropad are wireless, which feels appropriate for a Halloween theme keeping everything untethered.\n\nThis is my 6th post that's part of #keebaweek.

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks ‚Äî band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast üôÇ.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me ‚Äî in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn‚Äôt make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they‚Äôll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly ‚Äî The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay‚Äôs voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away ‚Üí Roxette**  \nI‚Äôm still in love with Marie Fredriksson‚Äôs voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 ‚Üí Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele ‚Äî the man, the music, the attitude ‚Äî pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F ‚Üí Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The ‚Äú3‚Äù also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit ‚Äî Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 ‚Üí 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it‚Äôs probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive ‚Üí** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently‚Äôs Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt‚Äôs pure freedom, soul, happiness ‚Äî life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins‚Ä¶ and hopefully Bart‚Äôs story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy ‚Äî build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power ‚Üí N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote ‚Äútuurnn‚Äù next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in ‚Äî just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane ‚Üí** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane ‚Äî the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations ‚Üí** had to be here anyway, but this one‚Äôs a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song‚Äôs energy, Mark‚Äôs wild teenage years, his early work ‚Äî all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we‚Äôre at it‚Ä¶\n\n**P.I.J M.M ‚Üí Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite ‚Äî the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE ‚Üí Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come Through* would‚Äôve been too many ‚Äúdreams‚Äù ‚Äî and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire ‚Üí Scooter (HP Baxxter‚Äôs voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in P√©cs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously ‚Äî the best element!\n\n**Out of Space ‚Üí The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under ‚ÄúSpace‚Äù, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune‚Äôs ‚ÄúI was sent to outer space,‚Äù and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can‚Äôt Stop Raving* didn‚Äôt fit anymore üòÖ.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True ‚Üí** basically the slogan of the ‚Äô90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven‚Äôt outgrown it ‚Äî and honestly, ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù was never my strong suit üôÇ.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? ‚Üí** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I‚Äôve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here ‚Äî sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt need explaining, but I shouldn‚Äôt forget it either.\n* **NRG** ‚Äî same energy.\n* **Music** ‚Äî the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** ‚Äî clich√©, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** ‚Äî probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** ‚Äî took a while to find. Wanted something that says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fit in boxes,‚Äù kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** ‚Äî because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** ‚Äî as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** ‚Äî one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny ‚Äú-drive,‚Äù because if it‚Äôs worth doing, it‚Äôs worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn‚Äôt stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches‚Ä¶ the works.\n\nThat‚Äôs about all that fit ‚Äî for now.  \nI‚Äôve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer ‚Äî brush smears the paint, and I don‚Äôt want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the¬†***Logitech G915 TKL***¬†and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the¬†*G515*¬†with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the¬†***Keychron K1 Max***¬†with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using¬†[launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/)¬†but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use¬†[usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/wzb2GPh\n\nLeobog Hi75c Pro (stock except for keycaps and switches)  \nOsume Night Market keycaps  \nMMD Princess v4 linear switches (stock)  \n[Sound test but does NOT do it justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OokIrbbHVDw)\n\nI was out of the hobby for years until my friend told me about how much they loved their new Leobog Hi75. \nFirst off, I have to say the game has evolved in the past 5 years or so, offering many outstanding stock budget models you previously would have to spend hundreds to replicate. Big win for us all!\n\nI'm a big fan of marbley sounds and the Hi75 is the perfect model for this. Even stock, this thing sounded great.\nI tried HMX Canglan switches on this board, which sounded great but had a more muted and thocky sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the MMD Princesses which had a slightly higher-pitched sound, which I think really helps with the marbley sound as opposed to a more deep and flat sound. I was inspired by sound tests like [this one with MMD Princesses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2iPPrgfkIo) and [this one with Epomaker Jade Blossoms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9EoDIbE9OU) which sound basically perfect to me. The former is more like what my build sounds like IRL so I'm over the moon with the sound, but I still have Jade Blossoms on the way to see what they sound like as well.\n\nI'm also pleasantly surprised by these Osume keycaps. Not only do I like the non-standard legends and gradient colors from top to bottom, the packaging itself was very thoughtful (all rows separated in different trays, and individual places in the trays labeled, as opposed to all keycaps in one enormous tray with no labeling to help). And of course as a Taiwanese guy, I loved these novelties and had to spring for those as well. :)\n\nOverall this is the most perfect build I've ever made and I'm so happy with what the market looks like in 2025.",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Found bigger silicone bumpons that dont sink into deskpads completely, fixing ‚Äúthudding‚Äù. input parts number 107091 into [Here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/), order a reasonable amount and should deliver it to you for free\n\n\nNowadays I‚Äôve been noticing that some keyboards like the Frog Mini and some if the newer Neo boards having issues with how it sounds. This is mostly due to those keyboards having pretty short feet leading to the bottom of the keyboard to touch your deskpad as it compresses due to the weight of the keyboard which causes it to ‚Äúthud‚Äù. \n\nI‚Äôve had issues with this in the past since I use a XSoft mousepad from LethalGamingGear. When i put my keyboard on my mousepad it at first sounds fine, but as the keyboard starts to sink down due to its weight, i start to hear vibrations and ‚Äúthudding‚Äù from the desk.\n\nWhile building a drawer from ikea, i noticed that it came with some silicone bumpons to reduce the noise from the contact of the wood. And now compared to the normal hemisphere silicone bumpons that keyboards usually come with, these are a bit bigger. So I thought to try them on a keyboard that is thudding, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, tall enough so that the bottom does not touch my mousepad. I did some searching to see where i can find more of these and lo and behold, ikea actually gives them for free. Simply go to the [IKEA spare parts](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/) website and input part number 107091 and it should show up. Each one comes in a pack of 2 so as long as you order a reasonable amount, they should give them to you for free delivered straight to you.\n\nEDIT: Size for comparison. Smaller original feet are from a JJW Moment https://imgur.com/a/T48CUmH",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or ‚Äúmovement‚Äù, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom ‚Äúclacky‚Äù WS Flux HE switches as well as the ‚Äúdeep clacky‚Äù WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

All are connected to my PC at the same time (don‚Äôt ask) and I just grab one depending on what I‚Äôm doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn‚Äôt want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I‚Äôm done!! üòä\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "title": "I'm new to the mechanical keyboard world... But this one is so pretty! (Review)",
    "selftext": "Review time!\n\nModel: XVX MU68 FujiWave Theme Mechanical Keyboard | XVX/WORMIER\n\nPrice: $100 USD (20% discount for the week of Halloween)\n\nSize: 65%, 68 keys\n\nKeycaps: MOA profile, PBT\n\nHot Swappable?: Yes, switches are pre-lubed & linear I think\n\nGasket Mount: Yes, but there really isn't any flex?\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\n[https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard](https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: no, I didn't get this for free, but they did give me the 20% discount for Halloween after I purchased the keyboard because I was a couple days early for the discount and they said that a reddit review would be very helpful to them and I thought \"wow, that's a great idea. Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

    "selftext": "https://reddit.com/link/1ohqnll/video/3yg1upjhypxf1/player\n\nI made my first switch customization to my ZSA Moonlander Mark 1, and I love it. I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

    "selftext": "Review time!\n\nModel: XVX MU68 FujiWave Theme Mechanical Keyboard | XVX/WORMIER\n\nPrice: $100 USD (20% discount for the week of Halloween)\n\nSize: 65%, 68 keys\n\nKeycaps: MOA profile, PBT\n\nHot Swappable?: Yes, switches are pre-lubed & linear I think\n\nGasket Mount: Yes, but there really isn't any flex?\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\n[https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard](https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: no, I didn't get this for free, but they did give me the 20% discount for Halloween after I purchased the keyboard because I was a couple days early for the discount and they said that a reddit review would be very helpful to them and I thought \"wow, that's a great idea. Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

I'm currently on a 27inch 1440p Odyssey G5 G50D (IPS) and I've been thinking, maybe I should've gotten either of the 32 inch variants instead (VA/IPS)? It just feels like it'd be more immersive for gaming with an even bigger screen?\n\nDo you have any experience with this monitor specs combination? Is the PPI too low? Are there any *good* models with this rez/size setup, or are they all afterthoughts that nobody's buying?",

Size & Resolution: 27 inches and 1440p (2560x1440).\n3. Refresh Rate: Between 144 Hz and 180 Hz.\n4. Priority: Best possible image quality (color accuracy, contrast) and overall performance for gaming. I want a smooth, crisp image.\nMy Current Setup & Context:\n‚Ä¢ PC Specs: NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti 16GB and Intel i5-13400F.\n‚Ä¢ Gaming Goal: I primarily play AAA titles and want to hit Ultra settings with 60+ FPS (which is why I'm focusing on 1440p).\n‚Ä¢ Previous Experience: I have been using a large 4K TV at 60 Hz as a monitor. When I tried to play games at 2K resolution on the 4K TV, the image was often blurry (\"blurry\" or \"muddy\") or seemed to have visible pixels/aliasing when sitting close.\n‚Ä¢ Viewing Distance: I sit at arm's length from the screen. I need the image to look sharp and clean at this distance.\nI am looking for recommendations for specific models (preferably IPS or Mini LED for color) that offer the best panel quality, color gamut, and response time within the ‚Ç¨500 limit.\nThank you in advance for your help!",

At work, I use a 24+24 setup with my work laptop. \n\nWhile I like the simplicity of a single monitor, I like the dual monitor setup better for multi-tasking. I'm leaning toward a 31.5 as the primary and having the 24 or 27 as the secondary for coding, file management, etc. For aesthetic purposes, I like the 27+27 for matching monitors.\n\nFor those of you that do the same things I plan to do, what monitor combinations do you find work better than others? Why?\n\nThanks!",

But can you check it twice with your brightness high, I think it would appear more obvious when you look at the picture with high brightness.\n\nEdit 2: Guys, thank you so much for saying that I was wrong and I got lucky with my monitor.

The one or two reviews that I've read have been positive. The biggest issue with the monitor is that there is no audio jack or speakers.\n2.

But given my budget this is the best I can do. \n\n**Alternative:**\n\nI can sacrifice the soundbar and add the money saved to buy a better monitor (with in-built speakers, yes they are terrible), but at that new budget I am lost as to which one to buy.\n\n**PS:** \n\n1. Overall even though it is frustrating, honestly I actually learnt quite a lot things.  \n2. In case I missed something or got somethings wrong, I am not an expert so please don't bash me. \n\n",

Before the taskbar would have a few black lines and I was able to deal with it just fine, then after that these lines would show up on start up and would disappear after 20 minutes. It now takes hours to disappear or never at all. I've tried it on lower refresh rates where the green and red lines flicker a lot worse, and I've plugged my ps5 into it and the lines were still there so I'm pretty sure its a monitor issue.

Currently, I have a crappy little monitor and an even crappier square monitor as a second monitor that has the video quality of a potato. I'm planning on upgrading to a nicer main monitor.\n\nFor my second monitor, I've wanted to keep it small--I only really use it for youtube or having wikis pulled up. A second huge horizontal monitor seems overkill, and honestly would take up way more room on my desk than I want. In my perfect world, I'd have a small vertical monitor. I want it to have 2k visuals, but at this point, I don't think that's anywhere near in the cards for me.\n\nI, however, cannot find a single monitor in the universe which is not a literal barely-functioning screen built for an office that will fit. To fit a monitor vertically, it would have to have a width of less than 18.5\", which I've discovered virtually does not exist. To keep it from being huge, I have searched for any slightly higher quality square/4:3 monitors, but I have discovered that those, too, simply do not exist.\n\n(For reference, [this ](https://www.amazon.com/SKitphrati-Inch-Monitor-Color-Correction/dp/B09KZP5J3S?crid=1195BAY9HNYJA&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kzeFVrja8FuGmR_heQoYfU6b3pF6FLdqsySrsnU64-CbWrREzhzBIDevyNoT6zOQwDgkhjuN2sKd_rqwHN-GZCnmeJ8Qry2wJZZfMCJN1dr5L40An8-Zm30YbEjPvs2XvPxjpv0YigIzDduvRAQHXDzGCuDOr6oOZVPKWjFHvfoLRiG7ePvLlaWncLi0G6LpGXnk16-iqQzE1ZYjU3wmDuof0VbTtbEjo13p79cU6D4.SGFZbOIp2vQr2vh_Uzg4gyuunoiFBZC8uUpx17HTn10&dib_tag=se&keywords=square%2Bmonitor&qid=1761575338&sprefix=square%2Bmonito%2Caps%2C251&sr=8-4&th=1)is what I have right now. it works about as well as you'd think)\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations, or am I doomed to suffer eternally at the hands of my no-space desk?",

    "selftext": "Hi, pretty new to monitors in general as I've always just used a laptop. Been looking at some monitors to just use as an external display and not really sure on what to look for. I've seen videos, reviews and posts but it's quite a lot to take in. \n\n  \nMy main use will be for gaming and university (need some extra screen real estate) and the potential to pair up with a pc if I build one down the line. I don't really the best specs or anything but I hope that the monitor can be at least 120hz with good colours. Not too particular about viewing angles, ghosting or smearing, especially since I've always used the laptop display (60hz IPS) so I'm not too sure on what to expect.\n\n  \nI could potentially look for 27\" 1440p but I would like to stay with a 24\" due to a small desk, though I'm open to options.",

    "selftext": "After exhausting every troubleshooting step to get VRR/FreeSync working on a G-Sync Compatible monitor, it's reasonable to stop when the issue persists despite correctly applying all recommended settings\n. In many cases, especially with non-certified \"G-Sync Compatible\" setups, minor stutters can be inherent due to imperfect hardware or software implementations. \nWhen to give up\nYou should consider stopping when you've done all the following and still see no improvement:\n\n    Verified all basic setup requirements, including using a DisplayPort cable and ensuring VRR is enabled in your monitor's OSD, NVIDIA Control Panel, and in-game settings.\n    Applied advanced optimization techniques, such as capping your in-game frame rate a few frames below your monitor's maximum refresh rate and setting V-Sync to \"On\" in the NVIDIA Control Panel but \"Off\" in-game.\n    Investigated other software issues, like disabling overlays (such as NVIDIA's or the Xbox Game Bar), checking for background applications, and ensuring you have the latest drivers installed.\n    Performed a clean re-installation of drivers using a tool like DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller).\n    Accepted that the problem might be hardware-related. For instance, some users on OLED monitors report persistent VRR flicker that is unfixable, as it may be tied to the display technology itself. \n\nWhat to do instead\nIf you've given up on getting a flawless VRR experience, here are some alternatives to improve your gameplay:\n1. Cap your frame rate\nThis is often the most effective and simplest solution for avoiding stuttering and screen tearing.\n\n    Disable all adaptive sync in your monitor settings and the NVIDIA Control Panel.\n    Cap your frame rate in-game or using a tool like RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS) to your monitor's refresh rate (e.g., cap at 144 FPS for a 144 Hz monitor).\n    Turn V-Sync on in the NVIDIA Control Panel and in-game. This will eliminate screen tearing and keep frame times stable, though it may introduce some input lag. \n\n2. Use Fast Sync or Enhanced Sync\nThese are GPU driver features designed to reduce tearing and input lag without forcing a fixed refresh rate.\n\n    Enable Fast Sync (NVIDIA) or Enhanced Sync (AMD) in your GPU control panel instead of standard V-Sync.\n    Ensure adaptive sync is off. This can be a good compromise for competitive games where low input lag is a priority. \n\n3. Accept screen tearing\nFor competitive gamers who prioritize the absolute lowest input lag above all else, the standard practice is to:\n\n    Disable adaptive sync and V-Sync entirely.\n    This will allow your GPU to render frames as fast as possible, but you will experience screen tearing when your frame rate is out of sync with your monitor. \n\nThe bottom line\nYou've likely done all you can. The \"G-Sync Compatible\" label on some FreeSync monitors is an imperfect standard, and it's not uncommon for users to experience issues that a certified G-Sync module would prevent. The time and effort spent troubleshooting can reach a point of diminishing returns. The best path forward is to find a configuration that provides the best balance of smoothness and low input lag for your specific use case, even if that means abandoning VRR altogether. ",

They weren‚Äôt there before ‚Äî I came back from vacation and suddenly they appeared.\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe spots are not perfectly square, more like round shadows.\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf I look closely, I can see the individual pixels underneath.\n\t‚Ä¢\tSo far, three spots have appeared, and they seem to spread over time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI tried a stuck pixel fixer video for 15 minutes, but nothing changed.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? Could this be liquid/damage inside the panel, or is there any chance they might disappear on their own?\n\nThanks for any advice! üôè\n",

Priority: Best possible image quality (color accuracy, contrast) and overall performance for gaming. I want a smooth, crisp image.\nMy Current Setup & Context:\n‚Ä¢ PC Specs: NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti 16GB and Intel i5-13400F.\n‚Ä¢ Gaming Goal: I primarily play AAA titles and want to hit Ultra settings with 60+ FPS (which is why I'm focusing on 1440p).\n‚Ä¢ Previous Experience: I have been using a large 4K TV at 60 Hz as a monitor. When I tried to play games at 2K resolution on the 4K TV, the image was often blurry (\"blurry\" or \"muddy\") or seemed to have visible pixels/aliasing when sitting close.\n‚Ä¢ Viewing Distance: I sit at arm's length from the screen. I need the image to look sharp and clean at this distance.\nI am looking for recommendations for specific models (preferably IPS or Mini LED for color) that offer the best panel quality, color gamut, and response time within the ‚Ç¨500 limit.\nThank you in advance for your help!",

Mostly just for work (documents, email etc.) with some very occasional gaming.\n\nI use a dual computer setup: laptop for work, desktop for personal use. Laptop has a thunderbolt port. Desktop has a usb 3.1 port. \n\nMy current set up is dual dell 24‚Äô p2422h monitors (funded by my work a handful of years ago). I connect up to my laptop with hdmi ports and my pc separately. Have a usb switch for peripherals.\n\nLooking to replace with 27‚Äô monitors with a monitor arm and willing to spend a bit if it means a nicer experience given how much of my life I spend in here. Would be great to have a clean set up so I am somewhat interested in KVM built in, daisy chaining, etc. Thinking 4K monitors. \n\n1. The Dell U2725QE caught my eye‚Äîwas considering perhaps one of those and then perhaps a second 27‚Äô that is a bit cheaper. But I‚Äôve seen a lot of complaints about coil whine and it does sound like it is bad for gaming (although honestly I‚Äôve been fine on my current monitors so I can‚Äôt imagine this is a big issue).\n\n2. Recently came across the ASUS pro art PA27UCGE. Also pricy and I know it is mostly for colour-correct necessities like photo editing and video editing, but does seem to be very good all around. Perhaps one of these and then a second 27‚Äô that is a bit lower end?\n\nWelcoming thoughts and advice! ",

Now, just disregard audio quality completely. I'm just talking noise cancelling with ANC. How is it that airpod pro 3s beat the xm5 in noise cancellation with ANC on? I mean thats what the graph shows - much higher attentuation dBs for the APP3s compared to the XM5s. They do fizzle out near the high pitched end but im guessing that overears even without ANC are better in blocking out high freq noise because of the build material and clamping over ears. Seems like ANC doesnt make much of a difference for XM5s anyways on the high end. So my question is that ive seen all over the internet that overears + anc are always better than wireless earbuds (air pods). Why is this case different? Or am i a total idiot and i dont understand the graphs or the context. ",

But upon sitting at demo area, having exchanged a few pleasantries with the staff, their attitude quickly changed. Asking them about anything would yield a response that came across unbothered or sometimes annoyed.

Oh. Yeah, ok.\", \"Pick something else then.\"\n\nIt's not even just what they say or don't say, but it's how they say it. They really made me feel like they didn't want my business. Oddly they would only ever respond if you asked about the price. For such a niche hobby for enthusiasts, the staff at Addicted to Audio seem incredibly uninterested in audio at all. \n\nThe audio hobby is already so niche, rarely ever coming by others who share the interest. I'd like to enter an enthusiast store and meet other enthusiasts who actually care and want to share their love of audio. \n\nIf the staff are so uninterested then they should just work at Harvey Norman or JB HiFi where customers actually don't want to engage the staff. \n\nI'm an experienced audiophile with a fairly deep appreciation and budget. I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment. The local audiophile circle feel the same way and have since chosen to bring their business to Minidisc instead. ",

    "title": "Lets talk about the new Edition XV",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/it1hxzzqlrxf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=5912a58e06d71ad339cda4f905209e4b1052edb0\n\nI compared a few headphones a couple of days ago, and a lot of people wanted to hear more about the Edition XV. So let‚Äôs talk about it.\n\nAmong all the headphones I‚Äôve listened to, the closest one might be the Fiio FT1 Pro. The moment I put the Edition XV on, I instantly felt this warmth spreading through me ‚Äî like being wrapped in honey. You‚Äôll know what I mean once you try it.\n\n**Bass (before & after eq using oratory 1990's, the EQ didn't change the conclusion below)**\n\nThe most distinctive thing about the Edition XV, to my ears, is its **meaty bass**. It‚Äôs thick, elastic, and feels like it‚Äôs hugging the sides of your ears. It‚Äôs not the fast, clean kind of bass you get from the HE600. It‚Äôs the wet, creamy kind ‚Äî like your ears are being gently massaged with a cloth soaked in oil.\n\nThe bass also has more layers than the FT1 Pro, but the FT1 Pro‚Äôs bass FEELS more aggressive. It‚Äôs like a scholar delivering an insult ‚Äî refined, yet every word cuts deep. There‚Äôs more nuance and subtlety here, unlike the FT1 Pro, which just lashes out bluntly. Naturally, this makes the Edition XV sound a bit less aggressive at first. But if you listen closely, the impact is still there ‚Äî it just feels smoother and more full-bodied.\n\nThat said, not everyone listens critically all the time. When I‚Äôm just relaxing, I sometimes *feel* like the FT1 Pro has more bass (even though that‚Äôs not actually true if you listen critically when A/B them). I just want to bring this up because sometimes people would only describe stuff in their critical listening sessions, but headphones could feel VERY¬† different in daily casual listening.\n\n**Mids**\n\nNow, the mids. Vocals on the Edition XV are closer and more intimate than typical Hifiman models like the Arya Stealth or Edition XS, but still a bit farther away than on the FT1 Pro. The voice is rich, full, and slightly nasal. For female vocals, the singer can sound about ten years older than she actually is. That‚Äôs not necessarily good or bad ‚Äî it‚Äôs all down to taste.\n\nThe vocals lean on the darker side. Compared to the FT1 Pro, they‚Äôre more refined but also smoother ‚Äî which means you lose some of that raw texture in the voice, like the growls in the rock music. Personally, I prefer the FT1 Pro‚Äôs vocal texture; it carries more emotion like anger or passion. The Arya Stealth also feels more emotional than the Edition XV, but for a different reason ‚Äî it has more treble, more air, and that shimmer in the highs makes the vocals feel alive and vibrant. (You know those highs that vibrate with your skulls?)\n\nStill, the Edition XV has its own charm. A lot of 80s and 90s tracks ‚Äî songs like city pop ‚Äî take on a totally different vibe here. In fact, I‚Äôd describe the Edition XV as a **vibe** in itself. You know those days when you‚Äôre tired of all the crap and just want to chill, wrapped in a soft blanket, hugging a pillow? That‚Äôs what the Edition XV feels like. It won‚Äôt shock you, it won‚Äôt thrill you ‚Äî it just gives you that warm, steady, safe harbor you want to come home to.\n\n**Treble**\n\nThe treble is soft ‚Äî no sibilance, no sting. The FT1 Pro is more exciting in this area, which is why I think it‚Äôs the better all-rounder. The Edition XV, though, owns its signature mood completely.\n\n**Others**\n\nAs for soundstage ‚Äî the Edition XV‚Äôs lateral stage is narrower than its front-to-back depth. Sometimes the sound on both sides feels smeared onto a flat plane beside your ears, kind of vibrating there, which feels a bit unnatural. The FT1 Pro‚Äôs stage is even smaller, but it doesn‚Äôt have that issue.\n\nOverall, the Edition XV definitely has better detail retrieval and imaging than the FT1 Pro.\n\n**I wouldn't use a \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this headphone, since it is so special in the Hifiman lineup that I don't think there is any other hifiman headphone that can be compared with it. It is its own vibe, and if you can vibe with it, then it can probably beat those far more expensive headphones for you. If you can't (for example, you really enjoy other Hifiman lineups), it's really hard to say if you would enjoy it as much as others do.**\n\nHere is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1odsod7/comparison_between_he600_edition_xv_edition_xs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from a couple of days ago if you want to know more about my preference in sounds.",

    "selftext": "\nThe Hifiman Arya stealth are absurdly good for the price I got them at. At just below 500 dollars it‚Äôs the Ultimate endgame headphone for me. \n\nThe comfort is very nice. The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it‚Äôs Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth‚Äôs do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it‚Äôs a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it‚Äôs very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn‚Äôt too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren‚Äôt for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can‚Äôt wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now. Maybe later in life I‚Äôll upgrade but I know diminishing returns hit really hard after this so it‚Äôs a matter until I have some cash ready to burn. \n\n\n\n",

Absolutely gorgeous in the mid range and with a little EQ (+3db at 100hz) the bass feels a bit more full. What floors me about the RS2x‚Äôs is how natural instruments sound with them.

Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can‚Äôt imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these.

    "selftext": "I have been enjoying the Cambridge Audio Melomania ANC headphone for the past few weeks and decided to write up my review on my website. \n\nOverall it's a very comfortable ANC headphone with some decent EQ profiles, though the out of the box profile is a bit too bassy for my liking. But the App has lots of configuration options including some decent EQ profiles and a 7 band EQ editor. The ANC works very well in noisy environments but could dynamic ANC be better in quieter environments. \n\nAnyway, check out the full review if you are interested in this ANC headphone. ",

    "title": "Kefine Delci AE: When spectacularity becomes art",
    "selftext": "**Hello community!**\n\nHere I am again, writing another review, with my music playing and my extra long black coffee nice and hot, and, although I already had all my ideas organized in my head, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to give another listen to the model I present today: **Kefine Delci AE**, released in 2024.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present **my sources:**\n\n\\-FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.  \n\\-FiiO KA13 while working.  \n\\-FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.  \n\\-FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.  \n\\-FiiO KA11.  \n\\-FiiO JA11.  \n\\-Macbook Air M4 3.5mm output.  \n\\-Shanling M0 Pro. **NEW!!**  \n\\-Amazon Music Ultimate.  \n\\-Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons:**\n\n\\-Pros  \n\\>The most comfortable set I‚Äôve ever tried.  \n\\>Works very well with any source.  \n\\>Very wide soundstage in all three axes.  \n\\>Solid, fun, precise sub-bass and bass.  \n\\>Clear, present, and layered mids.\n\n\\-Cons:  \n\\>Cable connections are not interchangeable.  \n\\>The gold filter makes the high frequencies aggressive.  \n\\>Treble a little compressed.  \n\\>The cable slider doesn‚Äôt stay fixed.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis set of monitors was provided by the brand **Kefine** and **Mr. Yang**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.\n\nThe price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65‚Ç¨**.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn‚Äôt have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.\n\nMy surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle‚Ä¶ but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.\n\n\n\n**Will they meet my tastes?**\n\nFirst, let‚Äôs look at the **package contents:**\n\n\\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  \n\\-User **manual**.  \n\\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  \n\\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  \n\\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  \n\\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  \n\\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.\n\n\n\n**They look comfortable, right?**\n\nThis is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.\n\nThe answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn‚Äôt have started better.\n\nThe capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone‚Äôs auricle and ear canal.\n\nFor this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.\n\nThe cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn‚Äôt tangle, and doesn‚Äôt pull by catching on your clothing.\n\nI don‚Äôt know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.\n\nWhat I didn‚Äôt find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn‚Äôt fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.\n\n\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n\\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  \n\\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  \n\\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  \n\\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz\n\nThe **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.\n\nI would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.\n\n\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nThese **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.\n\nMy experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.\n\nI could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone‚Äôs intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.\n\nHowever, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.\n\n*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn‚Äôt the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.\n\n*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn‚Äôt interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.\n\n*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.\n\n*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don‚Äôt feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.\n\n*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.\n\n*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don‚Äôt need more, nor do I want it.\n\n*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors‚Äô tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.\n\n*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.\n\n*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.\n\n**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.\n\nRegarding **layering**: I don‚Äôt know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can‚Äôt believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.\n\n\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.\n\nI encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\nThe source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.\n\nIn the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.\n\nIn *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.\n\nRegarding Kratos‚Äô very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.\n\nIn the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn‚Äôt the highest resolution experience I‚Äôve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.\n\nThe child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.\n\nContinuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it‚Äôs the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*\n\nWell, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.\n\nNevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn‚Äôt the best for purists since listening wasn‚Äôt fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.\n\n\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI don‚Äôt want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I‚Äôve tested. At least up to the **100‚Ç¨/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what‚Äôs the point of spending more money?\n\nI acknowledge it isn‚Äôt perfect. In fact, technically, it‚Äôs inferior to two other competitors in its price range I‚Äôve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I‚Äôm not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.\n\nThey have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn‚Äôt hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.\n\nMy sincerest congratulations to the brand.\n\nThank you for reading if you‚Äôve made it this far.\n\n**See you in the next review.**\n\n**Greetings!**",

    "selftext": "I didn't expect much from Myer Audio, and I didn't really follow their work. The CKLVX D62 model is still popular, although it gets a lot more attention than it really deserves, I think; the SL41 MK2 one was excellent, but the next few models didn't seem to stand out in the stream of endless Chinese specialties.\n\nTherefore, I approached the next model, SLIIVO SL224, with minimum expectations. My loss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij95o9whopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2c35707a8bb0ad7bea5154dacf5740c96e62d49\n\nToday, we'll talk about SLIIVO SL224, in-ear headphones priced at $285 (as of October 2025).\n\n# All but the sound\n\nThe earphones are delivered in a cardboard box, normal-sized for the earphones of this price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46te32ckopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaf049b747a3e2612525251c1f342557f1e6e261\n\nIn the box, we can find the earphones themselves, a round leather case, 7 pairs of eartips, and a cable with replaceable connectors. No surprises.\n\nThe cable is beautiful, nice, with a resistance of 0.3 Ohms. The connectors are inserted and fixed to the cable with coarse-threaded nuts. This approach feels reliable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yq7y8nlopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e39369d65e608cae16450636cf618925bd366a2c\n\nIn addition to the 3.5 and 4.4 mm connectors, a Type-C connector was also included, which, of course, is not a connector at all, but a DAC. The DAC works exclusively in 16-bit/48 kHz mode, in Plug'n'play mode, with standard drivers in Windows 11, if nothing else. There are no special drivers on the [manufacturer's website](https://myeraudio.com/) (however, the website looks like it's being barely maintained, to put it mildly). The Walk Play app doesn't see it. But thanks for including it anyway.\n\nThere are 3 pairs of slightly tighter silicone eartips of a standard shape, sizes S, M and L...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xtkizhnopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1d969d57be38137156ba8de6bb85674f71f3ff\n\n...3 more pairs of slightly softer silicone eartips...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w63t0snoopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20fc14caa0167803e16403be6c068333bf719521\n\n...as well as 1 pair of foam ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy6v1cxpopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cca6a13136ec2ef430ce9374cb05ea4469a0a812\n\nThe earphones themselves are technically made on the basis of a menagerie of 2 dynamic (6 and 10 mm), 2 armature and 4 microplanar drivers, or a total of 8 drivers in each earphone. Each of the driver types plays back lower, middle, and upper frequencies, respectively.\n\nThe earphones' enclosures are made of polymer resin and have a pronounced relief, that is, ergonomic depressions and projections.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfydif6ropxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0e22a05e4a02671e7249bbe0040085de8fcb5d1\n\nThe earphones are designed for an average depth of the fit and have standard diameters of sound ducts by modern standards, so you can experiment with eartips at great length and with abandon: SpinFit CP100+, Pentaconn COREIR, Roseselsa SoundCocoon, Divinus Prism Wide Bore ‚Äì [they all](https://boizoff.com/eartips_part_4/) fit and let you comfortably place the earphones in your ears. I never managed to settle on anything specific, as they all are fine.\n\nI can't say anything bad about SL224 in terms of user experience and ergonomics ‚Äì they're just well-made modern in-ear headphones without any pitfalls. Of course, their black polished plastic surface scratches quickly and collects fingerprints, but that's how 99% of all headphones are made now, so there's nothing we can do. I can also complain about the case: for the earphones of this size and the cable of this length and thickness, this case is frankly small. Give me a bigger one now!\n\nAs for the electrical characteristics, the manufacturer claims a resistance of 36 Œ© and a sensitivity of 108 dB. I can't comment on the second value, but I've recently become able to measure resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vktmk7topxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0087afee237e878d735e0bae6214e181dd579035\n\nIt varies from 34 to 14 Œ©.\n\n# The sound\n\n*Standard links:*\n\n1. *the description of my rig is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/renovation-of-my-measuring-rig-for-headphones/)*;*\n2. *the audiogram of my hearing is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/audiogram/)*;*\n3. *articles on measurement theory and the whole shebang are* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/category/audiophile/theory/)*.*\n\nFrequency response of SLIIVO SL224 earphones with original foam eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hfl2191ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cea47660d534a586276350a062dc957e1a569d4\n\nAnd, before analyzing the frequency response, let me remind you that this frequency response will strongly depend on the depth of the fit. Frequency response of SL224 for the second resonance at 7000, 7500, 8000 and 8500 Hz:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lbyhjm2ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb404456030ce4a4c3f442905acc9d1c7a41284\n\nNote that there is no simple displacement of the resonant peak. On the contrary, the entire range from 3 to 20 kHz changes significantly, and only the emphasis at 12 kHz remains more or less stable in terms of volume and 'width', so to speak. The key thing that can be seen from these graphs is that the deeper the earphones are placed in the auditory canals, the lower the area before the second resonance 'droops' and the higher the peak rises around 15 kHz.\n\nComparison of frequency response for original foam and silicone eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg8uwbu4ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c2be14aaa3c3c99ba0cf535c6d00c6b7b3175bc\n\nAnyway, we can see the following on the graphs:\n\n* it seems to be a more or less typical sound delivery a la Harman;\n* but with reduced subbass;\n* and with a 'muffled', but rather 'smooth' 4-10 kHz segment;\n* as well as with an expansion after 10 kHz, the nature of which depends on the eartips. The graph obtained when using silicone eartips is more valid for my ears.\n\nBesides, consider a slight rise in the bass, about 250 Hz, as well as the shape of the 600 Hz to 3 kHz segment ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost linear. We'll talk below how this affects the SL224 sound perception.\n\nNonlinear distortion at 94 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g2c9x48ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=031fd6a69ca193c02a48b3996e51ed689a3e213e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrc4ao19ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3afce27b77c8e94f80bfa77f522bdc0e82f1eec\n\nNonlinear distortion at 104 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_1.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_1.jpg)\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_2.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_2.jpg)\n\nThere's not much to comment on here: at 94 dB, the distortion is just over 0.5% at the maximum; at 104 dB volume, it's over 1%. That is, they have no audible effect on the sound.\n\nMinimum phase response, group delay, and spectrogram in the 'Burst decay' mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kxxdhfdppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbabddd9448e7feaa7bfba5bd9e255749fba11db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfq42o6eppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=258891b29d856b4a4102a1ee88176893e93ffc2b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jadpkhseppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e62b9f7e963ddeb411d1c3629b85179cc9f17a3\n\nIt's a common near-ideal pattern, typical for all modern in-ears of a similar price.\n\nMy subjective evaluation is that I'm blown away primarily by how full-fledged the SL224 sound delivery turned out to be. And I deliberately don't use the word 'balanced' because it refers to the concept of neutrality. Literally everything in the sound of these earphones is in place. All frequencies are exactly in the amount that my ear personally expects. There is a very, very weighty, but technical subbass, a 'close' articulated middle with a hearing-friendly range at about 6-8 kHz, and an airy lightness after 10 kHz. It's very difficult to describe this sound because it's 'correct' and 'tasty' at the same time. In other words, you definitely won't be able to complain about tonal inaccuracy as it's at a very high level, but you also have this feeling of a 'spectacular' sound. It's difficult for me to clearly connect this with measurement graphs, but I assume that it's the linear range of 600-3000 Hz (and here we can move on to an endless debate about how to correctly combine frequency response graphs for comparison), as well as some emphasis on ultra-high frequencies that speak for themselves.\n\nA standalone interesting quality of these earphones, which I really appreciate and which is relatively rare, is the instrument sound separation. It's just splendid. You can listen to each vocal line, percussion, each component of the track separately and distinguish its perception from the overall musical flow.\n\nMoreover, the width of the sound stage is clearly larger than average. SL224 play in a large-scale, airy manner, and the recording space noticeably lives and breathes. The music plays 'around your head' and even more or less from behind rather than between your ears.\n\nAs one would expect with such sound delivery, these earphones are very versatile in terms of suitable musical content. The only limitation, apart from your taste, is the quality of tracks. If a sound engineer has been careful about recording and processing of the high frequency area, everything will be fine. If they haven't, you will be hearing weird and unpleasant things.\n\n# Comparisons\n\nIf we compare within the price category, guided by the [best online rating of in-ear monitors](https://boizoff.com/language/en/the-best-iems/), then the following models will be next to SL224:\n\n* PULA ANVIL 114\n* Letshuoer Cadenza 4\n* Kiwi Ears Orchestra Lite.\n\nI have compared them, of course, up-close and personal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1p7xn3ippxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0934c4bb516dc35126dc0ced23e9d82aefefd3ec\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to ANVIL 114: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_ANVIL114.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_ANVIL114.png)\n\nWhen A/B-ing, ANVIL 114 fully justify their name, hitting the listener's ears with a steel hammer: this is a massive, 'fat' sound supported by a bone conduction driver against the rather neutral, 'elegant' SL224 sound delivery.\n\n\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Cadenza 4: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Cadenza\\_4.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Cadenza_4.png)\n\nCadenza 4 are an example of excellent 'light' headphones. Compared to SL224, they have more 'top' and less 'bottom' in almost identical proportions. The Cadenza 4's sound delivery is 'airier', lighter, 'sparklier', and they have a slightly smoother section after 10 kHz, while SL224, again, are more neutral and, therefore, more versatile in comparison.\n\n\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Orchestra Lite: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Orchestra\\_Lite.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Orchestra_Lite.png)\n\nWe love Orchestra Lite for their infinitely expressive 'middle'. It seems that Orchestra Lite deliver sound even 'closer' to the listener, and they're a little brighter if we evaluate the sound delivery by and large, but SL224 win in terms of reliability and 'punch'.\n\n\n\nIf we look at the SL224 tuning conceptually, so to speak, then we need to compare them with completely different earphones ‚Äì [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/) and [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o78vvvipppxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ca90c5ee84b8406929c106d0d5555ef26ddc5b\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Meteor: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Meteor.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Meteor.png)\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Mega5-EST: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Mega5-EST.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Mega5-EST.png)\n\nAll three graphs compared:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mna3exppxf1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65aac9b4a17b9c969bac7fa6de31bcb38d5dc526\n\nCompared to Meteor, SL224 have a weightier bass and subbass due to a less pronounced middle; the Meteor sound seems sterile and faded against SL224. And, compared to Mega5-EST SL224, on the contrary, they're slightly less bassy, and the midrange is more pronounced. By ear, the SL224's sound delivery is almost perfectly equidistant from the tunings of these two models. The only thing that SL224 don't have is a smooth (by ear) frequency response after 10 kHz, which competitors can boast of. SL224 deliver this segment clearer, but less accurate. But prices vary accordingly, too.\n\nThe only aspect where I can name the best option for less money is gaming: from a positioning point of view, [KBEAR Cepheus](https://boizoff.com/language/en/kbear-cepheus-earphones-review/) remain unattainable and subjectively the best headphones for competitive games. But SL224 are also quite good in this context, don't get me wrong.\n\n# Summary\n\nI believe that the SL224's entry into the market is a significant milestone in the modern headphone industry. The SL224 is as iconic a model as [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/), [EPZ K9](https://boizoff.com/language/en/epz-k9-earphones-review/) or [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/) in their categories.\n\nAs for the sound‚Ä¶ I'm willing to pay to see the first reaction to the SL224 sound of someone for whom these earphones will be the first or second under the sun, as the wow effect from their first listening is so intense, and they differ so much from 'just headphones' and any TWS. SL224 are tuned just superbly: their sound delivery is simultaneously engaging, especially if you turn up the volume, but also reliable and large-scale in the sense of a virtual sound stage.\n\nWho won't like them? 'Bassheads' and fans of listening to music in the conditions of high ambient noise, that is, on the streets of a big city (noise masking will reduce the sound of these headphones to medium and high frequencies only).\n\nTo buy or not to buy? To buy!  \n",

Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones. I'd certainly like to hear the top-end Sony R10s or something like the Spirit Torino Valkyria and there are plenty of planar headphones out there..",

However, I am experiencing some extremely harsh, sharp and painful kind of sibilance to some vocals on some tracks. For example from 1:43-1:55 on Duckworth by Kendrick Lamar. This happens mostly on s-sounds.\n\nI found that I had to meticulously EQ around 9800 Hz (q factor of 3), reducing it by around 6-7 dB in order to get rid of this painful sound. However, I find that doing this makes the overall sound more dull, dark and less defined. I'm not sure what to do.

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI know the question is odd since it's a open vs closed back DCA, however I am in the market for a new set. For my listening tastes, my 6XX doesn't cut it. I then got a planar FT1 Pro and the widened soundstage is nice, but I hate certain aspects of the headphones (including the stock pads and putting on some Dekoni LCD-type pads certainly changed the headphones too much) and I find it really sounds bad when I drive them with EQ that brings it closer to Harman. The dips I can hear in 2K-5K is very annoying to try and EQ properly and I haven't been able to make it right with the new pads; they're either distant or very grating.\n\nConversly, I noticed that once I tuned my 6XX's close to Harman using ortary's EQ, I vastly enjoyed the sound more, but the technical aspects of the 6XX's were starting to bug me, like the lack of Impact of bass and the narrow soundstage,\n\nHence my look into DCA's more Harman tuned headphones. I have heard very good things about E3, namely that it has a vast sound-stage for a closed back, large drivers/earcups (I do have a big fuggin head), etc. etc. However, now that I see that the Noire XO is out for several hundred less, I am also looking at these, namely on DMS' recommendation and his bit about \"if you LPF after 10k, you effectively get E3\". Pair the Noire XO's promising looking bass response, I am at a bit of a decision paralysis between the two for an end-game desktop setup.\n\nSo, for people that have listened to one or the other, is the E3 worth it for the extra money vs the Noire XO in your own personal opinion? What about for someone like myself that wants a more Harman tuned, wider soundstage headphone? It's one thing to say \"has a wide soundstage for a closed back\", but then how does it compare to an actual open back in the Noire XO?\n\nThanks! :)\n\ne; I also don't live anywhere near a place to test each.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

I stopped using these headphones about a year ago. The ear cups I've changed multiple times in the past, that's not that much of an issue. The yellowing of the white plastic is also expected (these are from literally the first batch of Virtuosos when they were just released in 2019). BUT THE HEADBAND! The headband started peeling off not that long ago and then it started to quickly deteriorate after that. I stopped using the Virtuoso and started using my Raycons instead, then I got my Nothing Ear. They have been ok, but at the same time, the Virtuoso is there in a corner, forgotten and neglected, but it is an amazing headset and I'd really like to get back to using it.\n\n  \nThey still work! I haven't put them on for obvious reasons (they have of course gotten much worse after not being touched for a while in a humid environment), but they still work.  \nI do not need headphones. I don't even game anymore. But sometimes I just want to use them and I can't in their current state.\n\nI also want to note I'm neither an audiophile nor a consumerist, and that's why I wouldn't even consider replacing them instead of just fixing them up a little bit if they still work just fine.",

The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else.

I just like music and love a good deal.\n\nThe Edifier WH950NB likely need no introduction; they launched for ‚Ç¨150 in Europe two years ago, have been around ‚Ç¨110 for a long time, and the white model has dipped to ‚Ç¨71 for a week a few months ago. I bought them on launch, and waited for a long time to form my opinion.\n\nI commute a few hours with them daily, and charge them once a week. I'm coming from a Hifiman Deva Pro, Sennheiser HD58X, and HD560S. I cannot overstate it: these headphones are phenomenal. Not \"good enough for Bluetooth headphones\", no, I often use them as my preferred listening experience over the others.\n\nHere's the secret: you get a (somewhat restricted) parametric EQ in the Edifier app. However, I created a preset from data (and my ears) that sounds so, so much better than the default tuning (see attached image for graphs):\n\n39Hz -3dB 2.0 (Optional)\n\n3000Hz -8dB 2.0\n\n3300Hz 3dB 2.0\n\n9000Hz 3dB 0.5\n\nIf you use UAPP on Android you can do automatic sample rate switching so you bypass Android's resampler on LDAC, and with some extra parametric EQ bands in UAPP you can improve the sound signature slightly more (I can add my preset in a comment if anyone is interested).\n\nOther than sound signature, these do everything you'd expect from a modern pair of BT headphones. There's passive and active 3.5mm support, a massive two-week battery, multiple ANC modes, multi-point Bluetooth 5.3, 96/32 LDAC, safe volume limiter, low latency mode, theater surround sound mode, and most importantly, an amazing travel case with a bunch of accessoires included (airplane splitter, usb-c cable, 3.5mm L-shape cable, protection pad for the folded cup).\n\nGenuinely wondering how no one is talking about these. Some of my family members, friends and colleagues bought one on my recommendation and they all think it's an amazing product. I only hear about the ‚Ç¨300+ products from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser etc.\n\nIs there anyone else that has these?\n\nEdit: Formatting",

You can find it [here](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/aune-n7.28592/reviews).\n\n# Aune N7 Review ‚Äî Mojo 2 Finds Its Match\n\nAfter upgrading to the Hifiman Arya Stealth, I wanted a proper Class A amp to bring out their full potential. I‚Äôve long used the Chord Mojo 2 as my main DAC/amp ‚Äî a brilliant device ‚Äî but I suspected pairing it with a pure Class A amp might unlock something new. Enter the **Aune N7**.\n\n# Build & Design\n\nCompact, solid, and purposeful ‚Äî the **N7**‚Äôs machined aluminum chassis with side heat fins looks serious and feels premium. The **volume knob** clicks smoothly but can skip if turned too fast. The **aluminum remote** feels fantastic, though its **volume buttons** could be better placed.  \nThe **display** is functional but small; no brightness control. As expected from a Class A amp, it runs warm ‚Äî hand-warmer warm, not egg-frying hot. The internal temperature stays around 45¬∞C even after long sessions.\n\n# Listening Setup\n\n**Chain:** Spotify Lossless ‚Üí WiiM Mini ‚Üí Mojo 2 ‚Üí Aune N7 ‚Üí Hifiman Arya Stealth (balanced out, high gain/high current).\n\n# Sound Impressions\n\n* **Steely Dan ‚Äì ‚ÄúAja‚Äù**: The N7 adds depth and weight, expanding the soundstage front-to-back. Bass gains texture; cymbals smooth out; the sax solo feels more alive. Some upper-mid sparkle is softened, but the trade-off is cohesion.\n* **Bill Evans Trio ‚Äì ‚ÄúSunday at the Village Vanguard‚Äù**: The sense of space and realism jumps. You don‚Äôt just hear LaFaro‚Äôs bass ‚Äî you feel it resonate. Evans‚Äô piano takes on body and warmth, and brushwork on the snare is wonderfully tactile.\n* **Snarky Puppy ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe Like It Here‚Äù**: A perfect showcase for the N7‚Äôs Class A dynamics. Everything stays tight and layered even in dense sections. You lose a touch of bite on transients, but gain richness and flow.\n* **Martha Argerich ‚Äì Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3**: The Mojo alone is precise but dry. Add the N7 and the sound breathes ‚Äî the piano has weight and the hall ambience comes alive.\n* **Entheogenic ‚Äì ‚ÄúDreamtime Physics‚Äù**: Electronica gains dimension and slam. Sub-bass digs deeper, highs shimmer smoothly, and the sound feels enveloping. The N7‚Äôs black background lets microdetails emerge effortlessly.\n\n# Tonal Character\n\nThe **N7** sits between **neutral and warm**, adding body without syrup. It turns the Mojo 2‚Äôs clinical precision into a more natural, organic presentation ‚Äî like switching from a microscope to a beautifully developed photo. Mids are dense, bass tight, highs extended yet smooth.\n\n# Noise & Power\n\nAbsolutely silent, even at high gain. The Arya Stealth reaches satisfying levels around 10‚Äì15/30 volume steps, leaving plenty of headroom. Rated at **6.5W @ 32Œ© balanced**, the N7 drives demanding planars effortlessly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe **Aune N7** is a **$399 Class A gem** ‚Äî compact, powerful, and genuinely musical. It transforms the Mojo 2 from analytical to alive, and makes the Arya Stealth sound more organic and fatigue-free.  \nIf you want long, engaging sessions and real Class A smoothness without spending big or cluttering your desk, this is the one. Mine‚Äôs staying put ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the best endorsement I can give.",

    "selftext": "**Without EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth: best all rounder, widest soundstage, great imaging, superior separation, hefty bass\n2. Arya Stealth: sterile, thin sounding, decent bass\n3. HE6se V2: less refined than Arya Stealth, very neutral and clinical, honky and boxy telephone-like sound (some may prefer this), very fast and dynamic.\n\n**With EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth (does not require EQ): still the best allrounder\n2. HE6se V2: very natural and smooth, great 3D sound with slightly less stage size than Arya Sealth, more weight and slam, excellent midrange, amazing separation\n3. Arya Stealth: fuller and richer but less emphasis than HE6 in many ways, slightly more balanced and smoother, good overall sound for a number of different use cases\n\nBoth the HE6se V2 (EQ'd) and HE1000 Stealth trade blows. It's definitely no slouch and ever so slightly prefer it over the HE1000 Stealth with certain genres such as rock and metal. For everything else including classical music, and videogame/movie OST's such as LOTR, Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 etc. the HE1000 Stealth is the overall winner, including Rap and Hip-Hop.\n\nThe most noticeable factors of the HE1000 Stealth over the Arya Stealth is note weight and staging. Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be ¬£3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

However, I do listen to lots of metal, and in some tracks, especially more chaotic with lots going on or just old and badly mixed - Aryas get a little bit harsh. Equalizer works great but it also kinda kills the beautiful detail on other songs, so it feels like a compromise. I can get used to switching equalizer settings but I can also afford another pair of headphones, that would be used for more casual listening or metal in general. \n\nBudget is flexible if it's worth it. I've been thinking about HD490Pro or HD660S2 (listened to both in a shop nearby, sounded nice and relaxed, but plastic build felt a bit cheap), maybe audeze LCD-2c (didn't get to listen to). It has to be different to be worth it, probably warmer, more forgiving, less harsh, but still a good hi-fi headphones. Any opinions are welcome!",

Regardless of what experts, reviews or anyone what is saying: what is your perfect pair of headphones? \n\nI used to have a pair of first generation Sennheiser Momentum but then due to working from home and getting a Jabra Evolve 75 SE from my company for calls I stopped using them and somehow lost them. \n\nRecently there came a point, though, where I got sick and tired from listening to music on them. I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring.

    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it‚Äôs tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For ‚Äúheavier‚Äù music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that‚Äôs clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It‚Äôs an excellent headphone and if you don‚Äôt AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

    "title": "CCA CRA+: pure fun at a ridiculous price.",
    "selftext": "Hello Community!\n\nThis time it's the review of a low-cost product, but just because it costs little money doesn't mean we should forget about this range. In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO JA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**‚Ç¨13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 ‚Ç¨/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of ‚Ç¨30 than one of ‚Ç¨100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶let's start with the **package content:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† User manual\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the ‚Ç¨13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but‚Ä¶ the highs got easily out of control‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶ I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is‚Ä¶ somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child‚Äôs voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors‚Äô behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies‚Äô guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **‚Ç¨13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n¬†",

    "title": "Which noise canceling headphones do you prefer?",
    "selftext": "Hope I got the right flair. Been Lurking here sometime. I‚Äôm About to make a job change to wfh and decided last week I‚Äôd get myself a Christmas present of noise cancellation, over the ear headphone to reduce those outside distractions while I‚Äôm trying to concentrate and focus. \n\n4 or 7 years or so ago the wife and I were goofing in a mall and visiting a crowded Apple Store for some reason. We live in a rural area and it‚Äôs two hours to the nearest so it‚Äôs a novel event and we wandered around checking out everything . Outside of some Bose about 15+ years ago, I‚Äôve never had occasion to be near NC Headphones. \n\nAnyway, I popped these on and EVERYTHING went dead silent. Best of all, my wife‚Äôs voice, right in front of my face trying to talk to me. Reminded me of that scene in, I think, Face Off with travolta and cage where someone drops headphones of soothing music on the little 4 yr old kid and then a huge gun battle breaks out. In that crazy, crowded, noisy store I heard nothing but soft cool jazz. I could see my wife‚Äôs lips moving but could hear a word and it was pure bliss. Not sure which model I had but they were like $500+ at the time. \n\nQ: Anything BETTER, or cheaper yet still super isolating and effective these days? How would I go about trying other models out? \n\nAlso appreciate advice on replacing ear pads, battery life, overall longevity of devices. ",

Yeah the highs are crisp, and I'll admit footsteps sound good, but I'm not getting the same emersive factor that I was getting from the nova pros. For example jumping out the plane in warzone the wind and engine sounded like it was actually up in your face if that makes sense, but with the Maxwells it just sounds thinned out. I have Atmos and the latest firmware installed and yes I tweaked with the EQ. Is there something I'm missing here?",

Especially the high-quality bass. But one thing that made me really happy as a customer is the accessories you get. When I bought much more expensive headphones, they don't treat you as good as FiiO. You get the regular 3.5mm cable with 6.35mm adapter but also a premium looking case and A BALANCED 4.4MM CABLE! Amazing headphones with amazing accessories. all for an amazing price. It's super convenient because I always wanted a balanced cable for my HD 600 and Edition XS but they are quite expensive. The fact that FiiO included them is just really nice. Now I can use them for my Edition XS without having to go out and look and spend money on them.\n\nThis really reminds me of how cheap smartphones gives you more than $1000 smartphones. You get a screen protector already applied, a free phone case included in the box and of course a should-be-mandatory charging brick. But for $1000 you don't even get a charger, like how is a dude gonna charge the damn phone???",

Instead, they delivered a flimsy build, muddy audio, and abysmal customer service, making this purchase a complete letdown.\nDurability: Shockingly Fragile\nThe website claims the H1H survived 1.8m drops onto hard floors, but this is a blatant lie. My headphones‚Äô headband snapped in two after a mere 0.4m drop onto a soft carpeted floor. For a premium product, this fragility is outrageous. The 308g weight also made them uncomfortable for extended wear, and the satin finish attracted fingerprints, further cheapening the experience.\n\nCustomer Service: Insulting Response,\n\nWhen I contacted Heavys about the broken headband, their response was slow and unhelpful. After days of generic emails, they offered a 25% discount on another purchase. Why would I buy a faulty product again? This dismissive attitude left me feeling cheated and ignored.\n\nSound and Features: Substandard,\n\nThe sound was bass-heavy and muddy, burying vocals and guitars in tracks like Iron Maiden‚Äôs Run to the Hills. The app‚Äôs EQ barely helped, and the soundstage felt cramped. The ‚ÄúHell Blocker‚Äù noise cancellation was ineffective against basic background noise, and clunky buttons made adjustments a hassle.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Heavys H1H are a massive disappointment. A fragile build, false durability claims, poor sound, and insulting customer service make these headphones a waste of money. Metal fans, steer clear and invest in something reliable.",

But upon sitting at demo area, having exchanged a few pleasantries with the staff, their attitude quickly changed. Asking them about anything would yield a response that came across unbothered or sometimes annoyed. Sometimes the staff outright ignored me, completely unbothered, clicking away on his phone/laptop when the room is completely silent and just the two of us, when I made a comment or asked a question. \n\nI've gotten responses like \"Huh? Oh. Yeah, ok.\", \"Pick something else then.\"\n\nIt's not even just what they say or don't say, but it's how they say it. They really made me feel like they didn't want my business. Oddly they would only ever respond if you asked about the price. For such a niche hobby for enthusiasts, the staff at Addicted to Audio seem incredibly uninterested in audio at all. \n\nThe audio hobby is already so niche, rarely ever coming by others who share the interest. I'd like to enter an enthusiast store and meet other enthusiasts who actually care and want to share their love of audio. \n\nIf the staff are so uninterested then they should just work at Harvey Norman or JB HiFi where customers actually don't want to engage the staff. \n\nI'm an experienced audiophile with a fairly deep appreciation and budget. I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment. The local audiophile circle feel the same way and have since chosen to bring their business to Minidisc instead. ",

Absolutely gorgeous in the mid range and with a little EQ (+3db at 100hz) the bass feels a bit more full. What floors me about the RS2x‚Äôs is how natural instruments sound with them. Jazz, rock‚Äîpretty much anything with actual instruments sounds incredible. Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can‚Äôt imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these. They‚Äôre far from neutral but if you like the way they color music Grados are some of the best cans. After 15+ years of experience with their headphones I feel like I have ‚Äúarrived‚Äù with these and my modest budget audiophile set up. \n\nThe HiFimans are a delight as well. Far more neutral, but man can they be EQed. No distortion with any level of reasonable EQ on the bass so if I want to put on some electronic music and blast some chunky thick bass directly into my brain, these are the cans to do it. While I definitely use the Grados more, these are an amazing second set to have at my desk for when I listen to music that the Grados aren‚Äôt well suited for. (Not that other music sounds /bad/ on them, it‚Äôs just not what they excel at.)\n\nNone of my friends are big into audio and they‚Äôve heard me rant about my cans probably more times they can count so I thought I‚Äôd dump my thoughts and adoration of my set up here. \n\nFeel free to share your desktop set up‚Äôs as well I‚Äôd love to see what other people are working with, gear-wise. \n",

Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones.

The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it‚Äôs Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth‚Äôs do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it‚Äôs a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it‚Äôs very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn‚Äôt too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren‚Äôt for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can‚Äôt wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now. Maybe later in life I‚Äôll upgrade but I know diminishing returns hit really hard after this so it‚Äôs a matter until I have some cash ready to burn. \n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Lets talk about the new Edition XV",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/it1hxzzqlrxf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=5912a58e06d71ad339cda4f905209e4b1052edb0\n\nI compared a few headphones a couple of days ago, and a lot of people wanted to hear more about the Edition XV. So let‚Äôs talk about it.\n\nAmong all the headphones I‚Äôve listened to, the closest one might be the Fiio FT1 Pro. The moment I put the Edition XV on, I instantly felt this warmth spreading through me ‚Äî like being wrapped in honey. You‚Äôll know what I mean once you try it.\n\n**Bass (before & after eq using oratory 1990's, the EQ didn't change the conclusion below)**\n\nThe most distinctive thing about the Edition XV, to my ears, is its **meaty bass**. It‚Äôs thick, elastic, and feels like it‚Äôs hugging the sides of your ears. It‚Äôs not the fast, clean kind of bass you get from the HE600. It‚Äôs the wet, creamy kind ‚Äî like your ears are being gently massaged with a cloth soaked in oil.\n\nThe bass also has more layers than the FT1 Pro, but the FT1 Pro‚Äôs bass FEELS more aggressive. It‚Äôs like a scholar delivering an insult ‚Äî refined, yet every word cuts deep. There‚Äôs more nuance and subtlety here, unlike the FT1 Pro, which just lashes out bluntly. Naturally, this makes the Edition XV sound a bit less aggressive at first. But if you listen closely, the impact is still there ‚Äî it just feels smoother and more full-bodied.\n\nThat said, not everyone listens critically all the time. When I‚Äôm just relaxing, I sometimes *feel* like the FT1 Pro has more bass (even though that‚Äôs not actually true if you listen critically when A/B them). I just want to bring this up because sometimes people would only describe stuff in their critical listening sessions, but headphones could feel VERY¬† different in daily casual listening.\n\n**Mids**\n\nNow, the mids. Vocals on the Edition XV are closer and more intimate than typical Hifiman models like the Arya Stealth or Edition XS, but still a bit farther away than on the FT1 Pro. The voice is rich, full, and slightly nasal. For female vocals, the singer can sound about ten years older than she actually is. That‚Äôs not necessarily good or bad ‚Äî it‚Äôs all down to taste.\n\nThe vocals lean on the darker side. Compared to the FT1 Pro, they‚Äôre more refined but also smoother ‚Äî which means you lose some of that raw texture in the voice, like the growls in the rock music. Personally, I prefer the FT1 Pro‚Äôs vocal texture; it carries more emotion like anger or passion. The Arya Stealth also feels more emotional than the Edition XV, but for a different reason ‚Äî it has more treble, more air, and that shimmer in the highs makes the vocals feel alive and vibrant. (You know those highs that vibrate with your skulls?)\n\nStill, the Edition XV has its own charm. A lot of 80s and 90s tracks ‚Äî songs like city pop ‚Äî take on a totally different vibe here. In fact, I‚Äôd describe the Edition XV as a **vibe** in itself. You know those days when you‚Äôre tired of all the crap and just want to chill, wrapped in a soft blanket, hugging a pillow? That‚Äôs what the Edition XV feels like. It won‚Äôt shock you, it won‚Äôt thrill you ‚Äî it just gives you that warm, steady, safe harbor you want to come home to.\n\n**Treble**\n\nThe treble is soft ‚Äî no sibilance, no sting. The FT1 Pro is more exciting in this area, which is why I think it‚Äôs the better all-rounder. The Edition XV, though, owns its signature mood completely.\n\n**Others**\n\nAs for soundstage ‚Äî the Edition XV‚Äôs lateral stage is narrower than its front-to-back depth. Sometimes the sound on both sides feels smeared onto a flat plane beside your ears, kind of vibrating there, which feels a bit unnatural. The FT1 Pro‚Äôs stage is even smaller, but it doesn‚Äôt have that issue.\n\nOverall, the Edition XV definitely has better detail retrieval and imaging than the FT1 Pro.\n\n**I wouldn't use a \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this headphone, since it is so special in the Hifiman lineup that I don't think there is any other hifiman headphone that can be compared with it. It is its own vibe, and if you can vibe with it, then it can probably beat those far more expensive headphones for you. If you can't (for example, you really enjoy other Hifiman lineups), it's really hard to say if you would enjoy it as much as others do.**\n\nHere is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1odsod7/comparison_between_he600_edition_xv_edition_xs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from a couple of days ago if you want to know more about my preference in sounds.",

    "selftext": "These have supplanted the Sennheiser HD6xx as my favorite open back and the one I use daily. The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else. I would be perfectly happy with these as my open back and Aeon Closed RT as my closed back for the forseeable future.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

Now, just disregard audio quality completely. I'm just talking noise cancelling with ANC. How is it that airpod pro 3s beat the xm5 in noise cancellation with ANC on? I mean thats what the graph shows - much higher attentuation dBs for the APP3s compared to the XM5s. They do fizzle out near the high pitched end but im guessing that overears even without ANC are better in blocking out high freq noise because of the build material and clamping over ears. Seems like ANC doesnt make much of a difference for XM5s anyways on the high end. So my question is that ive seen all over the internet that overears + anc are always better than wireless earbuds (air pods). Why is this case different? Or am i a total idiot and i dont understand the graphs or the context. ",

    "selftext": "**Hello community!**\n\nHere I am again, writing another review, with my music playing and my extra long black coffee nice and hot, and, although I already had all my ideas organized in my head, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to give another listen to the model I present today: **Kefine Delci AE**, released in 2024.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present **my sources:**\n\n\\-FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.  \n\\-FiiO KA13 while working.  \n\\-FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.  \n\\-FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.  \n\\-FiiO KA11.  \n\\-FiiO JA11.  \n\\-Macbook Air M4 3.5mm output.  \n\\-Shanling M0 Pro. **NEW!!**  \n\\-Amazon Music Ultimate.  \n\\-Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons:**\n\n\\-Pros  \n\\>The most comfortable set I‚Äôve ever tried.  \n\\>Works very well with any source.  \n\\>Very wide soundstage in all three axes.  \n\\>Solid, fun, precise sub-bass and bass.  \n\\>Clear, present, and layered mids.\n\n\\-Cons:  \n\\>Cable connections are not interchangeable.  \n\\>The gold filter makes the high frequencies aggressive.  \n\\>Treble a little compressed.  \n\\>The cable slider doesn‚Äôt stay fixed.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis set of monitors was provided by the brand **Kefine** and **Mr. Yang**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.\n\nThe price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65‚Ç¨**.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn‚Äôt have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.\n\nMy surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle‚Ä¶ but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.\n\n\n\n**Will they meet my tastes?**\n\nFirst, let‚Äôs look at the **package contents:**\n\n\\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  \n\\-User **manual**.  \n\\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  \n\\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  \n\\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  \n\\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  \n\\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.\n\n\n\n**They look comfortable, right?**\n\nThis is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.\n\nThe answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn‚Äôt have started better.\n\nThe capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone‚Äôs auricle and ear canal.\n\nFor this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.\n\nThe cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn‚Äôt tangle, and doesn‚Äôt pull by catching on your clothing.\n\nI don‚Äôt know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.\n\nWhat I didn‚Äôt find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn‚Äôt fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.\n\n\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n\\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  \n\\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  \n\\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  \n\\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz\n\nThe **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.\n\nI would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.\n\n\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nThese **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.\n\nMy experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.\n\nI could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone‚Äôs intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.\n\nHowever, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.\n\n*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn‚Äôt the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.\n\n*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn‚Äôt interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.\n\n*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.\n\n*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don‚Äôt feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.\n\n*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.\n\n*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don‚Äôt need more, nor do I want it.\n\n*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors‚Äô tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.\n\n*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.\n\n*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.\n\n**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.\n\nRegarding **layering**: I don‚Äôt know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can‚Äôt believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.\n\n\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.\n\nI encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\nThe source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.\n\nIn the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.\n\nIn *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.\n\nRegarding Kratos‚Äô very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.\n\nIn the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn‚Äôt the highest resolution experience I‚Äôve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.\n\nThe child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.\n\nContinuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it‚Äôs the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*\n\nWell, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.\n\nNevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn‚Äôt the best for purists since listening wasn‚Äôt fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.\n\n\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI don‚Äôt want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I‚Äôve tested. At least up to the **100‚Ç¨/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what‚Äôs the point of spending more money?\n\nI acknowledge it isn‚Äôt perfect. In fact, technically, it‚Äôs inferior to two other competitors in its price range I‚Äôve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I‚Äôm not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.\n\nThey have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn‚Äôt hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.\n\nMy sincerest congratulations to the brand.\n\nThank you for reading if you‚Äôve made it this far.\n\n**See you in the next review.**\n\n**Greetings!**",

But the App has lots of configuration options including some decent EQ profiles and a 7 band EQ editor. The ANC works very well in noisy environments but could dynamic ANC be better in quieter environments. \n\nAnyway, check out the full review if you are interested in this ANC headphone. ",

    "title": "Aune N7 Class A Headphone Amp - Stunning Power and Value",
    "selftext": "Here's a trimmed down version of my full review over on head-fi. You can find it [here](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/aune-n7.28592/reviews).\n\n# Aune N7 Review ‚Äî Mojo 2 Finds Its Match\n\nAfter upgrading to the Hifiman Arya Stealth, I wanted a proper Class A amp to bring out their full potential. I‚Äôve long used the Chord Mojo 2 as my main DAC/amp ‚Äî a brilliant device ‚Äî but I suspected pairing it with a pure Class A amp might unlock something new. Enter the **Aune N7**.\n\n# Build & Design\n\nCompact, solid, and purposeful ‚Äî the **N7**‚Äôs machined aluminum chassis with side heat fins looks serious and feels premium. The **volume knob** clicks smoothly but can skip if turned too fast. The **aluminum remote** feels fantastic, though its **volume buttons** could be better placed.  \nThe **display** is functional but small; no brightness control. As expected from a Class A amp, it runs warm ‚Äî hand-warmer warm, not egg-frying hot. The internal temperature stays around 45¬∞C even after long sessions.\n\n# Listening Setup\n\n**Chain:** Spotify Lossless ‚Üí WiiM Mini ‚Üí Mojo 2 ‚Üí Aune N7 ‚Üí Hifiman Arya Stealth (balanced out, high gain/high current).\n\n# Sound Impressions\n\n* **Steely Dan ‚Äì ‚ÄúAja‚Äù**: The N7 adds depth and weight, expanding the soundstage front-to-back. Bass gains texture; cymbals smooth out; the sax solo feels more alive. Some upper-mid sparkle is softened, but the trade-off is cohesion.\n* **Bill Evans Trio ‚Äì ‚ÄúSunday at the Village Vanguard‚Äù**: The sense of space and realism jumps. You don‚Äôt just hear LaFaro‚Äôs bass ‚Äî you feel it resonate. Evans‚Äô piano takes on body and warmth, and brushwork on the snare is wonderfully tactile.\n* **Snarky Puppy ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe Like It Here‚Äù**: A perfect showcase for the N7‚Äôs Class A dynamics. Everything stays tight and layered even in dense sections. You lose a touch of bite on transients, but gain richness and flow.\n* **Martha Argerich ‚Äì Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3**: The Mojo alone is precise but dry. Add the N7 and the sound breathes ‚Äî the piano has weight and the hall ambience comes alive.\n* **Entheogenic ‚Äì ‚ÄúDreamtime Physics‚Äù**: Electronica gains dimension and slam. Sub-bass digs deeper, highs shimmer smoothly, and the sound feels enveloping. The N7‚Äôs black background lets microdetails emerge effortlessly.\n\n# Tonal Character\n\nThe **N7** sits between **neutral and warm**, adding body without syrup. It turns the Mojo 2‚Äôs clinical precision into a more natural, organic presentation ‚Äî like switching from a microscope to a beautifully developed photo. Mids are dense, bass tight, highs extended yet smooth.\n\n# Noise & Power\n\nAbsolutely silent, even at high gain. The Arya Stealth reaches satisfying levels around 10‚Äì15/30 volume steps, leaving plenty of headroom. Rated at **6.5W @ 32Œ© balanced**, the N7 drives demanding planars effortlessly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe **Aune N7** is a **$399 Class A gem** ‚Äî compact, powerful, and genuinely musical. It transforms the Mojo 2 from analytical to alive, and makes the Arya Stealth sound more organic and fatigue-free.  \nIf you want long, engaging sessions and real Class A smoothness without spending big or cluttering your desk, this is the one. Mine‚Äôs staying put ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the best endorsement I can give.",

    "title": "In the market: DCA Noire XO or E3?",
    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI know the question is odd since it's a open vs closed back DCA, however I am in the market for a new set. For my listening tastes, my 6XX doesn't cut it. I then got a planar FT1 Pro and the widened soundstage is nice, but I hate certain aspects of the headphones (including the stock pads and putting on some Dekoni LCD-type pads certainly changed the headphones too much) and I find it really sounds bad when I drive them with EQ that brings it closer to Harman. The dips I can hear in 2K-5K is very annoying to try and EQ properly and I haven't been able to make it right with the new pads; they're either distant or very grating.\n\nConversly, I noticed that once I tuned my 6XX's close to Harman using ortary's EQ, I vastly enjoyed the sound more, but the technical aspects of the 6XX's were starting to bug me, like the lack of Impact of bass and the narrow soundstage,\n\nHence my look into DCA's more Harman tuned headphones. I have heard very good things about E3, namely that it has a vast sound-stage for a closed back, large drivers/earcups (I do have a big fuggin head), etc. etc. However, now that I see that the Noire XO is out for several hundred less, I am also looking at these, namely on DMS' recommendation and his bit about \"if you LPF after 10k, you effectively get E3\". Pair the Noire XO's promising looking bass response, I am at a bit of a decision paralysis between the two for an end-game desktop setup.\n\nSo, for people that have listened to one or the other, is the E3 worth it for the extra money vs the Noire XO in your own personal opinion? What about for someone like myself that wants a more Harman tuned, wider soundstage headphone? It's one thing to say \"has a wide soundstage for a closed back\", but then how does it compare to an actual open back in the Noire XO?\n\nThanks! :)\n\ne; I also don't live anywhere near a place to test each.",

    "selftext": "I didn't expect much from Myer Audio, and I didn't really follow their work. The CKLVX D62 model is still popular, although it gets a lot more attention than it really deserves, I think; the SL41 MK2 one was excellent, but the next few models didn't seem to stand out in the stream of endless Chinese specialties.\n\nTherefore, I approached the next model, SLIIVO SL224, with minimum expectations. My loss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij95o9whopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2c35707a8bb0ad7bea5154dacf5740c96e62d49\n\nToday, we'll talk about SLIIVO SL224, in-ear headphones priced at $285 (as of October 2025).\n\n# All but the sound\n\nThe earphones are delivered in a cardboard box, normal-sized for the earphones of this price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46te32ckopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaf049b747a3e2612525251c1f342557f1e6e261\n\nIn the box, we can find the earphones themselves, a round leather case, 7 pairs of eartips, and a cable with replaceable connectors. No surprises.\n\nThe cable is beautiful, nice, with a resistance of 0.3 Ohms. The connectors are inserted and fixed to the cable with coarse-threaded nuts. This approach feels reliable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yq7y8nlopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e39369d65e608cae16450636cf618925bd366a2c\n\nIn addition to the 3.5 and 4.4 mm connectors, a Type-C connector was also included, which, of course, is not a connector at all, but a DAC. The DAC works exclusively in 16-bit/48 kHz mode, in Plug'n'play mode, with standard drivers in Windows 11, if nothing else. There are no special drivers on the [manufacturer's website](https://myeraudio.com/) (however, the website looks like it's being barely maintained, to put it mildly). The Walk Play app doesn't see it. But thanks for including it anyway.\n\nThere are 3 pairs of slightly tighter silicone eartips of a standard shape, sizes S, M and L...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xtkizhnopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1d969d57be38137156ba8de6bb85674f71f3ff\n\n...3 more pairs of slightly softer silicone eartips...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w63t0snoopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20fc14caa0167803e16403be6c068333bf719521\n\n...as well as 1 pair of foam ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy6v1cxpopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cca6a13136ec2ef430ce9374cb05ea4469a0a812\n\nThe earphones themselves are technically made on the basis of a menagerie of 2 dynamic (6 and 10 mm), 2 armature and 4 microplanar drivers, or a total of 8 drivers in each earphone. Each of the driver types plays back lower, middle, and upper frequencies, respectively.\n\nThe earphones' enclosures are made of polymer resin and have a pronounced relief, that is, ergonomic depressions and projections.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfydif6ropxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0e22a05e4a02671e7249bbe0040085de8fcb5d1\n\nThe earphones are designed for an average depth of the fit and have standard diameters of sound ducts by modern standards, so you can experiment with eartips at great length and with abandon: SpinFit CP100+, Pentaconn COREIR, Roseselsa SoundCocoon, Divinus Prism Wide Bore ‚Äì [they all](https://boizoff.com/eartips_part_4/) fit and let you comfortably place the earphones in your ears. I never managed to settle on anything specific, as they all are fine.\n\nI can't say anything bad about SL224 in terms of user experience and ergonomics ‚Äì they're just well-made modern in-ear headphones without any pitfalls. Of course, their black polished plastic surface scratches quickly and collects fingerprints, but that's how 99% of all headphones are made now, so there's nothing we can do. I can also complain about the case: for the earphones of this size and the cable of this length and thickness, this case is frankly small. Give me a bigger one now!\n\nAs for the electrical characteristics, the manufacturer claims a resistance of 36 Œ© and a sensitivity of 108 dB. I can't comment on the second value, but I've recently become able to measure resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vktmk7topxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0087afee237e878d735e0bae6214e181dd579035\n\nIt varies from 34 to 14 Œ©.\n\n# The sound\n\n*Standard links:*\n\n1. *the description of my rig is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/renovation-of-my-measuring-rig-for-headphones/)*;*\n2. *the audiogram of my hearing is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/audiogram/)*;*\n3. *articles on measurement theory and the whole shebang are* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/category/audiophile/theory/)*.*\n\nFrequency response of SLIIVO SL224 earphones with original foam eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hfl2191ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cea47660d534a586276350a062dc957e1a569d4\n\nAnd, before analyzing the frequency response, let me remind you that this frequency response will strongly depend on the depth of the fit. Frequency response of SL224 for the second resonance at 7000, 7500, 8000 and 8500 Hz:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lbyhjm2ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb404456030ce4a4c3f442905acc9d1c7a41284\n\nNote that there is no simple displacement of the resonant peak. On the contrary, the entire range from 3 to 20 kHz changes significantly, and only the emphasis at 12 kHz remains more or less stable in terms of volume and 'width', so to speak. The key thing that can be seen from these graphs is that the deeper the earphones are placed in the auditory canals, the lower the area before the second resonance 'droops' and the higher the peak rises around 15 kHz.\n\nComparison of frequency response for original foam and silicone eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg8uwbu4ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c2be14aaa3c3c99ba0cf535c6d00c6b7b3175bc\n\nAnyway, we can see the following on the graphs:\n\n* it seems to be a more or less typical sound delivery a la Harman;\n* but with reduced subbass;\n* and with a 'muffled', but rather 'smooth' 4-10 kHz segment;\n* as well as with an expansion after 10 kHz, the nature of which depends on the eartips. The graph obtained when using silicone eartips is more valid for my ears.\n\nBesides, consider a slight rise in the bass, about 250 Hz, as well as the shape of the 600 Hz to 3 kHz segment ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost linear. We'll talk below how this affects the SL224 sound perception.\n\nNonlinear distortion at 94 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g2c9x48ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=031fd6a69ca193c02a48b3996e51ed689a3e213e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrc4ao19ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3afce27b77c8e94f80bfa77f522bdc0e82f1eec\n\nNonlinear distortion at 104 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_1.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_1.jpg)\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_2.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_2.jpg)\n\nThere's not much to comment on here: at 94 dB, the distortion is just over 0.5% at the maximum; at 104 dB volume, it's over 1%. That is, they have no audible effect on the sound.\n\nMinimum phase response, group delay, and spectrogram in the 'Burst decay' mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kxxdhfdppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbabddd9448e7feaa7bfba5bd9e255749fba11db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfq42o6eppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=258891b29d856b4a4102a1ee88176893e93ffc2b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jadpkhseppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e62b9f7e963ddeb411d1c3629b85179cc9f17a3\n\nIt's a common near-ideal pattern, typical for all modern in-ears of a similar price.\n\nMy subjective evaluation is that I'm blown away primarily by how full-fledged the SL224 sound delivery turned out to be. And I deliberately don't use the word 'balanced' because it refers to the concept of neutrality. Literally everything in the sound of these earphones is in place. All frequencies are exactly in the amount that my ear personally expects. There is a very, very weighty, but technical subbass, a 'close' articulated middle with a hearing-friendly range at about 6-8 kHz, and an airy lightness after 10 kHz. It's very difficult to describe this sound because it's 'correct' and 'tasty' at the same time. In other words, you definitely won't be able to complain about tonal inaccuracy as it's at a very high level, but you also have this feeling of a 'spectacular' sound. It's difficult for me to clearly connect this with measurement graphs, but I assume that it's the linear range of 600-3000 Hz (and here we can move on to an endless debate about how to correctly combine frequency response graphs for comparison), as well as some emphasis on ultra-high frequencies that speak for themselves.\n\nA standalone interesting quality of these earphones, which I really appreciate and which is relatively rare, is the instrument sound separation. It's just splendid. You can listen to each vocal line, percussion, each component of the track separately and distinguish its perception from the overall musical flow.\n\nMoreover, the width of the sound stage is clearly larger than average. SL224 play in a large-scale, airy manner, and the recording space noticeably lives and breathes. The music plays 'around your head' and even more or less from behind rather than between your ears.\n\nAs one would expect with such sound delivery, these earphones are very versatile in terms of suitable musical content. The only limitation, apart from your taste, is the quality of tracks. If a sound engineer has been careful about recording and processing of the high frequency area, everything will be fine. If they haven't, you will be hearing weird and unpleasant things.\n\n# Comparisons\n\nIf we compare within the price category, guided by the [best online rating of in-ear monitors](https://boizoff.com/language/en/the-best-iems/), then the following models will be next to SL224:\n\n* PULA ANVIL 114\n* Letshuoer Cadenza 4\n* Kiwi Ears Orchestra Lite.\n\nI have compared them, of course, up-close and personal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1p7xn3ippxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0934c4bb516dc35126dc0ced23e9d82aefefd3ec\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to ANVIL 114: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_ANVIL114.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_ANVIL114.png)\n\nWhen A/B-ing, ANVIL 114 fully justify their name, hitting the listener's ears with a steel hammer: this is a massive, 'fat' sound supported by a bone conduction driver against the rather neutral, 'elegant' SL224 sound delivery.\n\n\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Cadenza 4: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Cadenza\\_4.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Cadenza_4.png)\n\nCadenza 4 are an example of excellent 'light' headphones. Compared to SL224, they have more 'top' and less 'bottom' in almost identical proportions. The Cadenza 4's sound delivery is 'airier', lighter, 'sparklier', and they have a slightly smoother section after 10 kHz, while SL224, again, are more neutral and, therefore, more versatile in comparison.\n\n\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Orchestra Lite: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Orchestra\\_Lite.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Orchestra_Lite.png)\n\nWe love Orchestra Lite for their infinitely expressive 'middle'. It seems that Orchestra Lite deliver sound even 'closer' to the listener, and they're a little brighter if we evaluate the sound delivery by and large, but SL224 win in terms of reliability and 'punch'.\n\n\n\nIf we look at the SL224 tuning conceptually, so to speak, then we need to compare them with completely different earphones ‚Äì [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/) and [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o78vvvipppxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ca90c5ee84b8406929c106d0d5555ef26ddc5b\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Meteor: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Meteor.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Meteor.png)\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Mega5-EST: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Mega5-EST.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Mega5-EST.png)\n\nAll three graphs compared:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mna3exppxf1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65aac9b4a17b9c969bac7fa6de31bcb38d5dc526\n\nCompared to Meteor, SL224 have a weightier bass and subbass due to a less pronounced middle; the Meteor sound seems sterile and faded against SL224. And, compared to Mega5-EST SL224, on the contrary, they're slightly less bassy, and the midrange is more pronounced. By ear, the SL224's sound delivery is almost perfectly equidistant from the tunings of these two models. The only thing that SL224 don't have is a smooth (by ear) frequency response after 10 kHz, which competitors can boast of. SL224 deliver this segment clearer, but less accurate. But prices vary accordingly, too.\n\nThe only aspect where I can name the best option for less money is gaming: from a positioning point of view, [KBEAR Cepheus](https://boizoff.com/language/en/kbear-cepheus-earphones-review/) remain unattainable and subjectively the best headphones for competitive games. But SL224 are also quite good in this context, don't get me wrong.\n\n# Summary\n\nI believe that the SL224's entry into the market is a significant milestone in the modern headphone industry. The SL224 is as iconic a model as [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/), [EPZ K9](https://boizoff.com/language/en/epz-k9-earphones-review/) or [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/) in their categories.\n\nAs for the sound‚Ä¶ I'm willing to pay to see the first reaction to the SL224 sound of someone for whom these earphones will be the first or second under the sun, as the wow effect from their first listening is so intense, and they differ so much from 'just headphones' and any TWS. SL224 are tuned just superbly: their sound delivery is simultaneously engaging, especially if you turn up the volume, but also reliable and large-scale in the sense of a virtual sound stage.\n\nWho won't like them? 'Bassheads' and fans of listening to music in the conditions of high ambient noise, that is, on the streets of a big city (noise masking will reduce the sound of these headphones to medium and high frequencies only).\n\nTo buy or not to buy? To buy!  \n",

However, I am experiencing some extremely harsh, sharp and painful kind of sibilance to some vocals on some tracks. For example from 1:43-1:55 on Duckworth by Kendrick Lamar. This happens mostly on s-sounds.\n\nI found that I had to meticulously EQ around 9800 Hz (q factor of 3), reducing it by around 6-7 dB in order to get rid of this painful sound. However, I find that doing this makes the overall sound more dull, dark and less defined. I'm not sure what to do. Measurement of the AR5000's frequency response shows a big peak at around 9500 Hz, could this perhaps be why? I did not see Resolve mention this problem in his review of the headphones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/undw3zt1kpxf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c527c80ede8fe7708253b26ec1c84e2adf4e1f8\n\nI have a pair of airpods pro 2 that i have no problems with.

Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be ¬£3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by Edifier or have any commercial interests in selling headphones. I just like music and love a good deal.\n\nThe Edifier WH950NB likely need no introduction; they launched for ‚Ç¨150 in Europe two years ago, have been around ‚Ç¨110 for a long time, and the white model has dipped to ‚Ç¨71 for a week a few months ago. I bought them on launch, and waited for a long time to form my opinion.\n\nI commute a few hours with them daily, and charge them once a week. I'm coming from a Hifiman Deva Pro, Sennheiser HD58X, and HD560S. I cannot overstate it: these headphones are phenomenal. Not \"good enough for Bluetooth headphones\", no, I often use them as my preferred listening experience over the others.\n\nHere's the secret: you get a (somewhat restricted) parametric EQ in the Edifier app. However, I created a preset from data (and my ears) that sounds so, so much better than the default tuning (see attached image for graphs):\n\n39Hz -3dB 2.0 (Optional)\n\n3000Hz -8dB 2.0\n\n3300Hz 3dB 2.0\n\n9000Hz 3dB 0.5\n\nIf you use UAPP on Android you can do automatic sample rate switching so you bypass Android's resampler on LDAC, and with some extra parametric EQ bands in UAPP you can improve the sound signature slightly more (I can add my preset in a comment if anyone is interested).\n\nOther than sound signature, these do everything you'd expect from a modern pair of BT headphones. There's passive and active 3.5mm support, a massive two-week battery, multiple ANC modes, multi-point Bluetooth 5.3, 96/32 LDAC, safe volume limiter, low latency mode, theater surround sound mode, and most importantly, an amazing travel case with a bunch of accessoires included (airplane splitter, usb-c cable, 3.5mm L-shape cable, protection pad for the folded cup).\n\nGenuinely wondering how no one is talking about these. Some of my family members, friends and colleagues bought one on my recommendation and they all think it's an amazing product. I only hear about the ‚Ç¨300+ products from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser etc.\n\nIs there anyone else that has these?\n\nEdit: Formatting",

    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it‚Äôs tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For ‚Äúheavier‚Äù music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that‚Äôs clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It‚Äôs an excellent headphone and if you don‚Äôt AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

Regardless of what experts, reviews or anyone what is saying: what is your perfect pair of headphones? \n\nI used to have a pair of first generation Sennheiser Momentum but then due to working from home and getting a Jabra Evolve 75 SE from my company for calls I stopped using them and somehow lost them. \n\nRecently there came a point, though, where I got sick and tired from listening to music on them. I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring. At that moment I realised that they are perfect for me.",

But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment.

Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can‚Äôt imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these. They‚Äôre far from neutral but if you like the way they color music Grados are some of the best cans. After 15+ years of experience with their headphones I feel like I have ‚Äúarrived‚Äù with these and my modest budget audiophile set up. \n\nThe HiFimans are a delight as well. Far more neutral, but man can they be EQed. No distortion with any level of reasonable EQ on the bass so if I want to put on some electronic music and blast some chunky thick bass directly into my brain, these are the cans to do it. While I definitely use the Grados more, these are an amazing second set to have at my desk for when I listen to music that the Grados aren‚Äôt well suited for. (Not that other music sounds /bad/ on them, it‚Äôs just not what they excel at.)\n\nNone of my friends are big into audio and they‚Äôve heard me rant about my cans probably more times they can count so I thought I‚Äôd dump my thoughts and adoration of my set up here. \n\nFeel free to share your desktop set up‚Äôs as well I‚Äôd love to see what other people are working with, gear-wise. \n",

Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones.

    "selftext": "\nThe Hifiman Arya stealth are absurdly good for the price I got them at. At just below 500 dollars it‚Äôs the Ultimate endgame headphone for me. \n\nThe comfort is very nice. The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it‚Äôs Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth‚Äôs do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it‚Äôs a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it‚Äôs very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn‚Äôt too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren‚Äôt for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can‚Äôt wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now. Maybe later in life I‚Äôll upgrade but I know diminishing returns hit really hard after this so it‚Äôs a matter until I have some cash ready to burn. \n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Lets talk about the new Edition XV",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/it1hxzzqlrxf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=5912a58e06d71ad339cda4f905209e4b1052edb0\n\nI compared a few headphones a couple of days ago, and a lot of people wanted to hear more about the Edition XV. So let‚Äôs talk about it.\n\nAmong all the headphones I‚Äôve listened to, the closest one might be the Fiio FT1 Pro. The moment I put the Edition XV on, I instantly felt this warmth spreading through me ‚Äî like being wrapped in honey. You‚Äôll know what I mean once you try it.\n\n**Bass (before & after eq using oratory 1990's, the EQ didn't change the conclusion below)**\n\nThe most distinctive thing about the Edition XV, to my ears, is its **meaty bass**. It‚Äôs thick, elastic, and feels like it‚Äôs hugging the sides of your ears. It‚Äôs not the fast, clean kind of bass you get from the HE600. It‚Äôs the wet, creamy kind ‚Äî like your ears are being gently massaged with a cloth soaked in oil.\n\nThe bass also has more layers than the FT1 Pro, but the FT1 Pro‚Äôs bass FEELS more aggressive. It‚Äôs like a scholar delivering an insult ‚Äî refined, yet every word cuts deep. There‚Äôs more nuance and subtlety here, unlike the FT1 Pro, which just lashes out bluntly. Naturally, this makes the Edition XV sound a bit less aggressive at first. But if you listen closely, the impact is still there ‚Äî it just feels smoother and more full-bodied.\n\nThat said, not everyone listens critically all the time. When I‚Äôm just relaxing, I sometimes *feel* like the FT1 Pro has more bass (even though that‚Äôs not actually true if you listen critically when A/B them). I just want to bring this up because sometimes people would only describe stuff in their critical listening sessions, but headphones could feel VERY¬† different in daily casual listening.\n\n**Mids**\n\nNow, the mids. Vocals on the Edition XV are closer and more intimate than typical Hifiman models like the Arya Stealth or Edition XS, but still a bit farther away than on the FT1 Pro. The voice is rich, full, and slightly nasal. For female vocals, the singer can sound about ten years older than she actually is. That‚Äôs not necessarily good or bad ‚Äî it‚Äôs all down to taste.\n\nThe vocals lean on the darker side. Compared to the FT1 Pro, they‚Äôre more refined but also smoother ‚Äî which means you lose some of that raw texture in the voice, like the growls in the rock music. Personally, I prefer the FT1 Pro‚Äôs vocal texture; it carries more emotion like anger or passion. The Arya Stealth also feels more emotional than the Edition XV, but for a different reason ‚Äî it has more treble, more air, and that shimmer in the highs makes the vocals feel alive and vibrant. (You know those highs that vibrate with your skulls?)\n\nStill, the Edition XV has its own charm. A lot of 80s and 90s tracks ‚Äî songs like city pop ‚Äî take on a totally different vibe here. In fact, I‚Äôd describe the Edition XV as a **vibe** in itself. You know those days when you‚Äôre tired of all the crap and just want to chill, wrapped in a soft blanket, hugging a pillow? That‚Äôs what the Edition XV feels like. It won‚Äôt shock you, it won‚Äôt thrill you ‚Äî it just gives you that warm, steady, safe harbor you want to come home to.\n\n**Treble**\n\nThe treble is soft ‚Äî no sibilance, no sting. The FT1 Pro is more exciting in this area, which is why I think it‚Äôs the better all-rounder. The Edition XV, though, owns its signature mood completely.\n\n**Others**\n\nAs for soundstage ‚Äî the Edition XV‚Äôs lateral stage is narrower than its front-to-back depth. Sometimes the sound on both sides feels smeared onto a flat plane beside your ears, kind of vibrating there, which feels a bit unnatural. The FT1 Pro‚Äôs stage is even smaller, but it doesn‚Äôt have that issue.\n\nOverall, the Edition XV definitely has better detail retrieval and imaging than the FT1 Pro.\n\n**I wouldn't use a \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this headphone, since it is so special in the Hifiman lineup that I don't think there is any other hifiman headphone that can be compared with it. It is its own vibe, and if you can vibe with it, then it can probably beat those far more expensive headphones for you. If you can't (for example, you really enjoy other Hifiman lineups), it's really hard to say if you would enjoy it as much as others do.**\n\nHere is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1odsod7/comparison_between_he600_edition_xv_edition_xs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from a couple of days ago if you want to know more about my preference in sounds.",

    "selftext": "These have supplanted the Sennheiser HD6xx as my favorite open back and the one I use daily. The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else. I would be perfectly happy with these as my open back and Aeon Closed RT as my closed back for the forseeable future.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

I mean thats what the graph shows - much higher attentuation dBs for the APP3s compared to the XM5s. They do fizzle out near the high pitched end but im guessing that overears even without ANC are better in blocking out high freq noise because of the build material and clamping over ears. Seems like ANC doesnt make much of a difference for XM5s anyways on the high end. So my question is that ive seen all over the internet that overears + anc are always better than wireless earbuds (air pods). Why is this case different? Or am i a total idiot and i dont understand the graphs or the context. ",

    "selftext": "**Hello community!**\n\nHere I am again, writing another review, with my music playing and my extra long black coffee nice and hot, and, although I already had all my ideas organized in my head, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to give another listen to the model I present today: **Kefine Delci AE**, released in 2024.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present **my sources:**\n\n\\-FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.  \n\\-FiiO KA13 while working.  \n\\-FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.  \n\\-FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.  \n\\-FiiO KA11.  \n\\-FiiO JA11.  \n\\-Macbook Air M4 3.5mm output.  \n\\-Shanling M0 Pro. **NEW!!**  \n\\-Amazon Music Ultimate.  \n\\-Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons:**\n\n\\-Pros  \n\\>The most comfortable set I‚Äôve ever tried.  \n\\>Works very well with any source.  \n\\>Very wide soundstage in all three axes.  \n\\>Solid, fun, precise sub-bass and bass.  \n\\>Clear, present, and layered mids.\n\n\\-Cons:  \n\\>Cable connections are not interchangeable.  \n\\>The gold filter makes the high frequencies aggressive.  \n\\>Treble a little compressed.  \n\\>The cable slider doesn‚Äôt stay fixed.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis set of monitors was provided by the brand **Kefine** and **Mr. Yang**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.\n\nThe price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65‚Ç¨**.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn‚Äôt have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.\n\nMy surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle‚Ä¶ but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.\n\n\n\n**Will they meet my tastes?**\n\nFirst, let‚Äôs look at the **package contents:**\n\n\\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  \n\\-User **manual**.  \n\\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  \n\\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  \n\\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  \n\\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  \n\\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.\n\n\n\n**They look comfortable, right?**\n\nThis is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.\n\nThe answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn‚Äôt have started better.\n\nThe capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone‚Äôs auricle and ear canal.\n\nFor this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.\n\nThe cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn‚Äôt tangle, and doesn‚Äôt pull by catching on your clothing.\n\nI don‚Äôt know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.\n\nWhat I didn‚Äôt find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn‚Äôt fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.\n\n\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n\\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  \n\\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  \n\\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  \n\\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz\n\nThe **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.\n\nI would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.\n\n\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nThese **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.\n\nMy experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.\n\nI could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone‚Äôs intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.\n\nHowever, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.\n\n*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn‚Äôt the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.\n\n*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn‚Äôt interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.\n\n*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.\n\n*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don‚Äôt feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.\n\n*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.\n\n*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don‚Äôt need more, nor do I want it.\n\n*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors‚Äô tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.\n\n*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.\n\n*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.\n\n**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.\n\nRegarding **layering**: I don‚Äôt know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can‚Äôt believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.\n\n\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.\n\nI encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\nThe source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.\n\nIn the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.\n\nIn *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.\n\nRegarding Kratos‚Äô very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.\n\nIn the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn‚Äôt the highest resolution experience I‚Äôve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.\n\nThe child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.\n\nContinuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it‚Äôs the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*\n\nWell, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.\n\nNevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn‚Äôt the best for purists since listening wasn‚Äôt fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.\n\n\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI don‚Äôt want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I‚Äôve tested. At least up to the **100‚Ç¨/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what‚Äôs the point of spending more money?\n\nI acknowledge it isn‚Äôt perfect. In fact, technically, it‚Äôs inferior to two other competitors in its price range I‚Äôve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I‚Äôm not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.\n\nThey have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn‚Äôt hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.\n\nMy sincerest congratulations to the brand.\n\nThank you for reading if you‚Äôve made it this far.\n\n**See you in the next review.**\n\n**Greetings!**",

My Steam Deck suddenly stopped working last night.\n\n\n\n# The Problem:\n\n\n\nI was playing a game (*The Walking Dead*), put the Deck into **Sleep Mode**, and when I tried to wake it up, the screen remained black and it wouldn't boot.\n\n\n\n# Chronological Order\n\n\n\n1. **Initial State:** When pressing the power button, the screen remained black, and the **white power LED would flash exactly 3 times** before turning off completely. I tried this multiple times.\n2. **Troubleshooting Attempts:** I followed all standard troubleshooting steps:\n   * Hard reset (holding the power button for 15 seconds).\n   * Attempting to enter the BIOS/Boot Manager (Volume Up + Power).\n3. **Current State (Critical Failure):** After these attempts, the Deck is now **completely unresponsive**.\n   * Pressing the power button does nothing.\n   * **Crucially, when I connect the original charger, the LED next to the USB-C port does NOT light up.** It is not accepting a charge.\n\n\n\n# Context \n\nI understand this is a critical hardware failure (likely the battery circuit or motherboard), but I have a concern regarding support. **I bought the Deck second-hand a few months ago, and it has worked flawlessly until now.**\n\n**My questions for the community are:**\n\n1. Has anyone experienced the exact sequence of the **3 white LED flashes** followed by the Deck completely dying (no power/no charging LED)?\n2. What was your experience with Valve support for a critical hardware failure? Did they require the original proof of purchase (even if the serial number is still under warranty)?\n\nI have already prepared a support ticket for Valve, but any personal experience or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

    "title": "Fallout 4 VR kinda works on steam deck",
    "selftext": "Okay, so my last post I described how SkyrimVR works really well on the deck. Well I promised you all that I was going to test Fallout 4 VR on the deck. Here are my results. It‚Äôs more work than SkyrimVR and requires more setup.\n\nSo initially it ran like absolute garbage. Barely playable, maybe if i had no other way of playing it, I could put up with it, but I have strong VR Legs. Performance is abysmal and casual players will suffer with it. Begin by lowering all the settings within the performance menu of Fallout 4 VR. \n\nTurn off anti aliasing, shadow distance to low and everything else as low as possible. This will make performance somewhat tolerable. Next step is your resolution settings which are by far the most important when considering performance/FPS of the game.\nYou don‚Äôt change this in the ini file but in steamVR itself. So I have a quest 1. The resolution is about 1400x1600 natively. \n\nSo I set mine to slightly below that. This gives a massive increase to performance. If you don‚Äôt mind pixelation then you can easily achieve playable FPS by going to your steamVR settings and changing it to as low as you can. Obviously most people will struggle though as it can become pretty blurry at that point. \n\nI don‚Äôt think this is the end though. \nYou can install mods manually by extracting them to the game directory. So I installed insignificant object remover and then added it to the plugins file manually.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of work so here is what I did.\n\nI browsed to the fallout 4 VR Install directory which is where the ini files are installed and manually added those mod files to the plugins.txt file.\n\nI know from windows it is usually located in the ‚Äúappdata/fallout 4‚Äù \nIt didn‚Äôt exist for me so I created the plugins.txt file and added the file name of the mod I had extracted manually.\n\nSo copy the name of the ESP file and add a star in front of it. So * then name of installed mod file. Each file name should be one line then press enter if you wish to add another mod underneath. You need to add each mod to a separate line. \n\nUsually on a normal modded fallout 4 install this is done automatically by the mod menu or mod manager in game. Since we are working outside the bounds we will have to do this manually. \nOnce that is done launch the game.\n\nI changed my resolution to 20% as I have a quest 1 and it ran. \n\nPersonally my FPS wasn‚Äôt too good. It was pixelated and felt horrid. Even as a person with strong VR legs it was hard to stomach. \nThis is my first attempt though and I have no doubt that if I installed FPS Mods correctly and tweaked the ini settings I can get this game stable. \n\nNow judging from my experience in flat Fallout 4 modding on low spec systems, I know that you can lower texture resolutions for huge performance increases. There are multiple mods on the nexus to achieve this result but unfortunately I didn‚Äôt test this out.\n\nI 100% know that if I was to install lower resolution mods, disable shadows and other effects I could achieve a high FPS but I didn‚Äôt go that far (yet), but I know it‚Äôs possible. \n\nTLDR: it‚Äôs completely possible to run fallout 4 VR on the steam deck. There are many guides on setting up vortex on steam deck and if you can do that you can achieve playable frame rates. I haven‚Äôt set it up personally (not yet anyway)\n\nSo many naysayers are going to tell you how fallout 4 VR will never perform playable on the DECK. This is bullshit.\nPeople like to talk about things they haven‚Äôt tried. I‚Äôve tested this game and I think if you put enough effort in you can get it playable.\n\nPersonally I could play it with vanilla settings even with the lower FPS. But I know from my experience with modding flat Fallout 4 that with ini tweaks and downgrading the texture resolution and draw distances, this game can be made completely VR capable the deck. The great thing about the creation/gamebyro engine is it is versatile.\n\nI will make a new thread soon when I get it running better. If you are like me and have no other way of experiencing fallout 4 VR (with only a steam deck) then I suggest you hang tight as this is a solvable issue.\n\nI haven‚Äôt even touched upon the GPD Win sized texture pack, the downgraded ini files or the load acceleration mods.\n\nIt is possible but for now, we are at the first step. \n\n",

I'll mainly code and study for the car license.\n\nMy other option is to get a cheap laptop, one second hand shop near my has a cheap laptop for 99‚Ç¨ . \n\nIdk whether I should get a laptop or a portable monitor.\n\nAs I said, I'll just use it for code, browese the web and light tasks, nothing that needs strong hardware.\n\nTake into consideration I'll probably move back to home by plane on December.\n\nThanks! \n\nEdit: I have mouse and keyboard, forgot to mention that.",

It stays like that for like 1-2 minutes and then it comes back to normal. \n\nSo I can understand it does that because of the temperature, but it would make sense for the fan to keep going as normal, but it doesn't, it slows down.\n\nIs it normal behavior? Or could it be a malfunction?\n\nWhat I do nowadays is that I limit the TDP to all games, I tend to max it to 10 TDP on high end games, which is where the SD doesn't get that hot so I don't suffer this problem.",

I‚Äôve had my LCD 512GB Deck for about three years now (I upgraded the SSD to 2TB over a year ago, I don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with my issues)\n\nBasically, the Deck is constantly freezing and locking up mid-game lately. Sometimes the system will fully reboot itself when I‚Äôm in the middle of a game, sometimes it‚Äôll simply freeze with the game hanging and none of the controls responding, forcing me to hold the power button to to force it off. Occasionally when this happens I also get the audio glitching and repeating, sort of like when you‚Äôd accidentally knock a CD player back in the day.\n\nI‚Äôve had my performance metrics on lately to see if there is any kind of overheating happening but it doesn‚Äôt appear so. Lately I‚Äôve been playing Hades 2 and Megabonk, both of which have frozen and crashed the Deck multiple times but I wouldn‚Äôt consider them hyper taxing games. I‚Äôve also had this issue while emulating old games.\n\nFrom Googling around for solutions I have tried switching from the Beta OS channel to the Stable, and back again. It hasn‚Äôt made any difference. Seems like the only other recommended option I‚Äôve seen online is doing a factory reset, which I would hate to do but if that‚Äôs what it takes, I‚Äôll do it. I have Decky installed and Cryoutilities. I‚Äôve had both for years. \n\nWondering if anyone here has any ideas. Thank you!\n",

    "selftext": "So I previously had a dual boot setup with windows but after it wiped my SteamOS partition during an update, it got wiped itself. Windows is not a viable way to play games unless you tinker and completely disable updates. SteamOS can do 95 percent of things except anti cheat. \n\nAnyway\nSo my previous thread I ran Fallout New Vegas through vorpx on windows and it ran pretty well but after wiping windows I still had the VR itch. \n\nSo I found ALVR works under steam OS so I thought I‚Äôd give it a test, and to my surprise it worked really well with almost no advanced tinkering. \n\nI went to desktop, installed ALVR then SteamVR. Installed the Firewall rules and still had ALVR on my quest 1. \nTried aircarVR as a test and got amazingly smooth performance, much better than I got under Windows, so I got adventurous and tried Skyrim VR.\n\nNow I‚Äôd previously tried to run SkyrimVR under windows and it simply would not work. It would CTD on launch and never worked. I read up some people had got it working but the amount of work was just ridiculous and not worth it. Everyone kept claiming the performance will be awful and unplayable. Well I‚Äôm here to quash that myth. It works amazingly well without mods and completely vanilla. A great start if you just want to play it as is. \n\nIt started up right away, no crashes and straight into the starting room. I loaded my save at whiterun and it performed great. I had a bit of slow down when loading in but other than that, smooth as butter. If you‚Äôre looking for a vanilla experience, I can say it works perfectly. I didn‚Äôt even change the performance preset from medium. If you encounter slowdown, then bumping that down would make it even better.\nIt looked a bit blurry but still completely playable, the blur can be fixed with mods and settings tweaks anyway but I didn‚Äôt do it. \n\nSo if you want to play Skyrim VR, it works on the deck. \nSome quick pointers to finish, \n\nIf you get a black screen with ALVR then you need to add the launch command on the GitHub. You need to add it to run ALVR no exceptions. \n\nMake sure you don‚Äôt suffocate your deck when you VR game, you‚Äôll end up with bad performance throttling and a melted console. Keep it ventilated and performance will remain stable. \n\nI lowered my resolution to match my Quest 1 within steamVR, so if you get performance issues, try lowering yours.\n\nI tried running ALVR in gaming mode but it had a black screen, I didn‚Äôt tinker further but that might be fixable. For now keep the deck in desktop mode for VR\n\nDon‚Äôt bother with windows for just VR. It‚Äôs more hassle than just using SteamOS. I originally dual booted for VR thinking that it would be harder to set up on Linux, I was wrong. SteamVR on Linux works fine. \n\nMy next test will be Fallout 4 VR. I‚Äôve heard the performance from other people‚Äôs tests is not good. It is a bit more demanding than Skyrim. I feel I can fix that with mods though and ini tweaks. It didn‚Äôt launch under windows though, it CTD. So let‚Äôs hope it runs as well and as easy as Skyrim did.\n\nWish me luck ",

It starts around 40 FPS but drops all the way down to 3 FPS every 10 seconds or so.\n\nI thought maybe it was just Cyberpunk, so I tried Monster Hunter Rise and Hades, exact same thing happens there.\n\nI already tried the battery storage mode but didn't work. \n\nHas anyone seen something like this before or know what might be causing it or do you notice something weird on the performance layer, please let me know.

That's fine. Problem is that in order to trigger them, I'd have to boot up steam link or moonlight, start and end of every session, run them from the app list, close.\n\nWhat I'd ideally like is to have these two nestled away in my 'Game Streaming'  category, so they're just 2-3 taps away, and .sh files don't get bumped to the top of the home menu when used.",

This makes it really hard to enjoy that type of game and I essentially feel like I'm missing out by playing something like Indiana Jones on my deck instead of my 27\" 1440P monitor which is much more immersive.\n\nAt the same time, I find myself wanting to play more on the SD because after working 8 hours from home on my computer, sitting there and gaming another 4+ is getting old and it's affecting me because it becomes a room of depression if that makes sense. When I play cartoon games, 2d, platformers, etc. on deck it feels great and I wish I was able to game on the couch or even in bed where I have more windows/light, etc. just makes it feel better after spending all day working in a small dark room.\n\nAnyone else experience the same and find any solutions?",

    "title": "Did the Steam Deck kill my SD card?",
    "selftext": "I've looked around and can't find a specific answer to this, but some bits of info that point to my Steam Deck damaging my 1.5tb Sandisk SD card. \n\n  \nSD card worked fine for a few months and then recently games just wouldn't load from the SD card. I had to reinstall them to get them working, which they did but the install took a while so I decided to reformat the SD card to get it working correctly. The formatting just didn't work, just sat there. Tried a few methods mentioned on some posts about formatting but wouldn't work. Formatted the card on my PC - quick format works find but full format again just doesnt do anything - sitting at 0% after 30 minutes. According to my PC the card is fine, no errors. After a quick format I used it on my PC and am installing Steam Games on there as it seems more reliable than the Steam Deck - but its taking a very long time to install - for context its taken over an hour to do 10gb of a 40gb install, where as installing on a different disk took about 10 mins for 10gb. \n\n  \nI know this is a crossover into general tech support, but I've seen a few people mention SD card problems so wondering it might be an issues with the Steam Deck and if there anyway to fix the card?\n\n  \nThanks",

    "title": "Fallout 4 VR kinda works on steam deck",
    "selftext": "Okay, so my last post I described how SkyrimVR works really well on the deck. Well I promised you all that I was going to test Fallout 4 VR on the deck. Here are my results. It‚Äôs more work than SkyrimVR and requires more setup.\n\nSo initially it ran like absolute garbage. Barely playable, maybe if i had no other way of playing it, I could put up with it, but I have strong VR Legs. Performance is abysmal and casual players will suffer with it. Begin by lowering all the settings within the performance menu of Fallout 4 VR. \n\nTurn off anti aliasing, shadow distance to low and everything else as low as possible. This will make performance somewhat tolerable. Next step is your resolution settings which are by far the most important when considering performance/FPS of the game.\nYou don‚Äôt change this in the ini file but in steamVR itself. So I have a quest 1. The resolution is about 1400x1600 natively. \n\nSo I set mine to slightly below that. This gives a massive increase to performance. If you don‚Äôt mind pixelation then you can easily achieve playable FPS by going to your steamVR settings and changing it to as low as you can. Obviously most people will struggle though as it can become pretty blurry at that point. \n\nI don‚Äôt think this is the end though. \nYou can install mods manually by extracting them to the game directory. So I installed insignificant object remover and then added it to the plugins file manually.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of work so here is what I did.\n\nI browsed to the fallout 4 VR Install directory which is where the ini files are installed and manually added those mod files to the plugins.txt file.\n\nI know from windows it is usually located in the ‚Äúappdata/fallout 4‚Äù \nIt didn‚Äôt exist for me so I created the plugins.txt file and added the file name of the mod I had extracted manually.\n\nSo copy the name of the ESP file and add a star in front of it. So * then name of installed mod file. Each file name should be one line then press enter if you wish to add another mod underneath. You need to add each mod to a separate line. \n\nUsually on a normal modded fallout 4 install this is done automatically by the mod menu or mod manager in game. Since we are working outside the bounds we will have to do this manually. \nOnce that is done launch the game.\n\nI changed my resolution to 20% as I have a quest 1 and it ran. \n\nPersonally my FPS wasn‚Äôt too good. It was pixelated and felt horrid. Even as a person with strong VR legs it was hard to stomach. \nThis is my first attempt though and I have no doubt that if I installed FPS Mods correctly and tweaked the ini settings I can get this game stable. \n\nNow judging from my experience in flat Fallout 4 modding on low spec systems, I know that you can lower texture resolutions for huge performance increases. There are multiple mods on the nexus to achieve this result but unfortunately I didn‚Äôt test this out.\n\nI 100% know that if I was to install lower resolution mods, disable shadows and other effects I could achieve a high FPS but I didn‚Äôt go that far (yet), but I know it‚Äôs possible. \n\nTLDR: it‚Äôs completely possible to run fallout 4 VR on the steam deck. There are many guides on setting up vortex on steam deck and if you can do that you can achieve playable frame rates. I haven‚Äôt set it up personally (not yet anyway)\n\nSo many naysayers are going to tell you how fallout 4 VR will never perform playable on the DECK. This is bullshit.\nPeople like to talk about things they haven‚Äôt tried. I‚Äôve tested this game and I think if you put enough effort in you can get it playable.\n\nPersonally I could play it with vanilla settings even with the lower FPS. But I know from my experience with modding flat Fallout 4 that with ini tweaks and downgrading the texture resolution and draw distances, this game can be made completely VR capable the deck. The great thing about the creation/gamebyro engine is it is versatile.\n\nI will make a new thread soon when I get it running better. If you are like me and have no other way of experiencing fallout 4 VR (with only a steam deck) then I suggest you hang tight as this is a solvable issue.\n\nI haven‚Äôt even touched upon the GPD Win sized texture pack, the downgraded ini files or the load acceleration mods.\n\nIt is possible but for now, we are at the first step. \n\n",

My Steam Deck suddenly stopped working last night.\n\n\n\n# The Problem:\n\n\n\nI was playing a game (*The Walking Dead*), put the Deck into **Sleep Mode**, and when I tried to wake it up, the screen remained black and it wouldn't boot.\n\n\n\n# Chronological Order\n\n\n\n1. **Initial State:** When pressing the power button, the screen remained black, and the **white power LED would flash exactly 3 times** before turning off completely. I tried this multiple times.\n2. **Troubleshooting Attempts:** I followed all standard troubleshooting steps:\n   * Hard reset (holding the power button for 15 seconds).\n   * Attempting to enter the BIOS/Boot Manager (Volume Up + Power).\n3. **Current State (Critical Failure):** After these attempts, the Deck is now **completely unresponsive**.\n   * Pressing the power button does nothing.\n   * **Crucially, when I connect the original charger, the LED next to the USB-C port does NOT light up.** It is not accepting a charge.\n\n\n\n# Context \n\nI understand this is a critical hardware failure (likely the battery circuit or motherboard), but I have a concern regarding support. **I bought the Deck second-hand a few months ago, and it has worked flawlessly until now.**\n\n**My questions for the community are:**\n\n1. Has anyone experienced the exact sequence of the **3 white LED flashes** followed by the Deck completely dying (no power/no charging LED)?\n2. What was your experience with Valve support for a critical hardware failure? Did they require the original proof of purchase (even if the serial number is still under warranty)?\n\nI have already prepared a support ticket for Valve, but any personal experience or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

    "title": "Skyrim VR works nearly perfectly on SteamOS",
    "selftext": "So I previously had a dual boot setup with windows but after it wiped my SteamOS partition during an update, it got wiped itself. Windows is not a viable way to play games unless you tinker and completely disable updates. SteamOS can do 95 percent of things except anti cheat. \n\nAnyway\nSo my previous thread I ran Fallout New Vegas through vorpx on windows and it ran pretty well but after wiping windows I still had the VR itch. \n\nSo I found ALVR works under steam OS so I thought I‚Äôd give it a test, and to my surprise it worked really well with almost no advanced tinkering. \n\nI went to desktop, installed ALVR then SteamVR. Installed the Firewall rules and still had ALVR on my quest 1. \nTried aircarVR as a test and got amazingly smooth performance, much better than I got under Windows, so I got adventurous and tried Skyrim VR.\n\nNow I‚Äôd previously tried to run SkyrimVR under windows and it simply would not work. It would CTD on launch and never worked. I read up some people had got it working but the amount of work was just ridiculous and not worth it. Everyone kept claiming the performance will be awful and unplayable. Well I‚Äôm here to quash that myth. It works amazingly well without mods and completely vanilla. A great start if you just want to play it as is. \n\nIt started up right away, no crashes and straight into the starting room. I loaded my save at whiterun and it performed great. I had a bit of slow down when loading in but other than that, smooth as butter. If you‚Äôre looking for a vanilla experience, I can say it works perfectly. I didn‚Äôt even change the performance preset from medium. If you encounter slowdown, then bumping that down would make it even better.\nIt looked a bit blurry but still completely playable, the blur can be fixed with mods and settings tweaks anyway but I didn‚Äôt do it. \n\nSo if you want to play Skyrim VR, it works on the deck. \nSome quick pointers to finish, \n\nIf you get a black screen with ALVR then you need to add the launch command on the GitHub. You need to add it to run ALVR no exceptions. \n\nMake sure you don‚Äôt suffocate your deck when you VR game, you‚Äôll end up with bad performance throttling and a melted console. Keep it ventilated and performance will remain stable. \n\nI lowered my resolution to match my Quest 1 within steamVR, so if you get performance issues, try lowering yours.\n\nI tried running ALVR in gaming mode but it had a black screen, I didn‚Äôt tinker further but that might be fixable. For now keep the deck in desktop mode for VR\n\nDon‚Äôt bother with windows for just VR. It‚Äôs more hassle than just using SteamOS. I originally dual booted for VR thinking that it would be harder to set up on Linux, I was wrong. SteamVR on Linux works fine. \n\nMy next test will be Fallout 4 VR. I‚Äôve heard the performance from other people‚Äôs tests is not good. It is a bit more demanding than Skyrim. I feel I can fix that with mods though and ini tweaks. It didn‚Äôt launch under windows though, it CTD. So let‚Äôs hope it runs as well and as easy as Skyrim did.\n\nWish me luck ",

(i'm not super technical)\n\n",

    "title": "Fallout 4 VR kinda works on steam deck",
    "selftext": "Okay, so my last post I described how SkyrimVR works really well on the deck. Well I promised you all that I was going to test Fallout 4 VR on the deck. Here are my results. It‚Äôs more work than SkyrimVR and requires more setup.\n\nSo initially it ran like absolute garbage. Barely playable, maybe if i had no other way of playing it, I could put up with it, but I have strong VR Legs. Performance is abysmal and casual players will suffer with it. Begin by lowering all the settings within the performance menu of Fallout 4 VR. \n\nTurn off anti aliasing, shadow distance to low and everything else as low as possible. This will make performance somewhat tolerable. Next step is your resolution settings which are by far the most important when considering performance/FPS of the game.\nYou don‚Äôt change this in the ini file but in steamVR itself. So I have a quest 1. The resolution is about 1400x1600 natively. \n\nSo I set mine to slightly below that. This gives a massive increase to performance. If you don‚Äôt mind pixelation then you can easily achieve playable FPS by going to your steamVR settings and changing it to as low as you can. Obviously most people will struggle though as it can become pretty blurry at that point. \n\nI don‚Äôt think this is the end though. \nYou can install mods manually by extracting them to the game directory. So I installed insignificant object remover and then added it to the plugins file manually.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of work so here is what I did.\n\nI browsed to the fallout 4 VR Install directory which is where the ini files are installed and manually added those mod files to the plugins.txt file.\n\nI know from windows it is usually located in the ‚Äúappdata/fallout 4‚Äù \nIt didn‚Äôt exist for me so I created the plugins.txt file and added the file name of the mod I had extracted manually.\n\nSo copy the name of the ESP file and add a star in front of it. So * then name of installed mod file. Each file name should be one line then press enter if you wish to add another mod underneath. You need to add each mod to a separate line. \n\nUsually on a normal modded fallout 4 install this is done automatically by the mod menu or mod manager in game. Since we are working outside the bounds we will have to do this manually. \nOnce that is done launch the game.\n\nI changed my resolution to 20% as I have a quest 1 and it ran. \n\nPersonally my FPS wasn‚Äôt too good. It was pixelated and felt horrid. Even as a person with strong VR legs it was hard to stomach. \nThis is my first attempt though and I have no doubt that if I installed FPS Mods correctly and tweaked the ini settings I can get this game stable. \n\nNow judging from my experience in flat Fallout 4 modding on low spec systems, I know that you can lower texture resolutions for huge performance increases. There are multiple mods on the nexus to achieve this result but unfortunately I didn‚Äôt test this out.\n\nI 100% know that if I was to install lower resolution mods, disable shadows and other effects I could achieve a high FPS but I didn‚Äôt go that far (yet), but I know it‚Äôs possible. \n\nTLDR: it‚Äôs completely possible to run fallout 4 VR on the steam deck. There are many guides on setting up vortex on steam deck and if you can do that you can achieve playable frame rates. I haven‚Äôt set it up personally (not yet anyway)\n\nSo many naysayers are going to tell you how fallout 4 VR will never perform playable on the DECK. This is bullshit.\nPeople like to talk about things they haven‚Äôt tried. I‚Äôve tested this game and I think if you put enough effort in you can get it playable.\n\nPersonally I could play it with vanilla settings even with the lower FPS. But I know from my experience with modding flat Fallout 4 that with ini tweaks and downgrading the texture resolution and draw distances, this game can be made completely VR capable the deck. The great thing about the creation/gamebyro engine is it is versatile.\n\nI will make a new thread soon when I get it running better. If you are like me and have no other way of experiencing fallout 4 VR (with only a steam deck) then I suggest you hang tight as this is a solvable issue.\n\nI haven‚Äôt even touched upon the GPD Win sized texture pack, the downgraded ini files or the load acceleration mods.\n\nIt is possible but for now, we are at the first step. \n\n",

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n¬†\n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n¬†\n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\n\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n¬†\n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered).¬†\n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n¬†\n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\n\n\nSmart bulbs (Tr√•dfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n¬†\n\nAm I missing anything?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4).

NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2).

The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe‚Äôre still in development and not selling anything yet ‚Äî just trying to see if there‚Äôs real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "Hi all\n\nKind of an odd post for this thread but I own a commercial bakery and I have a need for an air pressure sensor. Basically if we have negative air pressure in the room I risk burning up my oven control units very quickly. As you can imagine this is expensive both to repair and both in time. Air pressure can be controlled with the facilitation of a make up air system and multiple exhaust fans that can be individually switched on and off. \n\nIdeally I‚Äôd have sensor that goes off and sounds an audible alarm if say there is too much negative air pressure so that the bakers can adjust things.\n\nDoes something like this exist ready to go out of the box?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob ü§∑\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on¬†https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0‚Äì360, S and V are 0‚Äì1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01‚Ä¶81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests ‚Äúindex‚Äù is the zero-based LED position inside the device‚Äôs internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` ‚Üí hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 ‚Ä¶` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the ‚Äúapply‚Äù byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 ‚Ä¶`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n‚Ä¢ Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n‚Ä¢ Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n‚Ä¢ Working zone writes: `‚Ä¶ 81 01` to `‚Ä¶ 81 04`  \n‚Ä¢ Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n‚Ä¢ Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n‚Ä¢ Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.

(and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n¬†\n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n¬†\n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\n\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n¬†\n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered).¬†\n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n¬†\n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\n\n\nSmart bulbs (Tr√•dfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n¬†\n\nAm I missing anything?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras.

Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1).

My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room?

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe‚Äôre still in development and not selling anything yet ‚Äî just trying to see if there‚Äôs real value in this idea.

Air pressure can be controlled with the facilitation of a make up air system and multiple exhaust fans that can be individually switched on and off. \n\nIdeally I‚Äôd have sensor that goes off and sounds an audible alarm if say there is too much negative air pressure so that the bakers can adjust things.\n\nDoes something like this exist ready to go out of the box?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n¬†\n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n¬†\n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\n\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n¬†\n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered).¬†\n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n¬†\n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\n\n\nSmart bulbs (Tr√•dfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n¬†\n\nAm I missing anything?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5).

NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "There must be a way to fix this. I just replaced a years old Nest Hello (wired) doorbell camera with a new Nest wired 3rd Gen doorbell.  The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said ‚Äúno‚Äù and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

    "selftext": "Hi, I need some advice please.  I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

    "selftext": "I always see Aqura FP2 sensors on youtube videos being used for some cool things.  I also read that most people put them in a box after a while cause theyre unreliable.  Ive spent so much time trying to set up an automation (using home assistant) to turn on and off the lights in an open concept main floor but i always get caught up with ghosting and inefficiencies.  Is there a way to increase the reliability of this automation?  I have plenty of windows, a cat and its a big open area.  Whether it be a better product or the FP2 in combination with another sensor?  Would really enjoy a cool working situation with automatic lights when you step in a zone.\n\n**Right now:**  \n**If you walk in the livingroom area, kitchen or sitting area, lights go on in their respective locations.**\n\n**(after a while i added this one since on and off when you walk back and forth is annoying)**  \n**The lights turn off after 5 min of no activity**",

Thank you all so much, I really appreciate this community so much. \n\n\n\nHi all, thank you in advance for any insight you can provide.\n\n**Prior to our issues:** we have a Google Home and multiple brands/types of smart devices. All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

    "selftext": "Hello! Our house which we moved into a few months ago has a strange beeping sound. It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I‚Äôve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox ‚Äî mostly because it supports Matter and doesn‚Äôt need a separate hub.\n\nHere‚Äôs my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn‚Äôt connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz ‚Äî after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It‚Äôs surprisingly consistent ‚Äî every morning when I‚Äôm still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a ‚ÄúMovie mode‚Äù scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they‚Äôre showing around 85%. I‚Äôll update if that changes, but it looks like they‚Äôll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly ‚Äî not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went ‚Äúno response‚Äù üòÖ.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding ‚Äî but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt‚Äôs not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected ‚Äî thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn‚Äôt super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn‚Äôt bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that‚Äôs fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything ‚Äî I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn‚Äôt drop connection every other day.\nIf you‚Äôre building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I‚Äôll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

Right now, I have to turn it by hand every time, but I‚Äôd love to find a way to automate this process.\n\nIdeally, I need something easy to set up that can make the knob turn one notch to the right, or one (at most two) to the left, to bring it back to zero. I don‚Äôt need full remote control, just a simple solution that can handle this small motion‚Äîso I can avoid having to do it manually each time.\n\nHas anybody tried something similar or have any tips or suggestions for a device or hack I could use? Any help would be really appreciated.",

Sure enough, I was prompted to login and it logged in successfully this time, and my device was listed. Hit the power button via the app and sure enough it went off.\n\nWent into SmartThings linked services and reconnected it successfully to the Sengled cloud. Device is now controllable again in Smartthings.\n\nI know most (if not all) people that have Sengled devices have moved on to non-cloud dependent devices, but figured anyone that still has a Sengled device and has been using the manual control button since their cloud service went offline, might want to know that it's back up again. Guess we'll see how long it lasts this time.\n\n  \nEdit: 10/20/2025 was when traffic started logging in my firewall again for the Sengled device.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

(Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said ‚Äúno‚Äù and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

There‚Äôs also a $50 bill credit for using a referral code during signup.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to do it right away either ‚Äî you can activate the Vivint part anytime after you‚Äôre enrolled through their app or website.\n\nBoth devices work with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can do voice control for temperature, doorbell notifications, etc. No HomeKit yet, unfortunately.\n\nIf anyone wants the exact page or referral code that makes the $50 credit work, I can drop it in the comments.\n\nyou can also type LTMXR2K on Reliant Energy's site during signup for the $50 credit.  You can get the Vivint smarthome hardware and install with or without the code.",

Thank you all so much, I really appreciate this community so much. \n\n\n\nHi all, thank you in advance for any insight you can provide.\n\n**Prior to our issues:** we have a Google Home and multiple brands/types of smart devices. All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

    "selftext": "Hello! Our house which we moved into a few months ago has a strange beeping sound. It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said ‚Äúno‚Äù and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

Not after battery changes, just randomly. Over time one of my indoor sensors has become completely undetectable.\n\nI'm looking to upgrade but honestly I'm not very impressed with my Grovee experience. Maybe I just bought the wrong model? There seem to be so many different options of Grovee set ups, some of which have been talked about here but I'm afraid of a repeat performance from a new Grovee set up. Is there a better option out there? What have you been using and for how long?\n\nMy Desires:\n\n- Amazon Alexa (I would like to be able to link to Alexa so I can ask temp/humidity of certain sensors)\n- Android Widget Option\n- Less than $200 for set up (5 sensors preferred)",

His Setup is below:\n\nGPU Radeon RTX 7700XT OC 12GB DDR6 192 bit\n\nCPU AMD Ryzen 5-5600G, stock wraith cooler\n\nMobo Gigabyte B550M Aorus Elite mATX AM4\n\nRAM Corsair Vengance DDR4 2x 8GB 3200MHz CL16\n\nPower supply Corsair RM750 (2023) Modular Low noise ATX 80 Plus Gold\n\nCrucial P3 1TBM.2PCIe Gen 3 NVMe SSD\n\nCase CiT Crossfire Airflow mATX with 3x front 1x Rear fans\n\nI'm hoping some people here can advise ways to get some more capability out of the current setup or suggest possible upgrades which would make a noticable difference. He only plays at 1080p so I'm of the opinin the above should be plenty capable of 90 plus frame rates and med to high settings at 1080p? Am I wrong, or is there any component here that may be holding back performance??",

    "title": "PC FULL SCREEN FREEZES NOTHING WORKS.",
    "selftext": "READ THE WHOLE DESCRIPTION BEFORE REPLYING ANYTHING\nIm just going to write this here cause i dont know where else to ask. I got this pc Dell build like 2.5 years ago. New, worked fine for like 2 years maybe. Then it all went bad. Had windows 11. Didnt really go to many sketchy sites, here and there downlosded something but not malicious sites. Everything double, tripple checked. Used brave, used kaspersky. Anything suspicious was out. Pc wasnt slow or anything but a few months ago it began. Sudden full screen freezes, mouse didnt work, keyboard either, sounds stoppped, all glitched out. Everything was frozen. Didnt matter if i played games or the pc sat idle doing nothing. Happened several times in mornings or after keeping pc off and then nothing. Everything went back to normal. So i ignored it for a while, cause i didnt know how to solve it and i thought the fixer would just reset my pc as my  dad put such an idea in my head.  Anyway, it was fine for a while, freezes sometimes, sometimes not. Then the SSD card began breaking. Corrupted windows, tried fixing with cmd commands. Then ut got worse. Ssd card needed replacement otherwise pc was sloth slow. Then turns out GPU was next. Replaced that, worked fine for a day or two. Then blue screen \"your device ran into a problem and needs to restart\" first time it was done soon, now stuck at 0% another forced shutdown. And now it starts the same problem  as it was before the SSD change. The HDD remains the same bus its a side card and never acted oddly so i didnt replace it. Any recomendations besides getting a new pc?",

That worked fine when I had a 16:9 monitor, however with a 21:9 monitor, the image is very stretched out.\n\nI actually briefly ended up with 2 ultrawide monitors; while I still had the second one, as a test I connected it to the tower directly with both HDMI as well as Displayport. Both times, the ultrawide connected via wireless HDMI then showed a normal, non-stretched image. Since that worked, would it be logical that plugging in a headless emulator/dummy adapter that supports the monitor's resolution also work?\n\nI have found this on that claims to support a resolution of 3440x1440.

I have a gigabyte z690 aorus elite ax v1.0 motherboard and a gigabyte rtx 3080ti. After installing the cpu and ram, I got everything back together and hooked up the pc. My display ports are going into my gpu only. The pc starts and the gpu‚Äôs fans spin to begin with when power stares up signifying they are getting power. However, the rgb on the gigabyte logo does not come on. I get visual to my monitors. This is where things get wonky. My resolution is capped at 1080p and when going to my pc about settings, it says there‚Äôs no gpu installed. Nothing showing up in my device manager. Looking at my bios, I think it shows there‚Äôs something hooked up to pciex16 slot but I‚Äôm not fluent with bios stuff so that could mean nothing. Any ideas on where to start with this? Also updated my bios before installing the cpu due to all the 14th gen intel chip issues I needed the update they rolled out to fix it.\n\nUpdate: \nJust tried my gpu in the secondary pcie slot. Nada. Same results as the first slot. Really hoping this isn‚Äôt a busted gpu and just some cpu or bios issue\n\nUpdate 2: \nGetting very weird. When I did my bios update, I noticed this same thing where my resolution went to crap starting back up but it seemed to fix itself after a few minutes. I didn‚Äôt think to check if my gpu was working at the time. Just let the pc sit for a sec rn and the resolution seemed to fix itself.

    "selftext": "Hello, I've been having an issue for months now and finally decided to seek some help as it's grown irritating.\n\nTLDR\nFor months now my computer has two issues I believe are connected, one is that sometimes (almost only when i turn the monitor on after its been off, or when starting my computer up) the monitor appears all black with horizontal and vertical flickering lines. Oddly enough, when it happens after starting my computer it always loads the Alienware loading screen that buffers, but only glitches once it switches to the lock screen afterwards.\n\nThe second issue that's been happening concurrently but more rarely, is that at random the screen will freeze completely then start turning black (not off, monitor will still be on) for a few seconds, then switch back to the frozen screen. It'll repeat this till I restart my pc via power button. I've been in call on discord a couple times when this has happened, and I was still able to hear people in call while it was freezing but oddly they became unable to hear myself.\n\n I've looked into solutions for this, but can't find any solid enough. I thought it might've been the monitor at first, but the fact restarting the computer fixes it and that the looping freeze cuts off my mic makes me question that. Hoping someone here will have the knowledge needed.\n\nI'm using a Alienware Aurora Ryzen Edition R10, with Windows 11, and a ASUS VG248QG monitor. I can provide additional details if needed\n\nSorry for the rough photos, but here's what the monitor glitch looks like (not the periodic freezing issue) \nhttps://i.ibb.co/zV9M3TBx/20251026-223111.jpg\nhttps://i.ibb.co/wZnh8hy7/20251026-223100.jpg",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently built a new PC and I‚Äôve run into a strange issue. When I power it on, the BIOS loads perfectly fine ‚Äî I can access it and everything looks normal. But once it moves past the BIOS screen to boot into Windows, my display goes completely black.\n\nThe only way I can get a picture back is by unplugging my DisplayPort cable and plugging it into another DisplayPort slot on my GPU. After that, Windows loads normally and everything works fine (no performance or stability issues once I‚Äôm in).\n\nI‚Äôm running an **RTX 5080** on the latest drivers and firmware, with a **DisplayPort 1.4 cable** and a 4K monitor. I‚Äôve already tried:\n\n* Updating BIOS and GPU drivers\n* Swapping DisplayPort cables\n* Changing which DisplayPort on the GPU I use\n* Re-seating the GPU and checking connections\n\nSame issue every time. BIOS shows fine, but Windows startup = black screen until I switch DisplayPort ports.\n\nHas anyone run into something similar or found a fix? Is this an issue with early 5080 firmware, DisplayPort handshake, or something else?\n\nThanks in advance for any ideas",

The first (which came with the computer) lasted a while, about 2 and a half years, and about a year of that was finnicky. It would only work in certain outlets at certain angles, I finally bit the bullet and bought a new one and this one has only lasted about a month! It seems to be the same issue, only working in some outlets but im so tired of it that I've barely even tried it in many outlets this time. I'm starting to think it may be an issue with the actual charger port, does anyone have any advice. I can't afford a repair right now, I've checked and was quoted upwards of 800 dollars which I just can't swing if it's not necessary. I'm a student and a writing arts major so I really need a computer that works. Any advice is so appreciated ",

    "selftext": "Hello! My friend's laptop is suddenly throwing up recovery errors when she turns it on. It's had a few different error codes come up, including 0xc0000098 and 0xc0000221.\n\nApparently, she updated it to Windows 11 on Friday and it struggled to do so, but she got it to work... until last night when this mess started.\n\nNow we can't get it to do anything, as the laptop freezes on the recovery screen (which gets pixelated), and it does not respond to the keyboard. Based on some googling, I don't think it was actually able to handle the update, and it might have overheated enough to damage hardware inside. But I wanted to get a second opinion and see what we might have to replace, if she just wants to get it working long enough to save files from it?\n\nSpecs:\n\nLaptop - Lenovo Yoga C740-15IML\n\nProcessor - 1x 10th Generation Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-10510U Processor(Core‚Ñ¢ i7-10510U)\n\nMemory - 1x 8GB DDR4 2666\n\nHard Drive - 1x 512GB NVMe",

When my PC booted back up, it became stuck on the BIOS menu. I tried restarting a few times to get back to my desktop, but it kept going to the BIOS. I only then noticed that my boot priority and Boot Menu are completely empty (see images 1 and 2), as if my Windows OS was corrupted, and the boot steps were missing.\n\nSo to try and fix this, I got a windows 11 boot drive so I could use the 'repair my PC' and troubleshooting options. I couldn't find an easy solution with it. I used the command prompt to show me what's on the drive, and it looked completely wrong, as if all files were gone (see images 3, 4, 5, and 6). I also opened notepad to get a version of windows explorer and see the drive, and both the free and total size seem wrong, as well as internal files all being gone, like Program Files and Users (images 7 and 8).\n\nIt looks like my C: drive is completely corrupted, so should I just reformat my PC and get a fresh new windows installation? Is there any chance I can recover my data? Any help or advice anyone can offer will be helpful, thank you.",

When I save the finished work on my computer, I save it as a .png file, as I've been told that Windows doesn't allow transparent backgrounds for .jpg files. \n\nBut when I go to my Desktop (where I save the images), the thumbnail always shows a black background. When I click on it, the image window opens and the black background appears for a heartbeat before disappearing. If I cycle through my images, the black background reappears for a heartbeat before disappearing.\n\nConfused, I open Adobe Illustrator again to see if Windows has added a black background to the image despite me specifically stating that I want it to have a transparent one. I import the image and, lo and behold, the background is transparent.\n\nSo I think, \"Alright, it's just Windows being screwy. No big deal.\" I go to upload the images onto my DeviantArt page and the images have a black background!\n\nWhat is going on here?

To then be faced with the message, \"Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation.\"\n\nFollowing that I tried to run \"DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\" and it returned with Error 1009 - \"The configuration registry database is corrupt.

If I try again immediately, I go back into windows recovery and the recovery fails. If I wait an hour or so, I can boot to Windows normally but then it crashes and restarts into windows recovery again. Please help, what can I do to stop this loop? My laptop worked fine before the update!\n\nThanks for any advice!! ",

    "title": "Monitor Glitching and Computer Freezing",
    "selftext": "Hello, I've been having an issue for months now and finally decided to seek some help as it's grown irritating.\n\nTLDR\nFor months now my computer has two issues I believe are connected, one is that sometimes (almost only when i turn the monitor on after its been off, or when starting my computer up) the monitor appears all black with horizontal and vertical flickering lines. Oddly enough, when it happens after starting my computer it always loads the Alienware loading screen that buffers, but only glitches once it switches to the lock screen afterwards.\n\nThe second issue that's been happening concurrently but more rarely, is that at random the screen will freeze completely then start turning black (not off, monitor will still be on) for a few seconds, then switch back to the frozen screen. It'll repeat this till I restart my pc via power button. I've been in call on discord a couple times when this has happened, and I was still able to hear people in call while it was freezing but oddly they became unable to hear myself.\n\n I've looked into solutions for this, but can't find any solid enough. I thought it might've been the monitor at first, but the fact restarting the computer fixes it and that the looping freeze cuts off my mic makes me question that. Hoping someone here will have the knowledge needed.\n\nI'm using a Alienware Aurora Ryzen Edition R10, with Windows 11, and a ASUS VG248QG monitor. I can provide additional details if needed\n\nSorry for the rough photos, but here's what the monitor glitch looks like (not the periodic freezing issue) \nhttps://i.ibb.co/zV9M3TBx/20251026-223111.jpg\nhttps://i.ibb.co/wZnh8hy7/20251026-223100.jpg",

    "selftext": "READ THE WHOLE DESCRIPTION BEFORE REPLYING ANYTHING\nIm just going to write this here cause i dont know where else to ask. I got this pc Dell build like 2.5 years ago. New, worked fine for like 2 years maybe. Then it all went bad. Had windows 11. Didnt really go to many sketchy sites, here and there downlosded something but not malicious sites. Everything double, tripple checked. Used brave, used kaspersky. Anything suspicious was out. Pc wasnt slow or anything but a few months ago it began. Sudden full screen freezes, mouse didnt work, keyboard either, sounds stoppped, all glitched out. Everything was frozen. Didnt matter if i played games or the pc sat idle doing nothing. Happened several times in mornings or after keeping pc off and then nothing. Everything went back to normal. So i ignored it for a while, cause i didnt know how to solve it and i thought the fixer would just reset my pc as my  dad put such an idea in my head.  Anyway, it was fine for a while, freezes sometimes, sometimes not. Then the SSD card began breaking. Corrupted windows, tried fixing with cmd commands. Then ut got worse. Ssd card needed replacement otherwise pc was sloth slow. Then turns out GPU was next. Replaced that, worked fine for a day or two. Then blue screen \"your device ran into a problem and needs to restart\" first time it was done soon, now stuck at 0% another forced shutdown. And now it starts the same problem  as it was before the SSD change. The HDD remains the same bus its a side card and never acted oddly so i didnt replace it. Any recomendations besides getting a new pc?",

Both times, the ultrawide connected via wireless HDMI then showed a normal, non-stretched image.

I have a gigabyte z690 aorus elite ax v1.0 motherboard and a gigabyte rtx 3080ti. After installing the cpu and ram, I got everything back together and hooked up the pc. My display ports are going into my gpu only. The pc starts and the gpu‚Äôs fans spin to begin with when power stares up signifying they are getting power. However, the rgb on the gigabyte logo does not come on. I get visual to my monitors. This is where things get wonky. My resolution is capped at 1080p and when going to my pc about settings, it says there‚Äôs no gpu installed. Nothing showing up in my device manager. Looking at my bios, I think it shows there‚Äôs something hooked up to pciex16 slot but I‚Äôm not fluent with bios stuff so that could mean nothing. Any ideas on where to start with this? Also updated my bios before installing the cpu due to all the 14th gen intel chip issues I needed the update they rolled out to fix it.\n\nUpdate: \nJust tried my gpu in the secondary pcie slot. Nada. Same results as the first slot. Really hoping this isn‚Äôt a busted gpu and just some cpu or bios issue\n\nUpdate 2: \nGetting very weird. When I did my bios update, I noticed this same thing where my resolution went to crap starting back up but it seemed to fix itself after a few minutes. I didn‚Äôt think to check if my gpu was working at the time. Just let the pc sit for a sec rn and the resolution seemed to fix itself.

    "title": "Monitor Glitching and Computer Freezing",
    "selftext": "Hello, I've been having an issue for months now and finally decided to seek some help as it's grown irritating.\n\nTLDR\nFor months now my computer has two issues I believe are connected, one is that sometimes (almost only when i turn the monitor on after its been off, or when starting my computer up) the monitor appears all black with horizontal and vertical flickering lines. Oddly enough, when it happens after starting my computer it always loads the Alienware loading screen that buffers, but only glitches once it switches to the lock screen afterwards.\n\nThe second issue that's been happening concurrently but more rarely, is that at random the screen will freeze completely then start turning black (not off, monitor will still be on) for a few seconds, then switch back to the frozen screen. It'll repeat this till I restart my pc via power button. I've been in call on discord a couple times when this has happened, and I was still able to hear people in call while it was freezing but oddly they became unable to hear myself.\n\n I've looked into solutions for this, but can't find any solid enough. I thought it might've been the monitor at first, but the fact restarting the computer fixes it and that the looping freeze cuts off my mic makes me question that. Hoping someone here will have the knowledge needed.\n\nI'm using a Alienware Aurora Ryzen Edition R10, with Windows 11, and a ASUS VG248QG monitor. I can provide additional details if needed\n\nSorry for the rough photos, but here's what the monitor glitch looks like (not the periodic freezing issue) \nhttps://i.ibb.co/zV9M3TBx/20251026-223111.jpg\nhttps://i.ibb.co/wZnh8hy7/20251026-223100.jpg",

But even if the charger leaks current the well built iPhone shouldn't right?",
