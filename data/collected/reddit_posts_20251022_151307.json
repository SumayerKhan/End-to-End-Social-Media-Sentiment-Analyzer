First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

Why at least not make it a little bigger on a redesign or something to compete? I like USB-C, but I was always curious why Apple never continued to innovate a good port and cash cow.",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI’d like to share the app I’ve been working on over the past few months - **Dory**.\n\nI think the video does a much better job of explaining what it’s all about, so feel free to check it out here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z\\_Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z_Q)\n\n**Dory is an app switcher that lets you quickly cycle through apps without moving your hand from the mouse, keyboard or trackpad - and without needing to remember any shortcuts.**\n\nClick a mouse button - or a modifier key if both hands are on the keyboard - and type the first letter of the app’s name.\n\nFind apps using the first letter, middle letters, acronyms, or similar names.\n\nIf multiple apps share that letter, just keep tapping it to cycle through them.\n\nYou can also press the middle mouse button and start typing the app’s name directly.\n\nPrefer tapping over holding? No problem. With Press Mode, you can open Dory’s sleek UI using a global shortcut or a **trackpad gesture!** (new)\n\nDory works right out of the box - and over time, it learns which apps you use most and prioritizes them.\n\nNo extra shortcuts.\n\nNo setup. Nothing to remember.\n\n\\--\n\nIt's currently $4.99 on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dory-app-switcher/id6746273626?mt=12) (**One-time purchase**. **No subscription.**) for a limited time.",

    "selftext": "* **Touch-Screen MacBook Pro Incoming:** Apple is preparing to launch a touch-screen MacBook Pro, reversing its long-standing stance against touch interfaces on Macs.\n* **Release Timeline:** Expected in late 2026 or early 2027.\n* **Key Features:**\n   * OLED display technology (first time in a Mac).\n   * Hole-punch camera design replacing the notch.\n   * Thinner, lighter frames.\n   * Reinforced hinge to improve touch stability.\n   * M6 chip line.\n* **User Experience:** Will retain full keyboard and trackpad, allowing users to choose between touch and traditional input.\n* **Pricing:** Likely to be several hundred dollars more than current models due to premium components.\n* **Strategic Shift:** Apple is testing market response before expanding touch to other Mac models.\n* **Historical Context:** This marks a major shift from Steve Jobs’ and Tim Cook’s earlier criticisms of touch-screen laptops.",

In our dataset, it had a spike to almost 40% in the middle of September, but came back a bit after that.\n\nCompare to macOS 15 which exactly one year ago had 50% of the market share. \n\nObviously, it is just a subset. But the drop from 40 to 30% is pretty significant even for that subset. (Based on https://telemetrydeck.com/platforms/swift/ - 6,280 apps use it, but that includes macOS and iOS apps)\n\nPS. I am a macOS indie app developer, but I personally do not use TelemetryDeck and I am not in any way related to them. Just found this data being really interesting, so decided to share.  ",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAbout two months ago I released a major update to my weather app [Sonuby Weather](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1560347507?pt=122856099&ct=r_apple_october_2025&mt=8), which some of you might remember from my [Promo Sunday post last December](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1hjwv12/i_built_a_fully_customizable_forecast_app_for/).\n\nThe latest update features the first truly configurable weather widgets for iOS, letting you build your personal forecast dashboard right on your home screen.\n\n**Here's what makes them special:**\n\n* **3 widget types** \\- Now & Next Hours (up to 42h on iPad), Next Days (up to 12 days), and Now & Next Hours Extended for twice the variables\n* **9 specialized reports** \\- Choose between Daily Life, Health, Snow Sports, Surfing, Photography, Hiking, and more - each showing relevant variables for that activity\n* **Truly customizable** \\- Don't like the default layout? Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

I tried it with different c-type cables of other (android) devices, and the phone gets charged without any problem. Although, I have heard that using other a cable other than apple's is not very healthy for my hardware. So, apparently either there is a problem with my socket or the cable. What do you guys think I should do? Try out a new cable? Get my socket checked? Or just buy the magnetic charger?",

    "selftext": "Apparently the demand just isn’t there? This is a device with very real compromises (not a dig, just an objective statement) but I would’ve expected it to sell well enough overall. I genuinely hoped it wouldn’t be another iPhone Mini, but this isn’t what I meant. Does this feel accurate for you, fellow Redditors? Is this one just going to be a slow burn or is it going to fizzle? And if so, why? The b-word is too much a low hanging fruit and they did introduce the MagSafe pack for those times when one really needs the extra juice. If anything I would expect the camera to be the trade-off that might be stopping people, especially those they were already on the iPhone Pro, which was the same price point last year. Especially like to hear from any people that went from a 15 or 16 Pro to the Air. What did you miss? Do you think it will be worth it long time or do you think you may end up trading in again next year? (Or sooner?) This is the first major change in design Apple has made in quite a while so it’s interesting times.\n\nAll I know for sure is I’m in a pretty iPhone heavy microcosm and I’m the kind of guy that notices other people’s devices, as I’m always half feeling the urge to upgrade. But I’ve yet to see *one* iPhone Air in the wild although I’ve seen multiple 17 Pro’s — can’t mistake that plateau and triple array — while I’d expected to see at a couple Airs though.\n\nIt’s also entirely possible that Apple anticipated the air itself might be a flash in the pan and it’s prepared to completely replace it with an “iPhone Fold” or “iPhone Ultra.” Although I expected next year’s lineup to be iPhone, iPhone Air 2, iPhone Ultra.

    "selftext": "Every year we argue about titanium vs aluminum, bezels, battery cycles, camera bumps, charging speeds, AI buzzwords, etc… and then we completely ignore the one feature Apple shipped in the last few years that actually changed how you use the phone in daily life. Dynamic Island wasn’t “new hardware”, it was a UX decision. Apple took a problem (the camera cutout) and turned it into UI real estate. Music controls, navigation, timers, live activities, authentication, calls, AirPods, it all lives there now. You don’t think about it, you just use it. And that’s the whole point: good design disappears into behavior.\n\nTake it away tomorrow and I guarantee most people would feel something is “missing” immediately. I can’t say the same about the Action Button or about most of the “new” things Apple ships lately.\n\nThe funniest part to me is that Android manufacturers copy Apple instantly when something is shallow (removing accessories, changing ports, renaming modes, etc), but after 3 years nobody even tried to copy the Dynamic Island. Not because they don’t want to, but because that kind of idea requires real integration between hardware and system UI, not just a checkbox feature.\n\nTo me, Dynamic Island is one of the most quietly brilliant Apple moves in years, and people treat it like a minor bullet point.\n\n",

    "selftext": "After 6 loyal years with my OnePlus 7Pro, the device finally gave up on me. It had been flawless all these years, but one random afternoon — mid doomscroll — it decided to retire. No drama, no warning it just switched off like, “That’s enough internet for one lifetime.” Just gone. \n\nThe local repair folks declared it a “CPU and RAM issue” — tech-speak for “it’s gone, bro.” Meanwhile, OnePlus customer support gave me the final nail in the coffin: “Your device has reached end of life. We don’t have spare parts anymore.”\n\nTranslation: We’ve moved on. You should too.\n\nAnd that’s when I knew it was time.\nEnter: the iPhone 17 🍏\n\nHonestly, this felt like the most obvious upgrade for me. I’d been waiting for Apple to bring ProMotion to the base models ever since I first experienced that silky 90Hz refresh rate on my OnePlus — and now that it’s here, it feels so worth the wait. The same screen as the iPhone 17 Pro, the bump in base storage, and that trademark Apple refinement — it feels like the first time in years the baseline model doesn’t feel “less than.” It’s smooth, fast, and feels complete.\n\nAnd then… there’s the Sage Green. 💚🤑\nI didn’t think a colour could make me fall in love with a phone, but this shade did it. It’s calm, clean, and has that understated premium vibe — not shouting for attention, just quietly flexing in good lighting. Easily one of Apple’s best colour choices in a long time.\n\nThe phone is ridiculously smooth. ProMotion makes scrolling feel like butter, the battery life’s solid, and the cameras finally feel flagship-level even without the “Pro” tag. It’s funny — my OnePlus 7 Pro was the first phone that made me care about displays. And now, six years later, it’s Apple’s screen that’s making me smile every time I unlock it.\n\nFeels like a full cycle shifting from iPhone for better screen and specs and now — back with that familiar iPhone feeling I missed the past 6 years with “Pro” level upgrades.\n\nSafe to say, the iPhone 17 is exactly what I wanted it to be. A proper upgrade, not just a newer phone.\n",

That keeps the screen at 480 Hz and doesn't give me a headache.\n\nI bought an iPhone air and I've been using it for a week. With those settings I can use it fine. But the problem is that it gets hot and thermal throttles and dims the screen itself, even from simple things like scrolling on Google or taking some photos in a regular temperature room. I'm not in a tropical climate or out in the sun or anything.\n\nI'm gonna have to return it and I'm sad cause it was the first time I've been able to update my phone in a very long time. I also need a bigger screen for disability reasons. \n\nI read on here a lot of people were talking about how much better the cooling was in the pro and max, and that it wasn't fully shutting down or showing a thermometer, or dimming to the point that you can't see the screen.\n\nBut I'm wondering about any dimming at all, even just a bit of dimming. My air wouldn't overheat and shut down, but it would just dim the screen a chunk and that was enough to give me PWM symptoms again. \n\nSo has anyone noticed any screen dimming on their pro/Max?

    "selftext": "I bought this 15pro second hand for cheaper than market price. When I first saw it irl, I noticed the damage on top left of phone as shown in the picture. I questioned the seller and they just said it happened while they were taking off the screen protector. They then noted that ever since updating to ios 26, the phone started to lag and sometimes screen would freeze. They told me I can just close and open the phone back using power button, and it would work normally again. However, I didn't think much of it as it was just a tiny part of the screen and the display worked perfectly fine.\n\nWhen I first started using, I noticed that I would get ghost touches. Like when you're scrolling through social media and you touch top part of the screen, the posts go all the way back to first post. This started to get annoying real fast. \n\nMoreover, the screen also froze frequently. Even when closing it and opening it back using the power button, the screen would remain frozen for a while, then will start working again. It's also strange because the touch to wake function remains working. Like I can wake the phone using that, but phone will remain frozen on lock screen for a while. \n\nI have a feeling all of this is related to that specific area, and I'm assuming water somehow went inside. Thinking back, the seller was probably fishy, and didn't really highlight the problems properly. I reached back to the seller later and they are unwilling to give a refund. All the other functions work perfectly fine though.\n\nI took it to an apple repair store and they said they would have to replace the screen which costs like half the price of a new phone so it's not an option for me. They also confirmed that it's highly unlikely it's due to software, and that it's also not because of the ios update that the seller insisted on.\n\nI wanna know what your thoughts are on this, and what my other options are, if I have any. Would replacing it with unoriginal screen be a bad idea? What other things can I try to do to save it? What would you do if you were in my position?",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,\nJust curious — how many of you actually use Always-On Display (AOD) on your phones daily?\n\nI’ve been testing it for a while, and honestly, I’m kind of torn. On one hand, it looks sleek and makes checking time or notifications effortless. But on the other, I feel like it’s quietly nibbling away at my battery life for no real reason — especially since I still end up tapping the screen half the time out of habit anyway 😅.\n\nEspecially on the latest iPhones running iOS 26, I’m noticing mixed opinions — some say Apple’s optimized it really well, others say battery drain is still noticeable.\n\nSo I’m wondering — do most of you just leave it on all the time, or do you prefer keeping it off to save battery? And if you do keep it on, does it actually make your day-to-day use better, or is it more of a “looks cool but meh” feature?\n\nLet’s settle this once and for all — AOD gang vs. battery conservation squad\n(and please, I know there’s a battery megathread already — this one’s just about usage and preference",

Is there any easier way to use the iPhone one-handed, like gestures, accessibility settings, or layout tweaks that could make navigation more comfortable?",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "selftext": "After 6 loyal years with my OnePlus 7Pro, the device finally gave up on me. It had been flawless all these years, but one random afternoon — mid doomscroll — it decided to retire. No drama, no warning it just switched off like, “That’s enough internet for one lifetime.” Just gone. \n\nThe local repair folks declared it a “CPU and RAM issue” — tech-speak for “it’s gone, bro.” Meanwhile, OnePlus customer support gave me the final nail in the coffin: “Your device has reached end of life. We don’t have spare parts anymore.”\n\nTranslation: We’ve moved on. You should too.\n\nAnd that’s when I knew it was time.\nEnter: the iPhone 17 🍏\n\nHonestly, this felt like the most obvious upgrade for me. I’d been waiting for Apple to bring ProMotion to the base models ever since I first experienced that silky 90Hz refresh rate on my OnePlus — and now that it’s here, it feels so worth the wait. The same screen as the iPhone 17 Pro, the bump in base storage, and that trademark Apple refinement — it feels like the first time in years the baseline model doesn’t feel “less than.” It’s smooth, fast, and feels complete.\n\nAnd then… there’s the Sage Green. 💚🤑\nI didn’t think a colour could make me fall in love with a phone, but this shade did it. It’s calm, clean, and has that understated premium vibe — not shouting for attention, just quietly flexing in good lighting. Easily one of Apple’s best colour choices in a long time.\n\nThe phone is ridiculously smooth. ProMotion makes scrolling feel like butter, the battery life’s solid, and the cameras finally feel flagship-level even without the “Pro” tag. It’s funny — my OnePlus 7 Pro was the first phone that made me care about displays. And now, six years later, it’s Apple’s screen that’s making me smile every time I unlock it.\n\nFeels like a full cycle shifting from iPhone for better screen and specs and now — back with that familiar iPhone feeling I missed the past 6 years with “Pro” level upgrades.\n\nSafe to say, the iPhone 17 is exactly what I wanted it to be. A proper upgrade, not just a newer phone.\n",

Dynamic Island wasn’t “new hardware”, it was a UX decision. Apple took a problem (the camera cutout) and turned it into UI real estate. Music controls, navigation, timers, live activities, authentication, calls, AirPods, it all lives there now. You don’t think about it, you just use it. And that’s the whole point: good design disappears into behavior.\n\nTake it away tomorrow and I guarantee most people would feel something is “missing” immediately. I can’t say the same about the Action Button or about most of the “new” things Apple ships lately.\n\nThe funniest part to me is that Android manufacturers copy Apple instantly when something is shallow (removing accessories, changing ports, renaming modes, etc), but after 3 years nobody even tried to copy the Dynamic Island. Not because they don’t want to, but because that kind of idea requires real integration between hardware and system UI, not just a checkbox feature.\n\nTo me, Dynamic Island is one of the most quietly brilliant Apple moves in years, and people treat it like a minor bullet point.\n\n",

    "title": "Defective Cases and Censorship: My Caudabe Experience",
    "selftext": "So I wanted to share a really disappointing experience with Caudabe today. I figured I’d change things up from the usual Dbrand case. What a mistake.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both got new iPhone Airs and ordered a pair of Caudabe Sheath cases directly from their site. Both arrived this morning, and both had quality issues right out of the box:\n\n•\tThe black Sheath was badly warped, and even came missing the unlock/sleep button, making it completely unusable.\n\n•\tThe green Sheath was also slightly warped and had green shavings around the camera cutout, just like leftover material on a rough 3D print.\n\n•\tThe packaging was undamaged, so this clearly happened before shipping.\n\nGiven Caudabe’s premium pricing, this kind of quality control issue is completely unacceptable. You’d expect something like this from a cheap $10 Amazon case, not from a brand that markets itself as “precise and premium.”\n\nI posted about it on r/Caudabe this morning with photos, just explaining the problem and why it’s so disappointing. Within minutes Reddit displayed:  \n\n“Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Caudabe.”\n\nAlmost immediately after it was taken down, the official Caudabe account opened a private chat asking for my order number. As soon as I mentioned how fast my post was removed and that it looked like they were censoring negative experiences, the chat went completely silent, their account was shown as typing briefly, then never responded again.\n\nTo me, that’s not just bad quality control, it’s unethical brand behavior. Deleting valid customer experiences from their own subreddit to maintain an image doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nAt least when a company like Dbrand messes up, they own it publicly. They let their customers talk openly, fix the issue, and move on with integrity. Caudabe’s approach of silencing criticism while ghosting customers feels shady and erodes trust far more than a few defective cases ever could.\n\nJust a heads-up for anyone thinking about buying from them. Sometimes “minimalist” apparently means minimal accountability, too.",

I genuinely hoped it wouldn’t be another iPhone Mini, but this isn’t what I meant. Does this feel accurate for you, fellow Redditors? Is this one just going to be a slow burn or is it going to fizzle? And if so, why? The b-word is too much a low hanging fruit and they did introduce the MagSafe pack for those times when one really needs the extra juice. If anything I would expect the camera to be the trade-off that might be stopping people, especially those they were already on the iPhone Pro, which was the same price point last year. Especially like to hear from any people that went from a 15 or 16 Pro to the Air. What did you miss? Do you think it will be worth it long time or do you think you may end up trading in again next year? (Or sooner?) This is the first major change in design Apple has made in quite a while so it’s interesting times.\n\nAll I know for sure is I’m in a pretty iPhone heavy microcosm and I’m the kind of guy that notices other people’s devices, as I’m always half feeling the urge to upgrade. But I’ve yet to see *one* iPhone Air in the wild although I’ve seen multiple 17 Pro’s — can’t mistake that plateau and triple array — while I’d expected to see at a couple Airs though.\n\nIt’s also entirely possible that Apple anticipated the air itself might be a flash in the pan and it’s prepared to completely replace it with an “iPhone Fold” or “iPhone Ultra.” Although I expected next year’s lineup to be iPhone, iPhone Air 2, iPhone Ultra. Now I wonder…",

I’m wondering if this information is accurate. Additionally, I’m interested in knowing what other people have and if there are any differences between the retail-sold and replacement models. ",

    "selftext": "After 6 loyal years with my OnePlus 7Pro, the device finally gave up on me. It had been flawless all these years, but one random afternoon — mid doomscroll — it decided to retire. No drama, no warning it just switched off like, “That’s enough internet for one lifetime.” Just gone. \n\nThe local repair folks declared it a “CPU and RAM issue” — tech-speak for “it’s gone, bro.” Meanwhile, OnePlus customer support gave me the final nail in the coffin: “Your device has reached end of life. We don’t have spare parts anymore.”\n\nTranslation: We’ve moved on. You should too.\n\nAnd that’s when I knew it was time.\nEnter: the iPhone 17 🍏\n\nHonestly, this felt like the most obvious upgrade for me. I’d been waiting for Apple to bring ProMotion to the base models ever since I first experienced that silky 90Hz refresh rate on my OnePlus — and now that it’s here, it feels so worth the wait. The same screen as the iPhone 17 Pro, the bump in base storage, and that trademark Apple refinement — it feels like the first time in years the baseline model doesn’t feel “less than.” It’s smooth, fast, and feels complete.\n\nAnd then… there’s the Sage Green. 💚🤑\nI didn’t think a colour could make me fall in love with a phone, but this shade did it. It’s calm, clean, and has that understated premium vibe — not shouting for attention, just quietly flexing in good lighting. Easily one of Apple’s best colour choices in a long time.\n\nThe phone is ridiculously smooth. ProMotion makes scrolling feel like butter, the battery life’s solid, and the cameras finally feel flagship-level even without the “Pro” tag. It’s funny — my OnePlus 7 Pro was the first phone that made me care about displays. And now, six years later, it’s Apple’s screen that’s making me smile every time I unlock it.\n\nFeels like a full cycle shifting from iPhone for better screen and specs and now — back with that familiar iPhone feeling I missed the past 6 years with “Pro” level upgrades.\n\nSafe to say, the iPhone 17 is exactly what I wanted it to be. A proper upgrade, not just a newer phone.\n",

    "selftext": "Every year we argue about titanium vs aluminum, bezels, battery cycles, camera bumps, charging speeds, AI buzzwords, etc… and then we completely ignore the one feature Apple shipped in the last few years that actually changed how you use the phone in daily life. Dynamic Island wasn’t “new hardware”, it was a UX decision. Apple took a problem (the camera cutout) and turned it into UI real estate. Music controls, navigation, timers, live activities, authentication, calls, AirPods, it all lives there now. You don’t think about it, you just use it. And that’s the whole point: good design disappears into behavior.\n\nTake it away tomorrow and I guarantee most people would feel something is “missing” immediately. I can’t say the same about the Action Button or about most of the “new” things Apple ships lately.\n\nThe funniest part to me is that Android manufacturers copy Apple instantly when something is shallow (removing accessories, changing ports, renaming modes, etc), but after 3 years nobody even tried to copy the Dynamic Island. Not because they don’t want to, but because that kind of idea requires real integration between hardware and system UI, not just a checkbox feature.\n\nTo me, Dynamic Island is one of the most quietly brilliant Apple moves in years, and people treat it like a minor bullet point.\n\n",

    "selftext": "So I wanted to share a really disappointing experience with Caudabe today. I figured I’d change things up from the usual Dbrand case. What a mistake.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both got new iPhone Airs and ordered a pair of Caudabe Sheath cases directly from their site. Both arrived this morning, and both had quality issues right out of the box:\n\n•\tThe black Sheath was badly warped, and even came missing the unlock/sleep button, making it completely unusable.\n\n•\tThe green Sheath was also slightly warped and had green shavings around the camera cutout, just like leftover material on a rough 3D print.\n\n•\tThe packaging was undamaged, so this clearly happened before shipping.\n\nGiven Caudabe’s premium pricing, this kind of quality control issue is completely unacceptable. You’d expect something like this from a cheap $10 Amazon case, not from a brand that markets itself as “precise and premium.”\n\nI posted about it on r/Caudabe this morning with photos, just explaining the problem and why it’s so disappointing. Within minutes Reddit displayed:  \n\n“Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Caudabe.”\n\nAlmost immediately after it was taken down, the official Caudabe account opened a private chat asking for my order number. As soon as I mentioned how fast my post was removed and that it looked like they were censoring negative experiences, the chat went completely silent, their account was shown as typing briefly, then never responded again.\n\nTo me, that’s not just bad quality control, it’s unethical brand behavior. Deleting valid customer experiences from their own subreddit to maintain an image doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nAt least when a company like Dbrand messes up, they own it publicly. They let their customers talk openly, fix the issue, and move on with integrity. Caudabe’s approach of silencing criticism while ghosting customers feels shady and erodes trust far more than a few defective cases ever could.\n\nJust a heads-up for anyone thinking about buying from them. Sometimes “minimalist” apparently means minimal accountability, too.",

I genuinely hoped it wouldn’t be another iPhone Mini, but this isn’t what I meant. Does this feel accurate for you, fellow Redditors? Is this one just going to be a slow burn or is it going to fizzle? And if so, why? The b-word is too much a low hanging fruit and they did introduce the MagSafe pack for those times when one really needs the extra juice. If anything I would expect the camera to be the trade-off that might be stopping people, especially those they were already on the iPhone Pro, which was the same price point last year. Especially like to hear from any people that went from a 15 or 16 Pro to the Air. What did you miss? Do you think it will be worth it long time or do you think you may end up trading in again next year? (Or sooner?) This is the first major change in design Apple has made in quite a while so it’s interesting times.\n\nAll I know for sure is I’m in a pretty iPhone heavy microcosm and I’m the kind of guy that notices other people’s devices, as I’m always half feeling the urge to upgrade. But I’ve yet to see *one* iPhone Air in the wild although I’ve seen multiple 17 Pro’s — can’t mistake that plateau and triple array — while I’d expected to see at a couple Airs though.\n\nIt’s also entirely possible that Apple anticipated the air itself might be a flash in the pan and it’s prepared to completely replace it with an “iPhone Fold” or “iPhone Ultra.” Although I expected next year’s lineup to be iPhone, iPhone Air 2, iPhone Ultra. Now I wonder…",

I created an app that helps you to keep track of all your data in one simple place.\n\n# Download\n\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franko.privacyguard)\n\nI first released it 4 years ago, but Google removed it stating it violates the terms of use. Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

    "selftext": "I've never owned a galaxy S8 (used apple, oneplus, pixel, then my first samsung was my current s24 ultra), but I feel like it's the most influential Android phone in the last 10 years in terms of physical design. It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Has *anyone in the general public* actually received their Titan 2 yet?\n2. If yes, how’s it holding up — build quality, battery, keyboard feel, software stability, camera, etc.?\n3. Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

The phone suddenly stopped working overnight while charging normally.\n\nI sent it for repair through the official Google channel and received a diagnosis of “liquid damage”, with a repair quote of € 644.52 (out of warranty).\n\nHowever, the phone was never exposed to water. I asked Google Support for objective technical evidence (report, photos, LCI readings, methodology, technician ID, etc.), but they said they don’t have any documentation or photos, since the device was returned immediately after I declined the quote.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2019/771 (transposed in Portugal as Decree-Law 84/2021), sellers must provide technical proof when excluding warranty due to alleged misuse — otherwise, the fault is presumed to have existed at delivery.\n\nThe case was escalated to a “second-line” team three days ago, but I haven’t received any update.\n\nHas anyone in the EU experienced a similar situation with Google repairs? Were you able to get photos, a technical report, or have the decision overturned?\n\nI just want a transparent and evidence-based assessment — nothing more, nothing less.",

I created an app that helps you to keep track of all your data in one simple place.\n\n# Download\n\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franko.privacyguard)\n\nI first released it 4 years ago, but Google removed it stating it violates the terms of use. Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Recently, I was searching for flip phone reviews and saw an article on the Vertu website. The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

AVEZ does allow this however when I go to send an image over social media it doesn't give me the option to use AVEZ, therefore I cannot navigate to the desired group and album which I require. I need this option as part of my business as I create a business album, then sort each clients pictures into their own album within the business grouping. \n\nPs I have tried settings-apps-default apps but it doesn't give an option for gallery. I also do not want to disable Google photos as I like it for backing up photos. \n\nThanks for any help",

    "selftext": "I visited F1 Service (1mg mall) in Bengaluru to get my swollen battery replaced. It was a global issue, and Google offered the replacement free of charge. Unfortunately, my screen had a crack in the upper corner, and as per their policy, they had to replace it. So I had to pay INR 7249. Got it in 4 hours. They urged a five-star review, and that's fine.\n\nWithin 3 weeks, the screen started going black in the area where the fingerprint sensor is. I took it to the store and they agreed as it was <90 days for a free replacement. \n\nAfter a while, they opened it and they said they found water inside the phone. I casually mentioned, it must have been the rain. They charged me another INR 850 for an investigation, and they came back with a back panel and droplets in a specific area. Not trying to accuse them, but it did look fresh. Not sure any phone can handle that. \n\nUltimately rejected the warranty and said it'll cost me INR 26K for a new display, motherboard, camera and battery, so maybe get a new phone. I asked the lady, but how is the time being shown if the motherboard is gone? She said it's temporary and it'll stop working soon.\n\n  \nIt's been more than 10 days since this incident, and my phone works perfectly well apart from the display. I am using Google Talkback and Google Assistant, and it works just as normal (Alarms, calls, messages). Had to use a USB keyboard to unlock after switching on, else it unlocks via face. All with a blank display. I have important data and banking apps in there.\n\nTried writing to the Google service, but they don't care. Scripted emails about how they are \"actively investigating\" for more than a week.\n\n  \nWhat are my options here? Have any of you faced any similar situations? \n\n  \nPS: Even tried casting the phone using an HDMI cable, unfortunately, it's available from Pixel 8 series. ",

I've found in the past I do quite a bit of shadows adjustment as the Pixel, especially earlier versions likes to crush shadows. But this past weekend I was taking photos and using muscle memory to adjust what I thought was the shadow slider, I noticed either minimal impact on the shadow regions or the overall image was getting too bright.\n\nThen as I stared at those icons they looked strange to me, as if they were flipped. I pulled out my Pixel 9 Pro (still on Camera 9.9) and compared... yup. They flipped the sliders. That's moderately annoying considering most people probably don't study the brightness/shadows icons that well and a surprise change like this can result in a very frustrating experience if you're used to these sliders from years ago.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/nakHWuh.png",

    "selftext": "​Hi team, I'm facing a big dilemma. In France, Amazon is offering interesting trade-in bonuses for Pixels. It's a phone that has always appealed to me. However, I'm not at all unhappy with my Honor 200 (fast charging, great battery, quality Harcourt-style portrait photos). I do, however, have the feeling that if I don't sell my Honor 200 now, it will be difficult to sell later. Amazon is offering me 208 euros for the trade-in (it cost me 172 euros 6 months ago with a 70 euro trade-in of my old phone, so 242 euros if I estimate the total value).\n​In short, I can get the 9a for 226 euros and the 9 for 356 euros (which is 130 euros more than the 9a).\n\n​What is important for me is:\n\n- ​Fluidity (Smoothness/Responsiveness)\n- ​Being able to run everything without bugs\n- ​Photography\n- ​Battery life\n\n​Please help me with this choice! Thanks 😊",

No matter how many times I try to turn them on, they immediately turn off again by themselves.\n\nIt’s super frustrating — I’ve tried everything I could think of:\n\n* Restarted the phone → didn’t work\n* Reset network settings → no luck\n* Restarted Bluetooth and Wi-Fi → still nothing\n* Even did a full factory reset → problem still there\n\nTook it to a technician, and he said it *might* be a loose connection on the board that controls Wi-Fi/Bluetooth. But after opening it up, everything looked totally fine, no physical issues.\n\nSo now I’m stuck. No clue what to do next. For now, I guess I’ll just wait for the next monthly update (the one they usually drop on the first Monday of the month) and hope that somehow fixes it.\n\nReally sucks to have paid this much for a phone and end up dealing with stuff like this. It shouldn't be happening.\n\nAny ideas?",

Adjusting the brightness scale will only change the hue where \"dimmest\" setting is teal and \"brightess\" setting is red and the middle is neutral. u/Raychii took a video of the exact issue. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1k8s7qh/intermittent_screen_discolouration_on_pixel_9_pro/mp8pghn/ When this happens, the always on display will not work either. The full brightness in a dark room burns my eyes when I try to use my phone.\n\nI tolerated it this long because I used to be able to \"force\" the autobrightness to work by adjusting the brightness scale to the middle two times in a row. It would finally adjust the brightness and the always on display would work.\n\nBut that would stop working again when I put my phone in my pocket and walked around. The brightness would be 100% again with the same issues described above.\n\nLately, some new update disabled that workaround. The phone has a mind of its own when I can adjust the brightness. You cannot imagine my frustration of wanting to throw the phone against the wall when it's on 100% brightness all the time. I might end up trading the phone and going back to Samsung if I can't find a fix.",

Come to find out it was none of these (in my case). I finally decided to just disable 5gUW, turned on wifi, turned off doze stopper, and reenabled all the optimisation settings just for the hell of it and wouldn't you know it, I got all my notifications without a hitch. No delay, and every notification told me what exactly it was notifying me of. \n\nWhen I was on IOS I never had this issue, and this is a really big bummer for me cause I switched to pixel because I wanted to try out android since it's been so long and the pixel felt like the most iphone feeling android device so it made switching easier. Sadly tho, I'm more of a first impressions kind of guy so I'm probably going back to IOS after dealing with this headache for almost 2 months. Now I only use 5gUW if I can't get wifi signal anywhere which blows cause now a feature I pay for is severely hindered.",

    "selftext": "Context: I live in Germany and Google support has offered me the option to send me a replacement device for my month old Pixel 9 due to potential OLED image retention/burn-in issues (anyone else with this issue?)\n\nWas wondering if anyone has experience RMA-ing Pixels in Germany, because I have a few questions:\n\n1. Do they reject your RMA claims even for the slightest cosmetic damage? (My phone has a single minor hairline scratch on the screen and based on the other stories about RMA in the EU, I'm worried I'm going to have to go without a phone for 2 weeks only for my claim to get rejected and I cannot afford to go without a phone for so long)\n\n\n2. Does it actually take 5-10 business days as Google says, or is it longer? Does the phone get shipped to Poland?\n\n\n3. Do they always only send refurbished replacements or do they send new ones sometimes too? (One support agent told me the device will be brand new, the other one wasn't so clear, but I don't think I can rely on their word because based on other stories in this sub, there seems to be no consistency b/w their support agents and what their actual RMA/repair partner in Europe does, let alone among their own support agents itself)\n\n\nI was also told by Google support that I could get my phone repaired at Comspot (Google's authorized repair partner in Germany). They offer walk-in same-day repairs. My only gripe with this is repairing the phone instead of replacing it may void the water resistance rating, which is a real shame for a phone that's only a month old.\n\n\nWhat do y'all think? Should I risk RMA-ing it, or wait it out, see how the burn-in situation goes and based on that just go to the repair center (Comspot)?",

Although it gets a bit hot when using it for charging.  \n\nHaving owned the P2, P4XL, P6 Pro and P8 Pro, it's Google's best phone to date in my opinion.  \n\nI'm tired of always having the faster processor out there, the phone works great and feels snappy.  The P8 pro still feel great too by the way.  I'm really glad google doesn't follow Apple's moto of getting the fastest chip out there, it's just not needed.  The experience on the pixel is great and that's what matters.\n\n  \nThe only negative with google is their naming convention :)\n\nFeel free to ask questions.  \n\n",

    "title": "A Post About Disappointment – My First Flagship Phone (Pixel 10 Pro)",
    "selftext": "This is not a hate post. It’s something way more sad in my opinion. It’s a **disappointment post**. But let me start from the beginning.\n\nI've never had a **flagship phone**, mostly because they were simply too expensive to afford. But I've always been a phone geek, checking new models, new features, and watching countless reviews and comparisons on YouTube. In my life, I've had many phones from different brands, but as I said, never a flagship. And the phone I always craved the most, the one that always got my attention, was the **Google Pixel**.\n\nThe year 2025 came, and I decided this was the moment. Two months after my 33rd birthday, I bought the **Pixel 10 Pro** on the day it premiered. I can’t describe the emotions and dopamine rush I got in that moment. There, in a few days, I was going to own the newest flagship, the pinnacle of technology. Fast forward one month, and that's why I'm writing this post.\n\nI've used the Pixel for over a month, and on a daily basis, I can’t say anything bad about the phone. It looks fantastic, the build quality feels good, and I like the camera and overall performance in daily usage (I'm not a benchmark guy, nor do I do a lot of mobile gaming). However, there are some things that truly made me disappointed after so many years of craving a Google flagship phone.\n\nTo not make this already long post any longer, I’m going to list the things that, in my opinion, are **unacceptable**:\n\n**1.** I know this is a new standard, but I don’t like it, and I’m going to say it loud. Buying a phone for 1370 EUR / $1590 (the 512GB version, price from my country) where you don’t even get a **charger** really feels like a rip-off (i know all brands does it).\n\n**2.** After a month of using it, I discovered there are some **noises coming from the Pixel**. My first thought: \"Oh my god, it's broken.\" I was devastated. You should have seen my face when I discovered the whole **\"rattle gate\"** issue. I mean, your phone sounding like something is broken inside whenever you move it faster gives a terrible experience. Even though it doesn't affect performance, this is not what I was expecting from a flagship for that much money. Big disappointment. Guess you can get used to it though.\n\n**3.** In my one+ month of using the Pixel 10 Pro, I had about **3 separate occasions in which I was unable to make a call**. Just like that. I don't have 2G connection blocked or anything like that. I wanted to call someone, but it never actually started dialing. The problem disappeared only after a **phone reset**.\n\nIn my two-year experience with a $200 Redmi, I never once had such a case. Do I need to tell you how disappointing this is? It's actually a big problem. What if the call I'll be making is very important, or time is crucial? \"Oh sorry, this time you can't call, reset your phone.\" This actually gives me anxiety each time I'm calling now because i don't know if i'll be able to. After investigating a bit, I encountered a lot of posts and articles about problems with the modem/GSM module (sorry if thats not it, not really a technical guy) in Pixel phones. So, it's not something new either. Calling is a basic feature of phones, and now the Pixel is failing in this as well?\n\n**4.** Last but not least, I became a Google Pixel fan mostly because of their **\"pure Android experience\"**—the whole \"you can customize what you want,\" etc. But it turns out, you can't even customize the main screen! The Google search bar is **unremovable**, as is the date/calendar add-on. They *have* to be there. Quite a small choice for a \"customize everything phone.\" Same goes for function buttons, you can't swap the order. I mean c'mon google.\n\nWith the date add-on(or widget - not really sure how to call it), I'm also actually getting a **bug** where sometimes it disappears, but when I click the place on the screen where it's supposed to be, the calendar opens. After restarting the phone, I see the widget again. So, that’s another weird thing.\n\nI don't want this to be another hate post. Before buying this phone I was the biggest Pixel fanboy ever. I really do like this phone despite all the issues. This is just the perspective of someone who got his first flagship in 2025, from a company he always thought was the best in the business. And I’m just **disappointed**.",

It doesn't work with the \"one hand\" keyboard view either.\n\nTo close the keyboard I need to swipe left in a place above the keyboard or use the down arrow.

Before this I had a 6 Pro, 4 XL, 2 XL and didn't have any issues with those. In fact, it felt like my 6 Pro was taking better astrophotography photos than my current 10 Pro XL. I've tried setting the focus to far or leaving it on auto and waiting a few seconds for it to focus. However, each time the photos are out of focus. If you zoom in you can clearly see that the stars are circles and the photo seems less clear than my 6 Pro. Regular photos with my 10 seem to be in perfect focus to me.\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/astro-photos-3x8NpJQ",

AVEZ does allow this however when I go to send an image over social media it doesn't give me the option to use AVEZ, therefore I cannot navigate to the desired group and album which I require. I need this option as part of my business as I create a business album, then sort each clients pictures into their own album within the business grouping. \n\nPs I have tried settings-apps-default apps but it doesn't give an option for gallery. I also do not want to disable Google photos as I like it for backing up photos. \n\nThanks for any help",

    "selftext": "I visited F1 Service (1mg mall) in Bengaluru to get my swollen battery replaced. It was a global issue, and Google offered the replacement free of charge. Unfortunately, my screen had a crack in the upper corner, and as per their policy, they had to replace it. So I had to pay INR 7249. Got it in 4 hours. They urged a five-star review, and that's fine.\n\nWithin 3 weeks, the screen started going black in the area where the fingerprint sensor is. I took it to the store and they agreed as it was <90 days for a free replacement. \n\nAfter a while, they opened it and they said they found water inside the phone. I casually mentioned, it must have been the rain. They charged me another INR 850 for an investigation, and they came back with a back panel and droplets in a specific area. Not trying to accuse them, but it did look fresh. Not sure any phone can handle that. \n\nUltimately rejected the warranty and said it'll cost me INR 26K for a new display, motherboard, camera and battery, so maybe get a new phone. I asked the lady, but how is the time being shown if the motherboard is gone? She said it's temporary and it'll stop working soon.\n\n  \nIt's been more than 10 days since this incident, and my phone works perfectly well apart from the display. I am using Google Talkback and Google Assistant, and it works just as normal (Alarms, calls, messages). Had to use a USB keyboard to unlock after switching on, else it unlocks via face. All with a blank display. I have important data and banking apps in there.\n\nTried writing to the Google service, but they don't care. Scripted emails about how they are \"actively investigating\" for more than a week.\n\n  \nWhat are my options here? Have any of you faced any similar situations? \n\n  \nPS: Even tried casting the phone using an HDMI cable, unfortunately, it's available from Pixel 8 series. ",

Although it gets a bit hot when using it for charging.  \n\nHaving owned the P2, P4XL, P6 Pro and P8 Pro, it's Google's best phone to date in my opinion.  \n\nI'm tired of always having the faster processor out there, the phone works great and feels snappy.  The P8 pro still feel great too by the way.  I'm really glad google doesn't follow Apple's moto of getting the fastest chip out there, it's just not needed.  The experience on the pixel is great and that's what matters.\n\n  \nThe only negative with google is their naming convention :)\n\nFeel free to ask questions.  \n\n",

I've found in the past I do quite a bit of shadows adjustment as the Pixel, especially earlier versions likes to crush shadows. But this past weekend I was taking photos and using muscle memory to adjust what I thought was the shadow slider, I noticed either minimal impact on the shadow regions or the overall image was getting too bright.\n\nThen as I stared at those icons they looked strange to me, as if they were flipped. I pulled out my Pixel 9 Pro (still on Camera 9.9) and compared... yup. They flipped the sliders. That's moderately annoying considering most people probably don't study the brightness/shadows icons that well and a surprise change like this can result in a very frustrating experience if you're used to these sliders from years ago.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/nakHWuh.png",

Come to find out it was none of these (in my case). I finally decided to just disable 5gUW, turned on wifi, turned off doze stopper, and reenabled all the optimisation settings just for the hell of it and wouldn't you know it, I got all my notifications without a hitch. No delay, and every notification told me what exactly it was notifying me of. \n\nWhen I was on IOS I never had this issue, and this is a really big bummer for me cause I switched to pixel because I wanted to try out android since it's been so long and the pixel felt like the most iphone feeling android device so it made switching easier. Sadly tho, I'm more of a first impressions kind of guy so I'm probably going back to IOS after dealing with this headache for almost 2 months. Now I only use 5gUW if I can't get wifi signal anywhere which blows cause now a feature I pay for is severely hindered.",

Adjusting the brightness scale will only change the hue where \"dimmest\" setting is teal and \"brightess\" setting is red and the middle is neutral. u/Raychii took a video of the exact issue. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1k8s7qh/intermittent_screen_discolouration_on_pixel_9_pro/mp8pghn/ When this happens, the always on display will not work either. The full brightness in a dark room burns my eyes when I try to use my phone.\n\nI tolerated it this long because I used to be able to \"force\" the autobrightness to work by adjusting the brightness scale to the middle two times in a row. It would finally adjust the brightness and the always on display would work.\n\nBut that would stop working again when I put my phone in my pocket and walked around. The brightness would be 100% again with the same issues described above.\n\nLately, some new update disabled that workaround. The phone has a mind of its own when I can adjust the brightness. You cannot imagine my frustration of wanting to throw the phone against the wall when it's on 100% brightness all the time. I might end up trading the phone and going back to Samsung if I can't find a fix.",

    "selftext": "Context: I live in Germany and Google support has offered me the option to send me a replacement device for my month old Pixel 9 due to potential OLED image retention/burn-in issues (anyone else with this issue?)\n\nWas wondering if anyone has experience RMA-ing Pixels in Germany, because I have a few questions:\n\n1. Do they reject your RMA claims even for the slightest cosmetic damage? (My phone has a single minor hairline scratch on the screen and based on the other stories about RMA in the EU, I'm worried I'm going to have to go without a phone for 2 weeks only for my claim to get rejected and I cannot afford to go without a phone for so long)\n\n\n2. Does it actually take 5-10 business days as Google says, or is it longer? Does the phone get shipped to Poland?\n\n\n3. Do they always only send refurbished replacements or do they send new ones sometimes too? (One support agent told me the device will be brand new, the other one wasn't so clear, but I don't think I can rely on their word because based on other stories in this sub, there seems to be no consistency b/w their support agents and what their actual RMA/repair partner in Europe does, let alone among their own support agents itself)\n\n\nI was also told by Google support that I could get my phone repaired at Comspot (Google's authorized repair partner in Germany). They offer walk-in same-day repairs. My only gripe with this is repairing the phone instead of replacing it may void the water resistance rating, which is a real shame for a phone that's only a month old.\n\n\nWhat do y'all think? Should I risk RMA-ing it, or wait it out, see how the burn-in situation goes and based on that just go to the repair center (Comspot)?",

Around May I started thinking about replacing it for an upcoming holiday.\n\nSeptember arrives and the battery goes from mediocre to lasting 2 hours max.\n\nThankfully due to this sub I found out it's a known problem so got £300 store credit. Birthday thing was coming round so I was looking forward to double discount but alas not. Anyway I get a Pixel 9 for a decent price.\n\nSetup and transfer from the old one suvks. With Apple it takes 30 mins and just works. With Google it installedy apps but that's about it.\n\nAnyway a few weeks later some observations:\n\n1. Battery is v good. A day in Disney and it's still at 50%. You need to use the park app a lot. \n\n2. Biometrics are awesome. Soooo much faster and reliable.\n\n3. Camera is great. I want an easy point and shoot with good quality results. This is it. Portrait mode rocks.\n\nHope that helps someone! Peace.",

Unfortunately, my screen had a crack in the upper corner, and as per their policy, they had to replace it. So I had to pay INR 7249. Got it in 4 hours. They urged a five-star review, and that's fine.\n\nWithin 3 weeks, the screen started going black in the area where the fingerprint sensor is. I took it to the store and they agreed as it was <90 days for a free replacement. \n\nAfter a while, they opened it and they said they found water inside the phone. I casually mentioned, it must have been the rain. They charged me another INR 850 for an investigation, and they came back with a back panel and droplets in a specific area. Not trying to accuse them, but it did look fresh. Not sure any phone can handle that. \n\nUltimately rejected the warranty and said it'll cost me INR 26K for a new display, motherboard, camera and battery, so maybe get a new phone. I asked the lady, but how is the time being shown if the motherboard is gone? She said it's temporary and it'll stop working soon.\n\n  \nIt's been more than 10 days since this incident, and my phone works perfectly well apart from the display. I am using Google Talkback and Google Assistant, and it works just as normal (Alarms, calls, messages). Had to use a USB keyboard to unlock after switching on, else it unlocks via face. All with a blank display. I have important data and banking apps in there.\n\nTried writing to the Google service, but they don't care. Scripted emails about how they are \"actively investigating\" for more than a week.\n\n  \nWhat are my options here? Have any of you faced any similar situations? \n\n  \nPS: Even tried casting the phone using an HDMI cable, unfortunately, it's available from Pixel 8 series. ",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "title": "My Unlocked S25 Ultra from BestBuy Disabled After 6 Months",
    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

    "selftext": "My experience with [samsung.com](http://samsung.com/) was awful. I preordered the Z Flip 7 the 20th of july, while there was the promotion of the free galaxy buds pro 3 while giving my Z Flip 6 for trade in, so i ended up paying around 380€ for the phone, earbuds and galaxy Watch 8 Classic.\n\nIt's been a month and a half, the site said it would've been sent by the 4th of August but still my order is \"pending\" on their site with no update since they got my money on july 20th. I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

I eventually switched to iPhone with the 12 Pro, and 5 years later it still feels just as smooth as the day I got it.\n\nNow I’m considering going back to Android with the S26, but I don’t want to deal with the same old performance issues if Samsung hasn’t really fixed this.\n\nFor those of you who’ve stuck with Samsung in recent years, how does long-term performance hold up? Are they still prone to slowing down or is it finally on par with iOS for longevity?",

But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

    "selftext": "How is it that 7 generations in, Samsung hasn't figured out just how incredibly annoying it is for the camera array to be vertical?  My one singular complaint about the 7 (I don't even care about the cost at this point because you know what you're getting) is the fact that you can't set it down on a table and not have it rock awkwardly.  The pixel figured this out a long time ago.  Is there some weird licensing thing that stops Samsung from making an obvious design choice?  Are they just that desperate to sell cases?  For the life of me, I can't see the upside to configuring it the way that they do.",

If you’re an engineer that worked on this product - thank you!\n\n1. Loads a bunch of wash fluids (detergent & such). Back saver. \n2. I just set and forget. Literally can get a load done overnight!! Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. \n3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. \n4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don’t have to do that anymore. \n5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.\n\nQuirks\n- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed. I would like to have a simple play button (which would do AI wash) for my parents and my young daughter who I’m going to start to train to load and start. ",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

How much longer are we going to deal with the constant \"making things worse\" to justify the investment in LLMs? I'm tired of this nonsense. It's bad enough Uncle Terry opens a meta product on his phone and gets brainwashed by technocrats but now they want the lying machine persistently on people's lock screen? Really? ",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I’ve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "to make a long story short, i work at a computer repair shop, and we often have people come in with cellphones, which we almost always direct over to the local cellphone repair shop. we have an agreement that if we get a cellphone repair request we send them to their shop, and if they get a laptop repair request they send them to our shop\n\nbut with the issues where people are having with samsung galaxy ring batteries swelling, im not sure if i should send them to the cellphone repair shop, or the hospital.\n\nthis isnt a joke meme post, ive just heard that hospitals have a hard time removing the rings because of the nature of the battery in the ring meaning the ring cant just be cut off in the normal way they would a stuck ring, so im really not sure what to do in that situation\n\ni dont have anything much aganst samsung, asside from the annoyance of apps with the appliances my landlord has recently installed in our apartment (im not a fan of needing an app to access all the features of my stove) cause samsung phones are not bad, not the best option in my opinion but if you have the money to spend they are the apple of the android world and so i get it.",

And while we're at it, I also want to remove some of those complications and add a digital clock instead. Are these modifications possible? \n\nMaybe via WatchFace studio or some other app or program? Or do I have to create the entire watchface from scratch? \n\nAny suggestions will be helpful. Thanks!",

I want something that feels premium, lasts a few years, and doesn’t make me feel like I have to upgrade every time Samsung releases a new one. Basically, something that’s good enough to keep and forget about the hype cycle.\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking:\n\n* **Watch 4 Classic** – budget-friendly, but maybe too dated now?\n* **Watch 6 Classic** – seems like the sweet spot for value and performance.\n* **Watch 8 Classic** – newer, but not sure if the price jump is worth it.\n\nFor anyone rocking a Fold + Watch combo:  \nWhich Classic model do you think hits the best balance between **price, features, and longevity**?  \nI’m aiming for that “buy it once and chill” kind of setup.

    "selftext": "I don't know if this has been discussed already so I'm sorry if this is redundant or if someone else has already said this. If you are having an issue when your Galaxy watch goes into a sleep mode where the always on display and raise to wake are being turned off and not turned back on when you wake up, this is for you. Go into your modes and routines and just toggle those settings off in the sleep mode. I know that this is not ideal if you want it to turn on and off automatically however I don't think that having these things on while sleeping really affects wearing the watch much. ",

Main thing I have seen is the new faces, especially as they can show stress and oxygen which I didn't find as a complication in previous faces. Albeit the stress reading was accurate before (ok I only got the watch on Friday) still, since today it's all over the place and as I am lounging at home that doesn't make much sense. I tested it with my old Huawei watch that says I am cool as a cucumber with it, while gw7 on the other arm says I am highly stressed (lol I am not, I should know, I have a masters in psychology lol). Really the only things that would have made this interesting are the vascular load and the anti oxidant index which are not included. All that hype for so little... Oh and still abysmal support if you are a tennis player, disappointing ",

Can’t wait to see if it motivates me or just roasts me for my “brisk walking” pace.\n\nBut seriously, can someone explain why some of these new features aren’t available on the other Galaxy Watches?\nSame sensors, same everything — but nope, Samsung said “you can look, but you can’t touch.”\n\nHaving Facer back is great though. I’ve already changed my watch face three times today because apparently commitment isn’t my thing.\n\nAlso, the grouped notifications — chef’s kiss. Finally, my wrist doesn’t look like it’s having a notification panic attack.\n\nOverall, One UI 8 feels like a solid glow-up. Just wish Samsung didn’t sprinkle in that classic “you can’t have this yet” energy.",

The other 2 moderators have been inactive for a few months, so I’ve taken over the role as top moderator for the community. I’ve been doing some spring cleaning and updates, with the biggest changes being:\n\n\n\n* The rules list is much clearer and more detailed\n* The rule on Watch Face Posts is now:\n   * Pictures of real watches are allowed, but advertisements are not.\n   * See the included image as an example\n\n\n\nSome other smaller changes:\n\n\n\n* More “Similar Communities” subreddits are on the sidebar\n* Flairs have been cleaned up slightly and might be combined in the future.\n* The backlog of unprocessed rule violation reports has been actioned and cleared\n   * If your post or comment was accidentally removed, let me know!\n* A comment sticky has been created clarifying the new Watch Face Post rule\n\n\n\nWe will be doing a call for moderators in the future.

I want something that feels premium, lasts a few years, and doesn’t make me feel like I have to upgrade every time Samsung releases a new one. Basically, something that’s good enough to keep and forget about the hype cycle.\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking:\n\n* **Watch 4 Classic** – budget-friendly, but maybe too dated now?\n* **Watch 6 Classic** – seems like the sweet spot for value and performance.\n* **Watch 8 Classic** – newer, but not sure if the price jump is worth it.\n\nFor anyone rocking a Fold + Watch combo:  \nWhich Classic model do you think hits the best balance between **price, features, and longevity**?  \nI’m aiming for that “buy it once and chill” kind of setup.

When I first set it up, the weather app could not access my location despite having all permissions. \n\nTo fix it, I reverted the galaxy wearable app to a previous version. This fixed the weather app but locked me out of the Galaxy Wearable app, as it constantly told me to update, preventing me from using it. \n\nAfter a month or so, the weather app was fixed with a new update, so I updated my app. Everything was fine for some weeks, and then the OS8 update came. \n\nI downloaded OS8, and it is overall good in my opinion, BUT NOW THE WEATHER APP IS BROKEN AGAIN??????????\n\nWhy can't it just \\*work\\*.

Loving it a lot and exploring the frankly _wayy_ too many features it has.\n\nIronically I actually like the default WF of the 8 classic far more than the one that is on the Ultra, except I also like that ring of compass around it.\n\nIs there any way for me to _add_ that thing to the \"Sporty Classic\" Watchface? And while we're at it, I also want to remove some of those complications and add a digital clock instead. Are these modifications possible? \n\nMaybe via WatchFace studio or some other app or program? Or do I have to create the entire watchface from scratch? \n\nAny suggestions will be helpful. Thanks!",

They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea.

It downloads, tries to install, and then just gives me the generic \"try again later\" notification.\n\nI've already tried the usual troubleshooting steps:\n\n* Restarting both my phone and the watch.\n* Ensuring a stable Wi-Fi connection for both devices.\n* I even did a full factory reset of the watch.\n\nNothing has worked so far.\n\nIs anyone else facing this problem with their GW7? Or more importantly, has anyone found a fix or a workaround to get the update to install properly?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nEDIT: VPN was the Problem.

I want something that feels premium, lasts a few years, and doesn’t make me feel like I have to upgrade every time Samsung releases a new one. Basically, something that’s good enough to keep and forget about the hype cycle.\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking:\n\n* **Watch 4 Classic** – budget-friendly, but maybe too dated now?\n* **Watch 6 Classic** – seems like the sweet spot for value and performance.\n* **Watch 8 Classic** – newer, but not sure if the price jump is worth it.\n\nFor anyone rocking a Fold + Watch combo:  \nWhich Classic model do you think hits the best balance between **price, features, and longevity**?  \nI’m aiming for that “buy it once and chill” kind of setup.

During a Windows reinstall it charged up to 11%, then after switching Windows power mode from Battery Saver to Best Performance it stopped charging again. After windows got reinstalled for a few minutes before changing the power setting it was charging even though the charging icon was not displayed in the corner. After changing it back to power saving it wouldn't charge again.\n\n**What I’ve tried:**\n\n* Original OEM charger.\n* Brand-new OEM charger.\n* BIOS has no charging options on this model.\n\n**Context:**  \nThe first DIY jack worked for a while but later failed because the solder job wasn’t solid. I replaced the jack again at a service center. Since then I get the low-wattage warning even with OEM chargers. I have tried discharging the laptop several times.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Why would the system flag “lower wattage” with genuine chargers after a DC-in jack replacement?\n2. Is this likely an ID/sense pin or cable issue on the DC-in board, a missing resistor, or EC/firmware problem?\n3. Any safe way to bypass the warning so it charges normally?\n4. What should I check or replace next (DC-in board/cable, battery, EC reset, CMOS reset, etc.)?\n\nAny guidance or known fixes for this 2019 Legion Y7000 would help.",

My laptop is not very expensive but it is a really great one at a good price (reduced). I do CS so you can imagine how many heavy programs it had to go thru 247 day in and out. It is still fast and works without problem and I am completely satisfied with it thru out the years, some internal problems were fixed thru warranty tho. Anyways I didn't think about changing it at all. \n\nWith that being said the battery life was actually getting bad, it gets hot quite fast and the mousepad doesn't work well. It is not a perfect laptop in general. Not only that I am going to start grad school in januray hopefully so I am still gonna use it intensively so I feel like now would be the oppertunity to replace it. I am looking to spend at least $700 to find anything close to it. So which decision sounds better?",

    "title": "7 years and a grey halo: A tribute to my old laptop",
    "selftext": "*Kindly forgive my English, I am not an English native speaker*\n## Introduction\nAfter a seven 7 years of usage my laptop - Asus zenbook UX410 - showed a grey halo surrounding the center of the display. The machine has been with me since I was in college, bought it when I had little money but still want to do some gaming. Many years passed and so much joy was given but this laptop. This is not a rant/complain but rather a farewell to a good friends and appreciation for the good time.\n\n## The beginning of a journey - The honeymoon phase\nIt was my 2nd year of college when my 150 USD laptop decided to give up all its ports. My father took me to the computer store for a new machine. I was so excited, finally I could get a machine to play some offline games that I had dreamed about for so long. \n\nTook this machine out of the store for its price and spec at that time. It came with a NVIDIA MX 550 graphic card. Never had a laptop so sleek before, the screen was gorgeous, my joy was through the roof!\n\n## Through Thick and Thin\n\nInstalled Assassin Creed 2, Ghost recon: Future soldier. Not the smoothest but very playable. My dream came true. Watched a movie, played some games, and the laptop was perfect. I was so happy. The screen was nice, It amazed me and my friends. The laptop did not scream at me like my old gaming machine and the heat was manageable. \n\nAll schoolwork and projects became more exciting. The slides were smooth (I was working with some heavy presentations with all the animation, even the professor was impressed with my slides) thanks to this machine, I had not been able to do this before. I wrote my entire thesis and multiples reports with this machine. Even took it to court to write my a live report. The battery was okay, not as much as my Intel Atom powered laptop, but with much more capabilities. It withstood 4 years of use with no fuse. \n\nAfter my graduation, It kept giving, multiple job searches, online interview. And company researches. Always a partner that I turned to whenever I need a pay raise (haha). It went through multiple jobs with me, showed me how useful it is to have a personal computer at hand (*most of my friends does not have a personal laptop, they ended up \"utilizing\" their work laptops - which is highly NOT recommended*)\n\nSounded a bit silly, but all the foundation of my tech knowledge came from this machine. What kind of browser used the least resources but still meet my needs, how to jailbreak an Android phones. Some tech tips, how I can re-use drives from old computers. \n\nFor it last year with me, I decided to try Linux on it. Started with Mint, then Ubuntu, then Pop!_OS. It was a bit of a challenge, but it was worth it. The battery was not as good as before, but it was still manageable. I stopped at Mint and again this machine opened my mind to the world of Linux. Still trying to help me until it last days. I learned a lot (*Linux wasn't that easy for someone who doesn't work in IT).\n\nThe chassis suffered from the heat (may be the CPU heating paste got dried), but it was still manageable. Even the rubber ring around the display degraded, black pieces fallen off. The palmrest was also showing black marks - a sign of oxidation. But it still worked fine until one day...\n\n## The end of a journey - The breakup phase\n\nIt was an after-work night as usual, I opened it to watch do some browsing. The screen showed a grey halo surrounding the center of the display. I was so sad, but I knew it was time to say goodbye. I closed it and put it away. At that point it had pretty much served me beyond my expectation.\n\nI visited a local refurbish store to get me a new laptop.\n\n## Farewell\n\nThank you Asus zenbook UX410, it was a great 7 years. You were the best I could have asked for.\n\n*Farewell, old friend. Enjoy your well-deserved rest.*\n\nP/S: It was so said that Asus now is plagued with bad reputation even my friend's machine encountered problems right after warranty period. Just want to write this to share that Asus was once capable of making a good laptop. ",

    "selftext": "I have a Lenovo ideapad Gaming 3-15ACH6 laptop with an RTX 3050Ti graphic card. \nI recently changed my Windows (installed Windows 11 build 23H2) and in the display information, I noticed that Windows is showing me that the bit depth is 10 bits. However, my laptop does not have a 10-bit display and is SDR (8 bits). I updated the AMD and Nvidia graphics card drivers and even downgraded them to previous versions, but it still shows the bit depth as 10 bits.\nI personally suspect that this is a problem with the AMD graphic card driver. Unfortunately, I did not find any option to change the bit depth. Does anyone have a solution to change the bit depth to 8 bits or is this just a bug that is showing the bit depth as 10 bits?",

I’m not sure what common sizes are)\n- Good looking screen with nice refresh rate (120hz - 144hz if that isn’t outrageous to ask for) - above 1080p if possible with that refresh rate\n- Black, as in black body or has compatible cases that are black\nI won’t be editing or gaming or anything fancy like that, just writing, looking things up, and occasionally watching YouTube or a show.\nThank you very much, apologies if these are unreasonable requests.",

What should I do during the first setup?\n\n\n2. Which options should I turn on or off (like privacy settings, updates, Lenovo apps, etc.)?\n\n\n3. Should I connect to Wi-Fi and update everything first, and then create a restore point or backup?\n\n OR\n\n\n4. Should I skip connecting to Wi-Fi, create a restore point first, and then update later?\n\n\n\nBasically, I just want to avoid messing things up and set it up properly from the start.\nAny setup tips or must-do steps would be awesome.\n\nThanks in advance! 🙏",

It is still fast and works without problem and I am completely satisfied with it thru out the years, some internal problems were fixed thru warranty tho. Anyways I didn't think about changing it at all. \n\nWith that being said the battery life was actually getting bad, it gets hot quite fast and the mousepad doesn't work well. It is not a perfect laptop in general. Not only that I am going to start grad school in januray hopefully so I am still gonna use it intensively so I feel like now would be the oppertunity to replace it. I am looking to spend at least $700 to find anything close to it. So which decision sounds better?",

During a Windows reinstall it charged up to 11%, then after switching Windows power mode from Battery Saver to Best Performance it stopped charging again. After windows got reinstalled for a few minutes before changing the power setting it was charging even though the charging icon was not displayed in the corner. After changing it back to power saving it wouldn't charge again.\n\n**What I’ve tried:**\n\n* Original OEM charger.\n* Brand-new OEM charger.\n* BIOS has no charging options on this model.\n\n**Context:**  \nThe first DIY jack worked for a while but later failed because the solder job wasn’t solid. I replaced the jack again at a service center. Since then I get the low-wattage warning even with OEM chargers. I have tried discharging the laptop several times.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Why would the system flag “lower wattage” with genuine chargers after a DC-in jack replacement?\n2. Is this likely an ID/sense pin or cable issue on the DC-in board, a missing resistor, or EC/firmware problem?\n3. Any safe way to bypass the warning so it charges normally?\n4. What should I check or replace next (DC-in board/cable, battery, EC reset, CMOS reset, etc.)?\n\nAny guidance or known fixes for this 2019 Legion Y7000 would help.",

I have a Gigabyte B450M-DS3H motherboard, and I've already updated the BIOS to the latest version, so it should support Ryzen 5000 CPUs. I am wondering whether I should upgrade to a Ryzen 5 5600 ($120) or Ryzen 7 5700X ($165).\n\nThe difference is price isn't big, but the B450M-DS3H has a very basic VRM, so I wonder if it will be a problem with the Ryzen 7 5700X (even though it's also rated at 65W). The CPU cooler is not an issue because I already have a Thermalright Assassin King 120 SE waiting for a new CPU.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor completeness, here is the complete PC parts list:\n\n||\n||\n|CPU|Ryzen 5 1600|\n|Motherboard|Gigabyte B450M-DS3H|\n|RAM|Corsair Vengeance 2x8 GB 3200MHz CL16 (CMK16GX4M2E3200C16)|\n|GPU|Gigabyte GTX 1660 Super (GV-N166SOC-6GD)|\n|Case|Corsair Carbide SPEC-ALPHA (black/grey)|\n|PSU|Corsair CX550M|\n|Storage|Corsair SSD 240GB MP510 + Seagate Barracuda 2.0TB 256MB|",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nThanks to your feedback regarding my current situation, I’ve got a much better understanding of my dilemma.\n\nSomeone suggested that it might be worth getting an entirely new system and I don’t doubt that. It’s just not within my possibilities right now though.\n\nIn my eyes, I’ve got these options:\n\n1. Save up for a new AM5 system\n2. Max out my AM4 system with a 5800XT or 5800X3D and a matching GPU\n\n2.1. Then build an AM5 system later\n\n3. Go with option 2, but instead build a new AM6 system in around 3–4 years\n\nIf I spend around **500–700 €** on a new CPU and GPU now (that my PSU can handle), I’ll have more fun for a couple of years. Then there’s a good chance I can upgrade straight to an AM6 system later, instead of “wasting” money I don’t really have on an expensive AM5 setup that might lead to the same situation again in a few years.\n\nOf course, I know that with tech, this will always be the game - and that’s just how things are. Still, I’d love to hear different opinions on my plan.\n\nI’ve got an **HP Omen 32c (2560×1440, 165 Hz)** monitor, and right now (According to the steam overlay) I’m getting around **80–100 FPS** without frame generation or anything like that, on **auto low (everything low)** settings.  \nMy goal would be a smoother experience with higher settings; ideally **120 + FPS on mid–high settings at 1440p**.\n\nMy idea is that I could enjoy a noticeably better experience now and for upcoming games, until I’m in a better financial situation. This way, I’m making the most out of my current setup and by skipping AM5, I’d actually turn my dilemma into a reasonable long-term plan.  \nIs there anything that speaks against this idea?\n\n**For reference, my specs:**\n\n* **Mainboard:** MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 3700X\n* **GPU:** 8 GB Gainward GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER Phantom GS\n* **RAM:** 32 GB G.Skill DDR4-3200\n* **PSU:** 550 W be quiet! Straight Power 11 Modular 80+ Gold\n* **Case:** be quiet! Dark Base 700\n* **Cooling:** Corsair Hydro Series H100i Platinum + be quiet! Silent Wings 3 PWM",

I’ve heard Nvidia’s drivers and optimization (especially through their app) can squeeze out more FPS through SLSS even with the RTX 4060. But the RX 7900 XT has way more raw power and VRAM.\n\nIs the extra €110 worth it for the AMD card, or does the 4060 + Nvidia ecosystem win out in WoW and general performance? Would my AMD CPU be better in sync with an AMD GPU?\n\nWould love to hear some experiences!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been running this setup for quite a while, and it used to work perfectly fine with all four DIMMs installed — but recently it started behaving strangely:\n\t•\tMotherboard: ASRock B450 Steel Legend\n\t•\tCPU: Ryzen 7 5700X\n\t•\tMemory: 4 × DDR4 @ 3200 MT/s (brand/model can be added)\n\nThe system used to POST and run normally with 4 sticks at the correct frequency, but lately the board started losing the memory settings and reverting to 2666 MHz under certain conditions.\n\nNow, whenever I remove or add any hardware (e.g., unplugging the PSU, removing/installing the GPU, or doing a full power cut), the motherboard “forgets” the memory frequency and resets to 2666 MHz.\n\nHere’s what happens in detail:\n\t•\tI have four sticks installed.\n\t•\tWhen this issue occurs, the system fails to POST and enters a boot loop.\n\t•\tTo make it work again, I need to remove two sticks, remove the CMOS battery, and use the Clear CMOS jumper.\n\t•\tAfter that, it boots fine with two sticks.\n\nBut if I shut down the PC and reinstall the other two sticks (to get all four back), the board immediately loses the settings again even if I don’t touch the battery.\nJust reinstalling the other two DIMMs triggers another reset to 2666 MHz, and the system fails to POST once more.\n\nTo recover, I have to repeat the same process every time:\nremove two sticks → remove battery → clear CMOS → boot with two DIMMs → reapply settings manually.\nAs soon as I try all four sticks again, it breaks.\n\nThis setup used to work perfectly at 2400 MHz for a long time, so something definitely changed either a BIOS behavior, a voltage retention problem, or memory controller issue.\n\nWhat I’ve tried so far:\n\t•\tReplaced the CMOS battery with a brand-new one.\n\t•\tUpdated BIOS to the latest stable version (can share version if needed).\n\t•\tManually configured memory frequency (stable until the next power cut or hardware change).\n\t•\tTwo DIMMs: completely stable.\n\t•\tFour DIMMs: works only after CMOS reset and temporary down-clock; breaks again after shutdown or hardware change.\n\nLooking for insights on:\n\t1.\tIs this a known issue with the B450 Steel Legend + Ryzen 5000 when running four DIMMs?\n\t2.\tCould this be a recent BIOS regression that causes memory frequency or XMP settings to be lost during full power removal?\n\t3.\tAny recommended voltage tweaks (SoC, VDDP, memory controller, etc.) that could stabilize 4×DIMM @ 3200 MHz on this board/CPU combo?\n\t4.\tIf this is hardware-related, would it make sense to replace the motherboard or keep using lower frequencies to avoid resets?\n\nThanks in advance for any help or ideas, especially if you’ve seen similar behavior on this specific board or chipset.",

I am also not extremely PC savvy, so I was hoping for some general advice as to whether I should upgrade this, or rebuild a PC, and what I should get at that.\n\nI bought my current PC in 2020 (I believe?), here are the stats:\n\n**CPU:** Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10400F CPU @ 2.90GHz\n\n**GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER\n\n**RAM:** 16 GB (2×8 GB)\n\n**Storage:** ADATA SU630 SSD\n\n**Motherboard:** ASUS PRIME H410M-K\n\nDon't know what PSU I have, maybe about 500W?\n\nCURRENTLY I'm more so leaning towards rebuilding, I think? I don't know how much I trust myself taking apart this thing and putting it back together, but I do want to know where to go with upgrading or rebuilding and what is the smarter choice. I plan to use this PC to play more AAA titles at higher graphics and framerates, and I'm looking into VR, so if there's anything relevant there I need to account for I'd like to know too.\n\nI don't have a very strict budget, but I would like to spend probably not much more than 3k on it all. I'm also based in Australia for context of availability. I bought my current PC from alliedgamingpc, and if they're reasonable to buy from again, I'd probably like to. If I can get an idea of what I should aim for, I might rebuild through them and let you all know what kind of prices they offer.\n\nI don't know what I'm really doing LOL. Thanks for any help you can provide!\n\nEdit: Thank you for the help, I'll look into a rebuild with the part list provided and sell my current PC!",

They’re super comfortable for me, and the sound is okay — I know any audiophile would probably rather die than listen to music on them, but honestly, they sound fine to me. I just want to upgrade, but no matter what I try, I can’t find the right headset.\n\nI mainly play CS2 and listen to music. I’d also like to use the headphones with my PS5, but that’s not a must-have — just a nice bonus if possible.\nI’m open to both wired and wireless options.\n\nHeadsets I’ve tried:\n\t\n•\tLogitech G Pro X2 Lightspeed – The sound feels like it’s coming from a bucket. I know about uninstalling G Hub and using an external EQ, but for that price, I don’t want to go through all that hassle. Even with EQ, it didn’t sound worth the price.\n\t\n•\tLogitech G522 – Same problem: the sound is really bad. I used the GadgetryTech EQ, which helped a bit, but still not worth €150 — even though the mic is pretty good.\n\n→ Honestly, I have no clue how, but both of these sound worse than my old, un-EQ’d G435.\n\t\n•\tSteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 / 7 – Not comfortable at all for me. I can literally feel the driver pressing on my right ear.\n\t\n•\tHyperX Cloud 3S Wireless – Maybe I got a defective unit, but I could clearly feel audio delay (using the 2.4 GHz dongle) compared to my G435 in CS2.\n\nYes, I know people say “all gaming headsets are overpriced junk,” but I just love the convenience of wireless.\nWith the G Pro X2 and G522, I at least expected slightly better sound than the G435 — but I couldn’t believe how hollow and distant they sounded (and yes, surround sound was turned off).\n\nNow I feel like I have no choice but to go wired, but even there I can’t decide.\n\nI know open-back headphones are better for FPS positioning, but I don’t like that they leak sound — I’d hear every noise from my room, and my girlfriend would hear everything from my headphones.\nAs for closed-backs, I was considering the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro, but I’ve heard they’re not great for positional audio in FPS games.\n\nSo yeah, I probably sound crazy for sticking with my G435 and being this picky, but I just want the best value for my money.\n\nI recently sold my external mic because I thought I’d mainly use the G522 (with its good mic), but since I returned it, I now have no mic at all — so I either need to buy a new mic or find a headset that includes a decent one.\n\nBudget: around €160–170 total, ideally including the mic.",

My current specs are: B550 AORUS ELITE V2 Motherboard, Amd Ryzeen 5 3500x CPU, AMD RX 5600 XT GPU, 16GB of RAM and a 500GB SSD and a 1TB HDD. I mainly use my PC for gaming and 3D rendering (Blender). My budget is around $500-600. I don't think my budget is enough for a brand new PC, should I save a bit more and try to build a whole new PC or would it just be better to upgrade some parts of my current PC?   \nSmall note, I'm mainly looking to get a NVIDIA GPU as it's a whole lot better for 3D rendering than AMD GPU's.\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated, thanks in advanced!",

    "title": "Need Help Deciding on CPU Upgrade",
    "selftext": "Hi guys, as the title shows, I just need help deciding on a CPU upgrade.\n\n  \nCurrently on a i5 10600K and I haven't had any issues with it until I jumped onto Arma Reforger and Battlefield 6. Reforger is much more bearable as it doesn't stutter but I do sit at 40fps on the Shadow Elite server (I'm mentioning that specifically in case any of you do play), BF6 is where I do see some issues with I believe timing. The graph does show that it frequently sits in the red and yellow zone especially while I am streaming on Discord for my partner.\n\n  \nI do play on 1440p and my GPU is the RX 6700 XT. Again, generally had no issues with my CPU so it has run perfectly fine up until I jumped into these newer games. MH Wilds is an issue too but I can't determine what would help make it run better but I know it generally has some performance issues which will then be touched up in the future like MH World. Other use cases for my PC is personal dev work.\n\n  \nI have seen a previous post actually recommending to switch to a different, more powerful CPU of my generation or the 11th gen to avoid incurring higher costs. Ideally, I want to sit below £500 for an upgrade and I am intending on waiting until tech deals come out or Christmas/Boxing Day or start of 2026 deals. \n\nI have considered a Ryzen 5 9600X as I don't really need anything special, it's newer, and runs at a lower TDP. I know that if I can stretch my budget, a 9700X would be really nice to have.\n\n  \nMy other question tied to the Ryzen platform is what motherboard I should ideally look for? I've seen the Gigabyte AORUS Elite B850 boards but they're usually sold out. I have considered the ASRock Steel Legend too but if I can get a really good motherboard for cheaper then I'm all ears.\n\n\n\nOverview of current setup: i5 10600K, RX 6700XT, 32GB RAM, EVGA G3 750W. Outside of this upgrade, my whole PC just needs a refresh since there are some old parts that I've had for a very long time.\n\n\n\n**TLDR**: On i5 10600K. Finding some performance issues on BF6 particularly, Arma Reforger, and MH Wilds. Play on 1440p and also use PC for dev work. Budget <£500, intending on waiting for sales. Have previously seen a post recommending to stay with LGA 1200 platform but a more powerful CPU to avoid incurring higher costs. Considering 9600X or 9700X, if budget allows for 9700X. Will need some recommendations for motherboard as have seen Gigabyte AORUS Elite B850 and am considering ASRock Steel Legend as the Gigabyte board is usually out of stock.\n\n  \nLooking for either affirmation for my choices or potentially other things I can consider within budget.",

    "selftext": "So I am going to re-pin my connectors on a non modular flex PSU to change cable length and upgrade to some silicone wires to easily fit in a SFF build. I was reading the pin out for the 24pin and thought what are these -12v and -5v connections? After some reading I see they are old legacy voltages for serial connectors and floppy drives etc. \n\nMy question then is if these old connections are not being used by modern motherboards can I just omit connecting those pins to have fewer cables to run? And in addition what other cables can be omitted to reduce the total amount of cables required? ",

I was planning on just buying a used GPU but it is literally cheaper to buy new than used ones here believe it or not. \n\nMy case is Fractal Torrent Nano, CPU Ryzen 5 7600X, PSU Asrock SL-750G, Motherboard ASUS Strix B650E-I, Only the GPU left. All the parts that I've bought are used except the PSU and the soon to be bought GPU. Would the ASUS motherboard somehow provide more compatibility if I buy the ASUS Prime GPU since they are the same brand? I've seen reviews from techpowerup's website and other YouTubers but still can't make up my mind.\n\nThank you and sorry for my english. ",

Right now, I’m using the HyperX Cloud Alpha headset along with its built-in microphone.\n\nRecently, I picked up a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (3rd gen) and an MXL 990 for about 70€, which seemed like a great deal — so I went for it. However, using the Cloud Alpha with this setup doesn’t really make much sense, since the headset doesn’t benefit from the Scarlett at all. On top of that, the MXL 990 picks up a lot of background noise (especially my keyboard), which isn’t ideal for gaming or meetings.\n\nI’d like to keep the Scarlett, but I’m open to changing the rest of the hardware. If you have recommendations for headphones or a microphone that would work well with it, I’d really appreciate it. Alternatively, if you think a gaming headset with a good built-in mic would make more sense for my use case, I’m open to that too.\n\nThe setup will mainly be used for gaming with friends and office work (lots of meetings). My budget is around 150–200€.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

The error is random every time, I've seen MEMORY_MANAGEMT, SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED AREA (also it's random chance if the computer will automatically restart after the BSOD or if I need to manually do so which is odd)\n\nSolutions I've tried that have NOT worked:\n- Tried both Windows 10 and 11\n- Created bootable USB via the official Windows Media Creation Tool\n- Created bootable USB with Windows 10/11 ISO using both Rufus and Ventoy (forget Ventoy, the Ventoy UI works completely fine and there is no crash until I actually go to the Windows ISO)\n- Updated BIOS (using the same USB drive)\n- Disconnected GPU\n- Seated my memory in every configuration possible \n- Ran memtest86 off the same USB drive for about an hour, passed all 4 times with 0 errors\n- Set memory speed down to 4800mhz\n- Disabled/Enabled Secure Boot and reset keys\n- Disabled/Enabled TPM 2.0\n- Disabled Memory Context Restore\n- Disabled Power Down Enable\n- Disabled EXPO\n- Disabled Precision Boost Overdrive\n- Disabled X3D Turbo Mode\n- Disabled ECO mode\n- Disabled Fast Boot\n- Disconnected all drives except the M.2\n- Disconnected all drives entirely\n- Manually set SoC Voltage to multiple values between 1.03 and 1.20 as I was told the motherboard could be putting it too low automatically?\n- Reset my BIOS about a dozen times\n- Also tried to install Ububtu out of curiosity.

As we are already above planed budget, I am looking for some proper recommendation out of this group.\n\nBasis of his system is a Medion PC Engineer P10 MD34555 from 2021 (i5 10400F, 16 GB Ram, Medion B460H6-EM, Geforce 1660 Super).\n\nOur plan war to upgrade graphic card and for that we needed to upgrade power supply as well (original was 450W). We choose an MSI GefoRce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Ventus and an Enermay Cyberg II 850. As it is still not running properly (screen gets black or looses signal) it seems we need to exchange motherboard as well.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Which microATX motherboard would you recommend to get system with graphic card? \n2. And would it be OK to stick to socket 1200 with i5 10400F (as we would like to avoid additional cost overrun for CPU)? \n\nAs addition some more information what we already did:\n\n* I checked specifications of initial system, new graphic card and power supply. Should work fine, but even first power supply seems to not fit into this (next point)\n* Initial power supply upgrade was an Enermax Revolution III 650W, but with new graphics we lost video within some minutes after starting. With bigger power supply this doesn't happen anymore.\n* System is using Win 11 and we took newest NVIDIA driver, we cleaned old driver via DDU, we reset OS fully - but graphics wasn't working after any of these activities\n* we tested 5060 Ti in system of a friend and it was running great - no issues and great performance (he offered to swap with his 1080 ;-))\n* When ever we get back to 1660 Super system is running fine and my son is able to play his games.\n* As we spend hours on research and hours on try and errors, I am looking for a solution to get it runnng so that my son is able to play\n* Of course it might be more usual to change motherboard and CPU as socket 1200 is quite outdated. But my son was never complaining about his CPU and so maybe it is better decision to no do this upgrade right now to avoid way higher costs (as motherboard might be between 60€ to 90€)",

The I/O panel fits fine, but I couldn’t screw in the top-left corner—it was too tight, and I thought the board was already properly seated.\n\nI connected the case cables. Everything seems fine, except the power switch cable: it’s a 2-pin connector, but the motherboard manual only showed a 1-pin setup for it.\n\nI installed the PSU. The 24-pin connector for the motherboard seems fine, but the 8-pin CPU cable was hard to reach, and I’m not sure it’s fully seated (I can’t pull it out easily, so maybe it’s okay?).\n\nAs for the GPU, I’m also not sure it’s seated perfectly. I installed it in the PCI slot closest to the CPU, but I couldn’t attach the Sapphire support bracket using all three screws—only the bottom two fit.\n\nObviously I plugged it to power so nothing happens.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! \n\nCurrently I have a AMD R7 2700x paired with a AMD RX 6700xt in a B450 motherboard. I think the cpu is starting to show it's age...\nI'm trying to decide if its worth the upgrade to get a R7 5800x and try to lengthen it's life or start saving for a new build. The 3d versions are out of question because they've got insanely expensive in my country, but I can get the non 3d 5800x for around 150€ and the 5700x for 140€.\nI don't game as much as I used to because life and children got in the way, so justifying a new build to the wife it's kind of complicated, haha....\nThanks for your responses!",

I received advice to take out the GPU and all the RAMs except A2. Lo and behold, it boots. Now I put a RAM into B2, nada.\n\nI have 4 RAM sticks. I’ve deduced that two are working, let call them RAM1 and RAM2. I tried the following combinations:\n\n1. RAM1 in A2 = boots\n2. RAM1 in B2 = boots\n3. RAM2 in A2 = boots\n4. RAM2 in B2 = boots\n5. RAM1 + RAM2 in A2 + B1 = boots\n6. RAM1 + RAM2 in A2 + B2 = does not boot\n\nI’ve also tried swapping the new CPU with the old CPU and still nothing.\n\nI’ve checked for bent pins in the CPU and there are none. The motherboard is showing an orange light. Is this a MOBO problem?",

    "selftext": "Recently built a pc on budget. Went with an i5-14600K paired up with an RTX5060Ti 16gb. But since I was trying to stay on my budget as much as I could I had to buy a cheap mobo. Picked up a Gigabyte H610M-K DDR4 Rev 2.0 and it seems that this was such a newbie move and trust me I thought I was just the opposite till now. Tried running few on ultra with DLSS(BF2042, Spider Man 2, Cyberpunk 2077) and they ran pretty much above my expectations. But each game had one issue in common, they had regular hiccups every 2 minutes. Installed HWinfo and Riva Tuner to look into temps and everything seemed fine CPU was below 60C and GPU was below 70C at any time under heavy load (including the 3 games given above). But at the same time, same load, the Vcore VR was always above 100C and every time it goes above 105 it stutters so bad and CPU clocks go down to 0.80Ghz. So I guess I have to go get a new mobo, but please if you are willing to provide any suggestions for a new mobo please please keep in mind that I am still on a budget and our economy is on the floor. Thanks for reading this unnecessarily long text about a simple problem :)",

    "selftext": "Recently built a pc on budget. Went with an i5-14600K paired up with an RTX5060Ti 16gb. But since I was trying to stay on my budget as much as I could I had to buy a cheap mobo. Picked up a Gigabyte H610M-K DDR4 Rev 2.0 and it seems that this was such a newbie move and trust me I thought I was just the opposite till now. Tried running few on ultra with DLSS(BF2042, Spider Man 2, Cyberpunk 2077) and they ran pretty much above my expectations. But each game had one issue in common, they had regular hiccups every 2 minutes. Installed HWinfo and Riva Tuner to look into temps and everything seemed fine CPU was below 60C and GPU was below 70C at any time under heavy load (including the 3 games given above). But at the same time, same load, the Vcore VR was always above 100C and every time it goes above 105 it stutters so bad and CPU clocks go down to 0.80Ghz. So I guess I have to go get a new mobo, but please if you are willing to provide any suggestions for a new mobo please please keep in mind that I am still on a budget and our economy is on the floor. Thanks for reading this unnecessarily long text about a simple problem :)",

    "selftext": "I had just finished rehousing my PC into larger case (a Fractal Meshify 2 XL) and just closed the side panel when it happened. Fortunately it happened outside the case, unfortunately it was not plunged in so there was no ground for the charge to dissipate into. The PC boots ok but I am still feeling a little spooked. I am hoping that because the charge had the whole case and PC to dissipate into it did not hit any sensitive components too hard. If it made it to the motherboard it would have likely been through the grounding standoffs but I don't know if that is good or bad. If anyone with more electrical knowledge can chime in I would appreciate it.\n\n\n\nThe irony here is that the whole reason I redid my pc is because I had bought a smaller case than I wanted in order to avoid a having a glass panel but ended up caving later. Guess where the static charge came from? from peeling the the protective plastic off the glass panel I did not want in the first place. Watch out when out peeling plastic protective film as it can cause you to build a static charge. I normally wear an ESD band but had taken it off because I was no longer working with internal components.\n\n\n\nAs a couple bonus tips to anyone reading or coming from Google later:\n\nYou can fit a Arctic Freezer III 420 with push pull fans (37mm rad + 2* 27mm fans) just fine up top in a Fractal Meshify 2 XL.\n\nThe Arctic Freezer III AM5 mounting system sucks and is a pain to install. I found that loosening the left bracket, starting the threading on both AIO screws, and only then tightening everything down is much easier than doing it the \"correct\" way. The problem is the the AIO screws are under tension and are prone to only letting you get one screw stated before flexing and making it impossible to thread the other screw. They don't even give you any locating pins to help hold the cold plate in aliment while you try to screw it in.",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nThanks to your feedback regarding my current situation, I’ve got a much better understanding of my dilemma.\n\nSomeone suggested that it might be worth getting an entirely new system and I don’t doubt that. It’s just not within my possibilities right now though.\n\nIn my eyes, I’ve got these options:\n\n1. Save up for a new AM5 system\n2. Max out my AM4 system with a 5800XT or 5800X3D and a matching GPU\n\n2.1. Then build an AM5 system later\n\n3. Go with option 2, but instead build a new AM6 system in around 3–4 years\n\nIf I spend around **500–700 €** on a new CPU and GPU now (that my PSU can handle), I’ll have more fun for a couple of years. Then there’s a good chance I can upgrade straight to an AM6 system later, instead of “wasting” money I don’t really have on an expensive AM5 setup that might lead to the same situation again in a few years.\n\nOf course, I know that with tech, this will always be the game - and that’s just how things are. Still, I’d love to hear different opinions on my plan.\n\nI’ve got an **HP Omen 32c (2560×1440, 165 Hz)** monitor, and right now (According to the steam overlay) I’m getting around **80–100 FPS** without frame generation or anything like that, on **auto low (everything low)** settings.  \nMy goal would be a smoother experience with higher settings; ideally **120 + FPS on mid–high settings at 1440p**.\n\nMy idea is that I could enjoy a noticeably better experience now and for upcoming games, until I’m in a better financial situation. This way, I’m making the most out of my current setup and by skipping AM5, I’d actually turn my dilemma into a reasonable long-term plan.  \nIs there anything that speaks against this idea?\n\n**For reference, my specs:**\n\n* **Mainboard:** MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 3700X\n* **GPU:** 8 GB Gainward GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER Phantom GS\n* **RAM:** 32 GB G.Skill DDR4-3200\n* **PSU:** 550 W be quiet! Straight Power 11 Modular 80+ Gold\n* **Case:** be quiet! Dark Base 700\n* **Cooling:** Corsair Hydro Series H100i Platinum + be quiet! Silent Wings 3 PWM",

I caught it mid-air so it didn’t make impact to the ground. \n\nI’m a little knowledgeable but not… phenomenally or remarkably, so when I noticed the Bluetooth on my PC was “not turned on” I immediately unplugged it, opened it up and took a look inside.\n\nVisually, nothing looks wrong other than some mild sagging of my GPU, which I fixed by just tightening it back up and I managed to fix the Bluetooth issue by just pressing on it to make sure it was in place, figured it was fixed because everything seemed to be working fine and went to bed.\n\nWoke up this morning, booted it up to work on some things and my keyboard, mouse and headphones were disconnecting and reconnecting every 10-15 seconds and I just now fixed it by simply just plugging them into different ports (still pending testing, who knows at this point, might still be an issue after posting this)\n\nI’ve never had any USB, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi issues until the fire nation (my cat) attacked last night.\n\nAs of right now, Bluetooth is back to not working. I guess I’m wondering if I need to go back in and look for physical issues again and if so, what should I be looking for??\n\nI have the ASRock A320M/ac, so the Bluetooth/wifi component is built into the motherboard, hence my hesitation to go in there messing with it without some sort of 3rd party insight.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar issue and can point me in the right direction I’d be appreciative.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI went caveman style and started (gently) pushing anything I could see. Booted it up, everything works fine now. I have no idea which component was causing it but I am gonna wait and see if it happens again. For now, it’s running fine and my cat is indefinitely banned from being within 6 feet of my PC.\nHe has no remorse. He screamed in my face earlier.\n\n",

    "selftext": "  \nHowdy all,\n\nI've finally caved and decided to build my first gaming PC. Since I know little to nothing about this process, I had a friend help me put together the following on PCPartPicker (open to feedback):\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.2 GHz 8-Core Processor\n\nThermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler\n\nGigabyte B850 AORUS ELITE WIFI7 ATX AM5 Motherboard\n\nTEAMGROUP T-Create Expert 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory\n\nCrucial P3 Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive\n\nXFX Swift Radeon RX 9070 XT 16 GB Video Card\n\nPhanteks XT PRO ATX Mid Tower Case\n\nMSI MAG A750GL PCIE5 750 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply\n\nARCTIC P12 Pro PST 77 CFM 120 mm Fans 5-Pack\n\nMy plan has been to build this PC over time, buying somewhere between one and three parts over the next few paychecks. This just makes sense to me that way I can just factor things into my budget as opposed to saving first and then buying. I was wondering if anyone had advice on what order to buy things especially since black friday is coming soon. Are there parts that are better to wait on as opposed to buying up front? I hope that makes sense!\n\n",

    "selftext": "My friend made me a question the other day \"which is better 4060 ti 8gb or 9060 xt 8gb?\" I instantly said neither, 8gb of vram is enough and surely there is something better in the used market for that price. But the more I thought about it the less true that became.\n\nIt is true that newer and non optimized titles need more than 8gb, but is there really anything that is equal or better in that 9060 xt 8gb price range? You can find the powercolor model for 270 in amazon. Excluding games that need more than 8gb, it destroys anything else in price to performance. I cant even find an equivalent in the used market for that price.\n\nIf it later in its life drops to around 250, wouldnt it just be the defacto card, the 16gb version is significantly more expensive at 350 USD.\n\nSo, im asking, is it actually that bad? And what price do you think it needs to be to be good?\n\n  \n  \nSome extra stuff. Im thinking of upgrading at some point in the next year and so it my friend, so we are looking for gpus. We have massive import taxes on items over 200. Anything over 200 has a 20% tax added so a 250 USD card becomes a 300 USD so the lower the better. If you have any recommendations for what cards are good right now, new or used im all ears.",

I’ve heard Nvidia’s drivers and optimization (especially through their app) can squeeze out more FPS through SLSS even with the RTX 4060. But the RX 7900 XT has way more raw power and VRAM.\n\nIs the extra €110 worth it for the AMD card, or does the 4060 + Nvidia ecosystem win out in WoW and general performance? Would my AMD CPU be better in sync with an AMD GPU?\n\nWould love to hear some experiences!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been running this setup for quite a while, and it used to work perfectly fine with all four DIMMs installed — but recently it started behaving strangely:\n\t•\tMotherboard: ASRock B450 Steel Legend\n\t•\tCPU: Ryzen 7 5700X\n\t•\tMemory: 4 × DDR4 @ 3200 MT/s (brand/model can be added)\n\nThe system used to POST and run normally with 4 sticks at the correct frequency, but lately the board started losing the memory settings and reverting to 2666 MHz under certain conditions.\n\nNow, whenever I remove or add any hardware (e.g., unplugging the PSU, removing/installing the GPU, or doing a full power cut), the motherboard “forgets” the memory frequency and resets to 2666 MHz.\n\nHere’s what happens in detail:\n\t•\tI have four sticks installed.\n\t•\tWhen this issue occurs, the system fails to POST and enters a boot loop.\n\t•\tTo make it work again, I need to remove two sticks, remove the CMOS battery, and use the Clear CMOS jumper.\n\t•\tAfter that, it boots fine with two sticks.\n\nBut if I shut down the PC and reinstall the other two sticks (to get all four back), the board immediately loses the settings again even if I don’t touch the battery.\nJust reinstalling the other two DIMMs triggers another reset to 2666 MHz, and the system fails to POST once more.\n\nTo recover, I have to repeat the same process every time:\nremove two sticks → remove battery → clear CMOS → boot with two DIMMs → reapply settings manually.\nAs soon as I try all four sticks again, it breaks.\n\nThis setup used to work perfectly at 2400 MHz for a long time, so something definitely changed either a BIOS behavior, a voltage retention problem, or memory controller issue.\n\nWhat I’ve tried so far:\n\t•\tReplaced the CMOS battery with a brand-new one.\n\t•\tUpdated BIOS to the latest stable version (can share version if needed).\n\t•\tManually configured memory frequency (stable until the next power cut or hardware change).\n\t•\tTwo DIMMs: completely stable.\n\t•\tFour DIMMs: works only after CMOS reset and temporary down-clock; breaks again after shutdown or hardware change.\n\nLooking for insights on:\n\t1.\tIs this a known issue with the B450 Steel Legend + Ryzen 5000 when running four DIMMs?\n\t2.\tCould this be a recent BIOS regression that causes memory frequency or XMP settings to be lost during full power removal?\n\t3.\tAny recommended voltage tweaks (SoC, VDDP, memory controller, etc.) that could stabilize 4×DIMM @ 3200 MHz on this board/CPU combo?\n\t4.\tIf this is hardware-related, would it make sense to replace the motherboard or keep using lower frequencies to avoid resets?\n\nThanks in advance for any help or ideas, especially if you’ve seen similar behavior on this specific board or chipset.",

Always screen go black, i cant save game so i assume that the pc is off, not just screen.\n\nWhat i thought and what i tried:  \nChecking temps and consumption on cpu and gpu, stable, no spikes or anything weird, ran multiple times, with hwinfo logging.  \nChecking Event viewer, it says that there is event 17, HAL problem. From googling people say its bad psu. I did not look into it for a year, just lowered possible gpu consumption and thought its windows problem. A month back clean installed both arch and windows. Thought its a motherboard bios issue, update did not fix anything. Except after update its much more rare that after shutdown gpu fans start going 100%.\n\nFrom ai i found out that its possible that it is a timing issue related to dual boot. It said to set both to use local time. Still shutting down, but i fee like it takes much longer. Idk.\n\nI am lost. I dont know anyone here who could have this type of a psu to check. Do i go and buy new psu? and in case it does not help, i return it and know its gpu,\n\ni5 13500  \nits rx6800. bought used from store, we stress tested it there for like 20 min, seemed fine  \ngold 80+ psu for 850w",

I am also not extremely PC savvy, so I was hoping for some general advice as to whether I should upgrade this, or rebuild a PC, and what I should get at that.\n\nI bought my current PC in 2020 (I believe?), here are the stats:\n\n**CPU:** Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10400F CPU @ 2.90GHz\n\n**GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER\n\n**RAM:** 16 GB (2×8 GB)\n\n**Storage:** ADATA SU630 SSD\n\n**Motherboard:** ASUS PRIME H410M-K\n\nDon't know what PSU I have, maybe about 500W?\n\nCURRENTLY I'm more so leaning towards rebuilding, I think? I don't know how much I trust myself taking apart this thing and putting it back together, but I do want to know where to go with upgrading or rebuilding and what is the smarter choice. I plan to use this PC to play more AAA titles at higher graphics and framerates, and I'm looking into VR, so if there's anything relevant there I need to account for I'd like to know too.\n\nI don't have a very strict budget, but I would like to spend probably not much more than 3k on it all. I'm also based in Australia for context of availability. I bought my current PC from alliedgamingpc, and if they're reasonable to buy from again, I'd probably like to. If I can get an idea of what I should aim for, I might rebuild through them and let you all know what kind of prices they offer.\n\nI don't know what I'm really doing LOL. Thanks for any help you can provide!\n\nEdit: Thank you for the help, I'll look into a rebuild with the part list provided and sell my current PC!",

They’re super comfortable for me, and the sound is okay — I know any audiophile would probably rather die than listen to music on them, but honestly, they sound fine to me. I just want to upgrade, but no matter what I try, I can’t find the right headset.\n\nI mainly play CS2 and listen to music. I’d also like to use the headphones with my PS5, but that’s not a must-have — just a nice bonus if possible.\nI’m open to both wired and wireless options.\n\nHeadsets I’ve tried:\n\t\n•\tLogitech G Pro X2 Lightspeed – The sound feels like it’s coming from a bucket. I know about uninstalling G Hub and using an external EQ, but for that price, I don’t want to go through all that hassle. Even with EQ, it didn’t sound worth the price.\n\t\n•\tLogitech G522 – Same problem: the sound is really bad. I used the GadgetryTech EQ, which helped a bit, but still not worth €150 — even though the mic is pretty good.\n\n→ Honestly, I have no clue how, but both of these sound worse than my old, un-EQ’d G435.\n\t\n•\tSteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 / 7 – Not comfortable at all for me. I can literally feel the driver pressing on my right ear.\n\t\n•\tHyperX Cloud 3S Wireless – Maybe I got a defective unit, but I could clearly feel audio delay (using the 2.4 GHz dongle) compared to my G435 in CS2.\n\nYes, I know people say “all gaming headsets are overpriced junk,” but I just love the convenience of wireless.\nWith the G Pro X2 and G522, I at least expected slightly better sound than the G435 — but I couldn’t believe how hollow and distant they sounded (and yes, surround sound was turned off).\n\nNow I feel like I have no choice but to go wired, but even there I can’t decide.\n\nI know open-back headphones are better for FPS positioning, but I don’t like that they leak sound — I’d hear every noise from my room, and my girlfriend would hear everything from my headphones.\nAs for closed-backs, I was considering the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro, but I’ve heard they’re not great for positional audio in FPS games.\n\nSo yeah, I probably sound crazy for sticking with my G435 and being this picky, but I just want the best value for my money.\n\nI recently sold my external mic because I thought I’d mainly use the G522 (with its good mic), but since I returned it, I now have no mic at all — so I either need to buy a new mic or find a headset that includes a decent one.\n\nBudget: around €160–170 total, ideally including the mic.",

My current specs are: B550 AORUS ELITE V2 Motherboard, Amd Ryzeen 5 3500x CPU, AMD RX 5600 XT GPU, 16GB of RAM and a 500GB SSD and a 1TB HDD. I mainly use my PC for gaming and 3D rendering (Blender). My budget is around $500-600. I don't think my budget is enough for a brand new PC, should I save a bit more and try to build a whole new PC or would it just be better to upgrade some parts of my current PC?   \nSmall note, I'm mainly looking to get a NVIDIA GPU as it's a whole lot better for 3D rendering than AMD GPU's.\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated, thanks in advanced!",

Picked up a Gigabyte H610M-K DDR4 Rev 2.0 and it seems that this was such a newbie move and trust me I thought I was just the opposite till now. Tried running few on ultra with DLSS(BF2042, Spider Man 2, Cyberpunk 2077) and they ran pretty much above my expectations. But each game had one issue in common, they had regular hiccups every 2 minutes. Installed HWinfo and Riva Tuner to look into temps and everything seemed fine CPU was below 60C and GPU was below 70C at any time under heavy load (including the 3 games given above). But at the same time, same load, the Vcore VR was always above 100C and every time it goes above 105 it stutters so bad and CPU clocks go down to 0.80Ghz. So I guess I have to go get a new mobo, but please if you are willing to provide any suggestions for a new mobo please please keep in mind that I am still on a budget and our economy is on the floor.

    "selftext": "I had just finished rehousing my PC into larger case (a Fractal Meshify 2 XL) and just closed the side panel when it happened. Fortunately it happened outside the case, unfortunately it was not plunged in so there was no ground for the charge to dissipate into. The PC boots ok but I am still feeling a little spooked. I am hoping that because the charge had the whole case and PC to dissipate into it did not hit any sensitive components too hard. If it made it to the motherboard it would have likely been through the grounding standoffs but I don't know if that is good or bad. If anyone with more electrical knowledge can chime in I would appreciate it.\n\n\n\nThe irony here is that the whole reason I redid my pc is because I had bought a smaller case than I wanted in order to avoid a having a glass panel but ended up caving later. Guess where the static charge came from? from peeling the the protective plastic off the glass panel I did not want in the first place. Watch out when out peeling plastic protective film as it can cause you to build a static charge. I normally wear an ESD band but had taken it off because I was no longer working with internal components.\n\n\n\nAs a couple bonus tips to anyone reading or coming from Google later:\n\nYou can fit a Arctic Freezer III 420 with push pull fans (37mm rad + 2* 27mm fans) just fine up top in a Fractal Meshify 2 XL.\n\nThe Arctic Freezer III AM5 mounting system sucks and is a pain to install. I found that loosening the left bracket, starting the threading on both AIO screws, and only then tightening everything down is much easier than doing it the \"correct\" way. The problem is the the AIO screws are under tension and are prone to only letting you get one screw stated before flexing and making it impossible to thread the other screw. They don't even give you any locating pins to help hold the cold plate in aliment while you try to screw it in.",

Go with option 2, but instead build a new AM6 system in around 3–4 years\n\nIf I spend around **500–700 €** on a new CPU and GPU now (that my PSU can handle), I’ll have more fun for a couple of years. Then there’s a good chance I can upgrade straight to an AM6 system later, instead of “wasting” money I don’t really have on an expensive AM5 setup that might lead to the same situation again in a few years.\n\nOf course, I know that with tech, this will always be the game - and that’s just how things are. Still, I’d love to hear different opinions on my plan.\n\nI’ve got an **HP Omen 32c (2560×1440, 165 Hz)** monitor, and right now (According to the steam overlay) I’m getting around **80–100 FPS** without frame generation or anything like that, on **auto low (everything low)** settings.  \nMy goal would be a smoother experience with higher settings; ideally **120 + FPS on mid–high settings at 1440p**.\n\nMy idea is that I could enjoy a noticeably better experience now and for upcoming games, until I’m in a better financial situation. This way, I’m making the most out of my current setup and by skipping AM5, I’d actually turn my dilemma into a reasonable long-term plan.  \nIs there anything that speaks against this idea?\n\n**For reference, my specs:**\n\n* **Mainboard:** MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 3700X\n* **GPU:** 8 GB Gainward GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER Phantom GS\n* **RAM:** 32 GB G.Skill DDR4-3200\n* **PSU:** 550 W be quiet! Straight Power 11 Modular 80+ Gold\n* **Case:** be quiet! Dark Base 700\n* **Cooling:** Corsair Hydro Series H100i Platinum + be quiet! Silent Wings 3 PWM",

I caught it mid-air so it didn’t make impact to the ground. \n\nI’m a little knowledgeable but not… phenomenally or remarkably, so when I noticed the Bluetooth on my PC was “not turned on” I immediately unplugged it, opened it up and took a look inside.\n\nVisually, nothing looks wrong other than some mild sagging of my GPU, which I fixed by just tightening it back up and I managed to fix the Bluetooth issue by just pressing on it to make sure it was in place, figured it was fixed because everything seemed to be working fine and went to bed.\n\nWoke up this morning, booted it up to work on some things and my keyboard, mouse and headphones were disconnecting and reconnecting every 10-15 seconds and I just now fixed it by simply just plugging them into different ports (still pending testing, who knows at this point, might still be an issue after posting this)\n\nI’ve never had any USB, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi issues until the fire nation (my cat) attacked last night.\n\nAs of right now, Bluetooth is back to not working. I guess I’m wondering if I need to go back in and look for physical issues again and if so, what should I be looking for??\n\nI have the ASRock A320M/ac, so the Bluetooth/wifi component is built into the motherboard, hence my hesitation to go in there messing with it without some sort of 3rd party insight.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar issue and can point me in the right direction I’d be appreciative.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI went caveman style and started (gently) pushing anything I could see. Booted it up, everything works fine now. I have no idea which component was causing it but I am gonna wait and see if it happens again. For now, it’s running fine and my cat is indefinitely banned from being within 6 feet of my PC.\nHe has no remorse. He screamed in my face earlier.\n\n",

Right now the RX9060XT 16GB GPU's that has the lowest price on amazon 54k yen (~$355) are Sapphire Pulse and Asus Prime, but the Sapphire has a \"point\" deal which will net me about 3.5k yen (~$25) cashback after purchase which is great, but seeing some posts suggested that having 3 fans is more worth it for the cooling. I was planning on just buying a used GPU but it is literally cheaper to buy new than used ones here believe it or not. \n\nMy case is Fractal Torrent Nano, CPU Ryzen 5 7600X, PSU Asrock SL-750G, Motherboard ASUS Strix B650E-I, Only the GPU left. All the parts that I've bought are used except the PSU and the soon to be bought GPU. Would the ASUS motherboard somehow provide more compatibility if I buy the ASUS Prime GPU since they are the same brand? I've seen reviews from techpowerup's website and other YouTubers but still can't make up my mind.\n\nThank you and sorry for my english. ",

    "selftext": "My friend made me a question the other day \"which is better 4060 ti 8gb or 9060 xt 8gb?\" I instantly said neither, 8gb of vram is enough and surely there is something better in the used market for that price. But the more I thought about it the less true that became.\n\nIt is true that newer and non optimized titles need more than 8gb, but is there really anything that is equal or better in that 9060 xt 8gb price range? You can find the powercolor model for 270 in amazon. Excluding games that need more than 8gb, it destroys anything else in price to performance. I cant even find an equivalent in the used market for that price.\n\nIf it later in its life drops to around 250, wouldnt it just be the defacto card, the 16gb version is significantly more expensive at 350 USD.\n\nSo, im asking, is it actually that bad? And what price do you think it needs to be to be good?\n\n  \n  \nSome extra stuff. Im thinking of upgrading at some point in the next year and so it my friend, so we are looking for gpus. We have massive import taxes on items over 200. Anything over 200 has a 20% tax added so a 250 USD card becomes a 300 USD so the lower the better. If you have any recommendations for what cards are good right now, new or used im all ears.",

For a week it worked fine then it started crashing and one day it just wouldn’t boot (smelled smoke as well).\n\nI reseated the GPU, CMOS, CPU, RAM, etc. My Gigabyte BIOS is at F32 which should be compatible with 14th Gen. I received advice to take out the GPU and all the RAMs except A2. Lo and behold, it boots. Now I put a RAM into B2, nada.\n\nI have 4 RAM sticks. I’ve deduced that two are working, let call them RAM1 and RAM2. I tried the following combinations:\n\n1. RAM1 in A2 = boots\n2. RAM1 in B2 = boots\n3. RAM2 in A2 = boots\n4. RAM2 in B2 = boots\n5. RAM1 + RAM2 in A2 + B1 = boots\n6. RAM1 + RAM2 in A2 + B2 = does not boot\n\nI’ve also tried swapping the new CPU with the old CPU and still nothing.\n\nI’ve checked for bent pins in the CPU and there are none. The motherboard is showing an orange light. Is this a MOBO problem?",

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

Jeanette and Therese, the haunted house quest, damn it was good.\nThis feeling to be a monster, powerful, free, cover by vice decafance and sensuality..and humour. \n\nSo yeah, I knew VTM: Bloodlines 2 wouldn’t be great but a part of be wish they gat at least the atmosphere, the \" cool\" factor! ...well They dint and it turned out to be a disappointment. I was ready to play something less open-world, more action-driven, without the full open world and multi-gameplay style of the first.\n\nWhen I started the game, I had a little bit of hope... until they showed me the skill sheet and I realized how simple it was. I became... sad.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, it just doesn’t have a soul. It’s boring. The voice acting for every character, including the main one, is dull and lifeless, with no energy or personality. It lacks the sensuality, the vice, the dirtiness that made the first game unforgettable. The game feels too clean, like the studio didn’t want to take any risks. The female Nomad is boring as hell. Fabian the Malkavian is slightly less boring, but still not entertaining. And he’s a freaking Malkavian!\n\nThe controls are stiff, the combat is dull (I chose Tremere, maybe that was a mistake), and the game is full of bugs. The music... well, it’s somewhere? But when it plays, it completely lacks that epic gothic techno vibe from the first game.\n\nThat said, I do like the graphic style. It looks good. There’s something there, something that could make a great game if they knew what to do with it.\n\nI really hope this isn’t the last game of the series. I want a third one, something that lets them finally make a good game. I hope they listen to the community’s feedback and run with it.\n",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been wondering about this for a while. Why don’t we have headphones that can tell if a sound’s coming from above or below when you tilt your head? It’s pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound’s coming from. I don’t see any technical reason why we can’t have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response – there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

    "selftext": "Hi!  \n\n  \nSince this game is getting more attention with its upcoming release, I wanted to highlight an aspect about animation work.  \n\nYou’ve probably seen clips where the ARC drones (environmental enemies) attack players in pretty spectacular ways.  \nExample:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oa6sr6/mistakes\\_were\\_made/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oa6sr6/mistakes_were_made/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI came across an article explaining how EMBARK creates these animations, and I think it deserves more attention than yet another scripted destruction system we see in big AAA titles. [https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "**Greetings, everyone!**\n\nOur upcoming project - a medieval RPG **Legacy of Valor** \\- is on Kickstarter, and we've already surpassed our first stretch goal.\n\nBut first, I'd like to introduce you to the game itself.\n\n**Legacy of Valor** is a medieval RPG that blends **castle building**, **territory management**, **large-scale battles**, and a **story-driven narrative** into one immersive experience. In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Husák! 😊), but soon, **thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his **passion, enthusiasm, and desire** are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Husák himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to **expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile – and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point, **we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that **Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*“Hey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors — If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you’re gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step — launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign — just like old times — and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let’s rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let’s build that castle from the ground up — together.”*\n\nWe can’t express how much this means to us. **Warhorse Studios inspired us** \\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives **Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let’s carry this legacy forward. **Together!**\n\nKickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit: [r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX: [https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website: [https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

    "selftext": "I purchased Ryse: Son of Rome on August 29th. This was the first time I ever purchased from Humble Bundle. At the time and to this day, I have not seen a banner on Humble's store indicating they are out of keys for Ryse: Son of Rome. I am using Chrome and not running any ad blocker, so I suspect this is not an issue with my personal browser. These banners are referenced in Humble's FAQ on key exhaustion. I have exchanged 3 messages with humble support inquiring about the lack of a banner and if the 60-day refund window applies if I have not received a key. Not only did they take on average 7 days to respond they also talked around my questions and provided no real support. I am willing to give a great deal of leeway, after all, this is for charity. That said, the dishonesty or ineptitude of the support team and the implication that Humble can keep my money and provide me with nothing in return just leaves me with a gross feeling that I can't shake. I will never use this storefront again. I have only ever heard good things about Humble. Am I just phenomenally unlucky, or is this a common experience no one talks about?",

    "selftext": "Hi r/pcgaming, I'm Sketchwhale of takunomi, the developer of The Girl Who Kicked a Rabbit, a short stat-less, arcade-like JRPG with a puzzle-twist on turn-based combat.\n\nTrailer\nhttps://youtu.be/52qctQ0a_I8?si=fIfJTVp38trzRdxs\n\nThe game is about a single night of patrol for a young combat wizard (a dabbler) called Lumi, who has to fight increasingly powerful demon rabbits that spawn from... Somewhere.\n\nThe biggest twist, is that the battles are fewer, but longer, with new enemies spawning, dropping loot, and allowing you to craft DURING combat.\n\nIt's a bit like an OVA anime from a larger universe.\n\nWe launched in April, but the game is on sale now, and we added a real nice update during the Autumn sale, so I thought I'd give it a try and tell you about the game.\n\nDesign-wise, I tried to focus on having fewer, but more tactically worthwhile spells, and enemies that are mechanically interesting.\n\nSince launch we've put out a few free updates, and hope to make more. Of note is the extra difficult secret level in the final world. We're very attentive to feedback, and the last update was about helping players deal with how they experienced randomness.\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, both the good and the bad stuff.",

    "title": "A good 'Hard' difficulty and a bad 'Hard' Difficulty mode.",
    "selftext": "Just now I was playing mafia 2. I am 9 hours into the game and I started the game with hard difficulty like I have started to do with all of my games recently. I have come at a level that is simply impossible to cross, not because of any skill issue but simply because this game has a bad 'Hard' difficulty mode.\n\nThere are games where hard difficulty simply means a basic buff to all enemies. They function like normal npc's but their damaged is increased, they spot you unreasonably fast, and even their pistols shoot kilometers (miles) away and it takes a takes a whole mag to kill one enemy. Your gameplay does not change. You still take cover and shoot, you simply stay in cover for longer, and have to shoot the same enemy twice as much, but its the same.\n\nIn this particular mission in mafia, the enemies are just unfair. Rather than enemies coordinating better, they and their guns have simply been buffed. And I am not lying when I say this, I cannot shoot a Thompson at my target after a certain distance because of insane recoil, my enemies, with that same Thompson, are killing me with 2 bullets from twice that distance. Molotov cocktails fall in front of my cover but I still get damage, and the most baffling part is that I get some damage even behind covers.\n\nThis is a bad hard mode, although understandable because the game came out in 2010. In such a mode, you can overcome with skill only to be lead to such an instance where skill can not overcome the bad design. Like how my enemy keeps throwing molotovs every 5 seconds in a small space filled with constantly spawning enemies, I peak and someone shoots me, I play smart and get killed by a Molotov that isint even near me.\n\nI am also playing wolfenstein currently and it has a much better hard mode. Its actually challenging but most of all, its reasonably challenging, you can improve and get better or retry until you finally clear a level. Enemy damage does increase but they don't turn into bullet sponges, enemies coordinate better and have better reflexes rather than being one shot kill. In Wolfenstein you just have to plan better, remember the med kits and the Armour and use them strategically. But mafia 2 doesnt offer me any such option, the gameplay is yet the same regardless of difficulty.",

When you can rent game by getting 1 month of pc game pass (15 € after price hike which is still reasonable). The game has about 12 hours of content from what I've seen.\n\n  \nAnd down the line if you wanna replay it you can probably buy it for much lower price on sale anyway. Just don't get paying 80 € for game. \n\nFYI: for some reason some companies are pricing games at 70 $/80 €, while others are doing 70 $/70 €. ",

Developing for VR has definitely been a different experience compared to normal game development .. challenging at times if I have to be honest.   \n  \nI’ve learned a lot along the way and willing to learn more especially with the help and feedback from the community! In this game you have to get to your objectives by blowing your trench whistle but the catch is the enemies can hear your whistle too, footsteps on wooden floor (if they squeek), dropping bottles or hitting them, etc. Thanks for checking it out!

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

    "title": "toggleHDR util for Windows",
    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

Jeanette and Therese, the haunted house quest, damn it was good.\nThis feeling to be a monster, powerful, free, cover by vice decafance and sensuality..and humour. \n\nSo yeah, I knew VTM: Bloodlines 2 wouldn’t be great but a part of be wish they gat at least the atmosphere, the \" cool\" factor! ...well They dint and it turned out to be a disappointment. I was ready to play something less open-world, more action-driven, without the full open world and multi-gameplay style of the first.\n\nWhen I started the game, I had a little bit of hope... until they showed me the skill sheet and I realized how simple it was. I became... sad.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, it just doesn’t have a soul. It’s boring. The voice acting for every character, including the main one, is dull and lifeless, with no energy or personality. It lacks the sensuality, the vice, the dirtiness that made the first game unforgettable. The game feels too clean, like the studio didn’t want to take any risks. The female Nomad is boring as hell. Fabian the Malkavian is slightly less boring, but still not entertaining. And he’s a freaking Malkavian!\n\nThe controls are stiff, the combat is dull (I chose Tremere, maybe that was a mistake), and the game is full of bugs. The music... well, it’s somewhere? But when it plays, it completely lacks that epic gothic techno vibe from the first game.\n\nThat said, I do like the graphic style. It looks good. There’s something there, something that could make a great game if they knew what to do with it.\n\nI really hope this isn’t the last game of the series. I want a third one, something that lets them finally make a good game. I hope they listen to the community’s feedback and run with it.\n",

Developing for VR has definitely been a different experience compared to normal game development .. challenging at times if I have to be honest.   \n  \nI’ve learned a lot along the way and willing to learn more especially with the help and feedback from the community! In this game you have to get to your objectives by blowing your trench whistle but the catch is the enemies can hear your whistle too, footsteps on wooden floor (if they squeek), dropping bottles or hitting them, etc. Thanks for checking it out!

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

    "selftext": "I currently have an Rtx 4050 victus 15 which I've been using for a couple while now, and it has served me well. Had gotten it for around 650-700 dollars.\n\nHowever, as of late, I'm feeling the laptop feel \"weak.\" As expected, 6gb vram really is limiting my use cases which include mostly gaming and video editing (Predominantly premiere pro and after effects.) The laptop is still fine. It does almost all the things I want it to do. It just feels slow now. And because of that I've been leaning towards getting a new device with an Rtx 5080/5090. Would love a 4090 but they don't really seem to be available in Italy.\n\nI am aware of it's drawbacks compared to a regular built PC. It cannot be upgraded except SSDs and RAM, which is the reason I'm considering high end models with high end laptop GPUs. I want to use this laptop, in an ideal scenario, for 8 years. I know that the 5090 laptop chip is inherently a 5080 chip that is more optimized to run at lower powered devices. \n\nI currently have three options on what to do. Here is my dilemma:\n\n1) I can outright get an Rtx 5090 laptop. I'm considering Legion 7i, XMG Neo with AMD HX/HX3D CPUs and the HP omen max Rtx 5090. Which, of the the three, the HP doesn't seem to be available currently. When choosing a laptop, my main criteria are that it shouldn't be larger than 16 inches and that it shouldn't look like the wet dream of an RGB loving 13 year old. This option will cost me around 4000 euros which is A LOT of money.\n\n2) I can delay the purchase of a new laptop for 1-2 years and squeeze the last bit of life juices out of my current laptop. I do not know if this will be cheaper on the long term or if the prices of the aforementioned laptops will become lesser.\n\n3) I can scrap the purchase of a laptop and build a good old desktop PC. It will give more performance for the same price and it will have long term upgrade options. HOWEVER, in my current situation this seems very troubling. I currently spent 25 percent of time in a different country. Considering the transport of a desktop internationally is pretty much impossible with all the peripherals, this means that I can realistically use the desktop for only 70 percent of my time.\n\n\nWhich one seems to be the most viable option according to y'all? Any other suggestions on what to do or maybe different laptop models?\n",

I do it through the windows settings and everything went fine then after it was done I got a screen saying automatic repair so something must’ve went wrong, I tried a bunch of different fixes like going into safe mode but that just brought me right back to the automatic repair screen. I tried doing some things in command prompt and nothing worked. It gave me another way to try another fresh installation so i clicked that and clicked on the cloud installation but after some time it gave me another error saying I couldn’t do that. I then did another reset this time I clicked local installation instead of cloud and it seemed to work and it started doing its thing no problem, after it was done it just keep boot looping infinitely. I can get into bios but it seems like I cant do anything in there to fix this. Im thinking my only hope now is to get a usb and install through the windows media installation?

PC is mostly use for gaming only though my 8yr old daughter is planning to record and stream her roblox hahaha (not sure if its CPU intensive though)",

I haven’t used either of the keys yet. Both keys are legitimate and retail.\n\nHe suggested that I activate my Windows with the Pro for Workstations key, since it’s like the normal Windows 11 Pro but has more features, and give him my normal Windows 11 Pro key to use (I didn’t ask him exactly what for).\n\nMy question is: is Windows 11 Pro for Workstations actually better, or does it have any drawbacks that might make it worse? I mainly use my computer for normal tasks like browsing and gaming, so it might be overkill. My dad said that I might get more use out of it if I ever learn to do the kind of work he does, but I’m not sure.",

    "selftext": "I wanted to get second opinions on this. I noticed that if I have a monitor that's larger than 40 inches, I tend to have headaches and I feel dizzy if I use them for more than an hour. Having my current 39 inch is pushing my limit a bit, but it's easier because the size is substantially smaller.\n\nI discovered this problem after buying a Samsung G9, which was 49 inches with an 1000r curve. It was a very immersive experience but my my gpu and my headaches couldn't handle it.\n\nI remember I was always shifting my head one side to another and it was exhausting. But there was also a lot more information on the screen that overwhelmed me and the visual stimuli became too much. There just wasn't a good reason to play for more than an hour without my head hurting.\n\nMaybe it's autism and my sensitivities to too much visual noise, but I never quite understood why I got those headaches. It's was just awful.\n\nThis monitor ended up not being used much after awhile as I often defaulted to my 32 inch that I had at the time before I sold the 49 inch monitor.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nReally having a bit of a hard time. As the title suggests I can’t get my PC to stay on, I’ve tried the old ChatGPT for help but I feel like I’m going round it circles. \nLittle back story - Last week I upgraded my GPU to a RX 6700 XT 12 GB, after a few games on BF6 I realised it was being bottlenecked therefore I upgraded my CPU to a Ryzen 5 5600 XT. This is where my issues began, I had already prepared to update my bios, got it all onto a usb stick etc, however since then it wouldn’t stay on. Sometimes it would get into BIOS mode, showing the correct version then shut off after pressing F10 to save and exit. I realised maybe it was my PSU being to low a wattage, so I bought a 750w Corsair PSU to still no success. This left me to believe it must be the motherboard as it was a fairly old B350-Plus, so I’ve bought a new B550 today which says it’s 5000 series ready, however still no luck. I’ve tried everything from CMOS reset, to a barebones start up out of the case. I even had another CPU sent out as I thought that was the issue. It so intermittent that sometimes it stays on for 30 seconds and some it will hardly stay on past 5 seconds. At this point I’ve essentially built a new PC and it’s still not working.\n\nAny help is appreciated \n\nKind Regards",

The initial decline starts at 60 degrees Celsius, where it has been for over an hour, so not thermal throttling. \n\nUsually exiting the game and immediately restarting it fixes this issue.

I picked out the following:\nRyzen 7 7800X3D, RTX 4070 SUPER (12G Ventus 2X OC), 16x2 DDR5 5200 CL40, MSI MAG 650BN 650W, and the MSI B650 PLUS WIFI. \nI have heard that the CPU ive chosen is “the best” and the GPU is good for it aswell, but i am more concerned if ive chosen enough wattage, and the reliability of the PSU\nI was also a little disappointed that the “best” gaming CPU only supported DDR5 5200 and not higher.\nThanks in advance.",

    "selftext": "I had my MSI 5090 Suprim Liquid for five months without any issues until yesterday. Suddenly, the screen went black during moderately graphic intensive work in Unreal Engine, but the sound still was on. \nAfter a reboot, the motherboard gave me a D6 error (no GPU found), and there was a noticeable stench of burnt plastics coming from the PC, so I was fearing the worst. \nWhen I tried to disconnect the card from the included MSI power cable, it was really hard to pull out (plastic welded as I later realised). The cable was definitely fitted all the way in, and the PC case is also large and well-ventilated, and there was no strain whatsoever on the cable. I can definitely rule out any user error here.\nWhen I finally managed to pull it out, I saw all six (+) power cables smoked.\n\nThis is a $3000 card, and I bought it in the hopes that the large liquid cooler would keep temperatures at bay. But it seems like nothing can compensate for NVIDIA’s foolishness going again with this terribly designed connector.\nI’m totally devastated having wasted so much money on this card… \n\nAt least I managed to shut off the PC before it burned my house down. As I’m usually leaving the PC unattended for rendering at night. This is a huge health and safety risk and could easily lead to fires and potentially killing people. I can’t believe the largest company in the world is not able to design their cards adequately. I’m aware this is an MSI product, but Nvidia insist that every manufacturer uses this horrible connector.\n\n[UPDATE]\nI have reached out to MSI for a warranty claim, but they told me I need to get in touch with my local vendor Scan.\nScan initially accepted the request but wanted me to pay for shipping and insurance of that 8lb box on my own dime, as it is a \"damaged goods return\". And insuring such an expensive box turns out to be quite pricey.\n\nThis morning they suddenly changed their stance and a pre-paid courir will pick it up tomorrow.\nThis is likely due to this post, which I have mentioned in my correspondence with customer support. \n\nI can't thank you enough for all the upvotes and I'll keep you posted on this.\n\n \nRE choice of cable: Many of you have pointed out not to use the included MSI cable and instead the 12v6x2 from my Corsair PSU, which most PSUs won't even provide. When I built the PC I've watched this video https://youtu.be/6FJ_KSizDwM?si=MTw-3uioJ0wdiR_M&t=486 which strongly recommends not to use the Corsair PSU cable because of the bad quality and instead use the MSI cable which was praised for it's quality.\n\nDo with this information what you want, but it seems the current consensus is to use the PSU cable.",

This steady drop also causes FPS and GPU temperature to drop. The CPU spikes upwards as the GPU plummets as if it’s trying to pick up the slack? GPU use remains steady at 48-50% there after. The initial decline starts at 60 degrees Celsius, where it has been for over an hour, so not thermal throttling. \n\nUsually exiting the game and immediately restarting it fixes this issue. But have to exit, there’s nothing else that fixes it. Changing graphics settings, minimizing, etc, it will not revert to using the GPU over the CPU without restarting the application.\n\nI’m stumped",

Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

I was able to make the MagSafe mount for $8 and the monitor riser I made myself by using the same dimensions from various manufacturers. \n\nRocking a 34” LG ultra-wide and man I love it. Have basic Logitech pebble key 2 and a Logitech M550.\n\nI’ve got only one cable coming to the Mac which is my HP dock located under my desk (wish I could post more pictures)\n\nGot my DJ mixer up top as I love DJing but since I’m full time school I’ve really been off that and focused on school. Really like my setup I’ve only got one cable coming down which is my power cable and cable management is really clean. This also took me a bit as I was trying to figure out the best solution. My solution was using a server rack cable management module that’s aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you’d do!",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

    "selftext": "After almost a decade, I’ve been slowly getting soured by the keyboard hobby earlier in this year cos of a lot of factors like some vendors disappearing after taking our money. And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

    "title": "Tex Shinobi - mini-review",
    "selftext": "A quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "title": "Overhauled Lemokey L3",
    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to “dynamat” which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I’ve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that’s ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn’t hard with the tool they provide. I’ve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It’s the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn’t know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn’t reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won’t be my daily driver but it’s a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI’ll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .  everything went smoothly;  no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.  It’s probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and “how to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers” videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).  Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote  - without needing to look at any references during the build.  \n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced — just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;  make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;  checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn—->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys).  \n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:  prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it’s too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you’re probably excited to complete quickly.  The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta’ get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**  if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n   **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;  $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;  unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.  (I’m liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n ",

It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper.\n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone as some reccomended it to me but GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust AI 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at an odd location. \n\nWhat other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested.

    "title": "HMX Firecracker has tickled a weird part of my brain and I may never recover: a review.",
    "selftext": "First and foremost - I'm a tactile switch lover through and through. I've tried a fair number this year, the most recent being the Sillyworks x Gateron Type R. I've tried both more budget options (I see you Akko V3 Cream Blue Pro!) and more premium offerings like the Drop x Invyr Holy Pandas. I've spent too much money but honestly I no longer care because I may have found IT. The one. Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

    "selftext": "I recently picked up this Hummingbird68 for $49+shipping (30ish bucks to the USA, if I recall) as a way to mess around with an HE Keeb: [https://clickclack.io/products/click-clack-x-kochi-hummingbird68-magnetic-switch-mechanical-keyboard-kit](https://clickclack.io/products/click-clack-x-kochi-hummingbird68-magnetic-switch-mechanical-keyboard-kit)\n\nStock the quality is shocking for the price, the case is well made, feels decent, sounds okay if a bit loud for my tastes, keycaps are solid, ect. The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

    "title": "Tex Shinobi - mini-review",
    "selftext": "A quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to “dynamat” which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I’ve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that’s ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn’t hard with the tool they provide. I’ve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It’s the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn’t know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn’t reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won’t be my daily driver but it’s a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI’ll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .  everything went smoothly;  no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.  It’s probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and “how to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers” videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).  Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote  - without needing to look at any references during the build.  \n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced — just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;  make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;  checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn—->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys).  \n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:  prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it’s too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you’re probably excited to complete quickly.  The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta’ get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**  if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n   **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;  $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;  unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.  (I’m liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n ",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

Just thought this was funny)\n\nSaw a listing on the site that I figured had to be a mistake - an Attack Shark M86 tri-mode hot swap keyboard with one of the colour options listed as £3.83, with local shipping.\n\nI’m like “There’s no way they’ll honour that. They’ll either cancel or just ship a cable or something”.\n\nEither way, placed the order anyway on Sunday night (19th), it went through with no issue.\n\nThe order then showed as shipped yesterday, and I’m thinking cool, at least I’ll get *something* for my money, especially as the one I ordered has since had its price corrected and is now saying it does not ship to my location.\n\nLo and behold, they actually honoured the sale and the keyboard arrived today (via Amazon, no less) so I’m probably going to give it to my 14 year old son as his first mech board to play with.",

    "selftext": "After almost a decade, I’ve been slowly getting soured by the keyboard hobby earlier in this year cos of a lot of factors like some vendors disappearing after taking our money. And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

I don’t care about refresh rate or latency, since I don’t plan to use it for gaming. The only problem is the budget: 200-300 euros. Can anyone suggest some decent monitors in that price range or does a widescreen oled monitor cost more than that?\nAlso, are there any technologies that are cheaper than oled but offer similar accuracy when displaying the color black? if so, that’s better (i’ve heard about mini-led but i don’t know anything about monitors)\n",

    "selftext": "So i right Now have a really old monitor as a secondary monitor and an okay 1080p/60hz monitor as main monitor. My plan is to replace the secondary with the main and by a new main computer. \n\nBut I got really confused over What specs are important. Resolution, hz, inches, screen type and so on. My dream is to have 1440p, hz 144 or more, 27 inch, oled. But that seemed very expensive, i Will mostly game on this monitor. Such as gowr, hogwarts legacy, ghost of tsushima and so on.\n\nWhich specs of the monitor is worth sacrificing for orders generally? Is there a cheaper version of oled thats good or is 1440p really much greater than 1080p?",

    "selftext": "I have this laaptop:  \nLenovo Legion 7 Pro Ai - 16 Inch - Core I9-13900HX 24core - 32GB Ram - 2TB SSD - 2K (2560x1600) 240hz -RTX 4090 16GB and I set it to 1080p so I can mirror the screen to my old 1080p 60hz tv by using HDMI. I am using this HDMI cable [https://www.jumbo.ae/hama-ham-122221-high-speed-hdmia-cable-plug-plug-ethernet-gold-plated-2-0-m.html](https://www.jumbo.ae/hama-ham-122221-high-speed-hdmia-cable-plug-plug-ethernet-gold-plated-2-0-m.html) and I bought it in 2021.\n\nI want to buy:\n\n1. A new monitor which is [https://961souq.com/products/asus-rog-strix-xg43uq-43-4k-gaming-monitor-144hz](https://961souq.com/products/asus-rog-strix-xg43uq-43-4k-gaming-monitor-144hz)\n2. A new surround sound soundbar which is [https://961souq.com/products/samsung-s-series-soundbar-hw-s66d-5-0ch](https://961souq.com/products/samsung-s-series-soundbar-hw-s66d-5-0ch)\n\nI want to mirror the laptop screen which is set to 1080p to the monitor and I should get 144hz on the monitor when I do that.\n\nThe soundbar supports HDMI ARC, optical, aux and bluetooth.\n\nI can pair the soundbar to my laptop or tv but the problem is that the electricity cuts multiple times daily as it switches between government electricity and generator electricity and when that happens the soundbar and monitor will switch off and then back on. I am unsure if the soundbar will automatically pair again when it switches on so pairing by bluetooth is messy.\n\nMy laptop and the monitor don't have HDMI ARC.\n\nThe simplest solution is I use an AUX audio cable but if I do that then I will lose the surround sound and I don't want that.\n\nThus the remaining option is I use optical and I have to get an HDMI audio extractor box. I have to connect my laptop to HDMI input of the box and connect the monitor to the HDMI output of the box. The box should have an optical port for the audio and I will connect the soundbar to it and I should get surround sound if I do that. When the electricity cuts then the tv, sound bar and the HDMI audio extractor box will switch off but everything should resume when they switch back on.\n\nThere are some cheap quality HDMI audio extractor boxes which say 4k 60hz. They could be 60hz at 1080p so that means that I will get 60hz on the monitor if I use a cheap quality HDMI audio extractor box. Thus I need to buy a proper HDMI 2.1 audio extractor box like [https://www.amazon.com/Extractor-Optical-Adapter-Speakers-Headphones/dp/B0FCYVBZPK/ref=sr\\_1\\_4](https://www.amazon.com/Extractor-Optical-Adapter-Speakers-Headphones/dp/B0FCYVBZPK/ref=sr_1_4) which supports 1080p 120hz and it could give me 144hz. Is what I said correct?\n\nMy HDMI wire is old and it could be HDMI 2.0 certified. Is that ok or I need to buy a new HDMI wire which is HDMI 2.1 certified? I think that a HDMI 2.0 certified wire is enough for 1080p 120hz or 144hz and I don't need a HDMI 2.1 certified wire. Is what I said correct?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m building a new PC and want to buy **three identical monitors** (my current setup is 10 years old). Budget is **around 250€ per monitor**. I do almost everything on my PC as a hobby: work, casual gaming, graphic design, programming, video editing, movie watching, and game dev. Most important to me: **good image quality, reliable panel, and decent response time**. I’ve never run above 60 Hz and I’m not playing competitively, so a high refresh rate isn’t a priority but a good thing to have. Also I’d like them to be **released during 2024/25**. Just in advance - I have no clue about monitors or what makes a good one.\n\n**Hard requirements:**\n\n* **Size:** 27\"\n* **Resolution:** 2560 × 1440 (QHD)\n* **Budget:** ≈ €250 per monitor\n* **Quantity:** 3 identical units\n* **Release Date:** 2024/25\n\n**Monitors I found:**\n\n* **LG UltraGear 27GS85QX-B (27\")**\n* **MSI MAG 274QFDE X24 (27\")**\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Are these two solid choices for my mixed use (especially casual gaming + creative work)?\n2. Are there better alternatives around the same price that I should consider?\n3. Anything special to watch for when buying three identical monitors (color consistency, calibration, warranty, panel lottery, connectors, etc.)?\n\nAppreciate clear advice. Thank you!",

Any reliable recommendations I missed?",

Non davano neanche fastidio più di tanto, ma col tempo sono un po’ aumentate. \n\nOra ho comprato un cavo display port, sia per sostituire il cavo hdmi in dotazione che utilizzavo, sia per escludere che si trattasse del cavo, e come potete vedere questo è il risultato. Devo dire che i lampi che vedete dalla gif non li aveva mai fatti, ma dopo un po’ si fermano e rimangono solo le righe. \n\nQuindi mi chiedo, sta peggiorando il monitor oppure è possibile (sperando di no) che si tratti della GPU?\n\nSpero di aver postato nella sezione giusta",

Please recommend any options that you've found it truly good, I think i'll try to stretch my budget a bit if you say it's worth it. \n\nThank you",

    "selftext": "Currently on an old Aoc FHD 144hz trying to make the jump to a nice looking 1440p monitor, im not deadset on OLED and have also considered the Aoc mini-led q27g3xmn but wouldnt mind spending more as long as its under 600€.\n\n-Usecase is mostly gaming/media consumption\n\n-Games i play varies alot but no comp. FPS\n\n-Preffered refresh rate would be 240 - 280 but 180 should also be fine\n\n-My room dosent get too bright at daytime, so no preference between glossy or coated \n\n-Wouldnt want to spend extra on higher screen size/ultrawide\n\nThe only things im worried about on OLED are brightness, text clarity and VRR flicker (which also effects the mini-led), i've read that QD-OLED usually has better text clarity than WOLED, but its supposed to be improved on with the mo27g28g aswell as brightness.\nUnfamilliar with OLED care features and which one has the better ones.\n\n\nAs for the mini-led, its obviously alot cheaper but also has its fair share of downsides (and upsides) like bad VRR flicker, possibly blacksmearing, lower local dimmingzones than some newer Aoc mini-leds (that arent available in europe i think) and lastly slower response/higher input latency (not a comp. Fps player idk if i should care). Also have heard that they can get quite hot which would be concerning since i usually play for long-ish periods at a time, dont know if thats an OLED problem aswell.\n\nNo knowledge/experience with HDR and HDR ratings, for example the aoc q27g3xmn has a HDR1000 rating vs the mo27g28g with a HDR500 rating, whats the difference? Does it matter alot?\n\n\nWill be building my new pc in the next 1-2 months incase there are any upcoming monitors that come out later this year that i should keep an eye on im open to any suggestions.\n\n\nWould love to hear from people that have one of these models and/or can compare OLED and mini-led from their own experience.\n\nThank you.",

[P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

I don’t care about refresh rate or latency, since I don’t plan to use it for gaming. The only problem is the budget: 200-300 euros. Can anyone suggest some decent monitors in that price range or does a widescreen oled monitor cost more than that?\nAlso, are there any technologies that are cheaper than oled but offer similar accuracy when displaying the color black? if so, that’s better (i’ve heard about mini-led but i don’t know anything about monitors)\n",

My main concern is the screws not actually screwing into the monitor and the cpu spacers being more of a proxy. Should I get screws that go all the way through?",

Of all the things I saw on the Internet the Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 was suggested a lot of times. Does anyone of you have experiences with that monitor? How is it compared to an IPS Panel?

I am using this HDMI cable [https://www.jumbo.ae/hama-ham-122221-high-speed-hdmia-cable-plug-plug-ethernet-gold-plated-2-0-m.html](https://www.jumbo.ae/hama-ham-122221-high-speed-hdmia-cable-plug-plug-ethernet-gold-plated-2-0-m.html) and I bought it in 2021.\n\nI want to buy:\n\n1. A new monitor which is [https://961souq.com/products/asus-rog-strix-xg43uq-43-4k-gaming-monitor-144hz](https://961souq.com/products/asus-rog-strix-xg43uq-43-4k-gaming-monitor-144hz)\n2. A new surround sound soundbar which is [https://961souq.com/products/samsung-s-series-soundbar-hw-s66d-5-0ch](https://961souq.com/products/samsung-s-series-soundbar-hw-s66d-5-0ch)\n\nI want to mirror the laptop screen which is set to 1080p to the monitor and I should get 144hz on the monitor when I do that.\n\nThe soundbar supports HDMI ARC, optical, aux and bluetooth.\n\nI can pair the soundbar to my laptop or tv but the problem is that the electricity cuts multiple times daily as it switches between government electricity and generator electricity and when that happens the soundbar and monitor will switch off and then back on. I am unsure if the soundbar will automatically pair again when it switches on so pairing by bluetooth is messy.\n\nMy laptop and the monitor don't have HDMI ARC.\n\nThe simplest solution is I use an AUX audio cable but if I do that then I will lose the surround sound and I don't want that.\n\nThus the remaining option is I use optical and I have to get an HDMI audio extractor box. I have to connect my laptop to HDMI input of the box and connect the monitor to the HDMI output of the box. The box should have an optical port for the audio and I will connect the soundbar to it and I should get surround sound if I do that. When the electricity cuts then the tv, sound bar and the HDMI audio extractor box will switch off but everything should resume when they switch back on.\n\nThere are some cheap quality HDMI audio extractor boxes which say 4k 60hz. They could be 60hz at 1080p so that means that I will get 60hz on the monitor if I use a cheap quality HDMI audio extractor box. Thus I need to buy a proper HDMI 2.1 audio extractor box like [https://www.amazon.com/Extractor-Optical-Adapter-Speakers-Headphones/dp/B0FCYVBZPK/ref=sr\\_1\\_4](https://www.amazon.com/Extractor-Optical-Adapter-Speakers-Headphones/dp/B0FCYVBZPK/ref=sr_1_4) which supports 1080p 120hz and it could give me 144hz. Is what I said correct?\n\nMy HDMI wire is old and it could be HDMI 2.0 certified. Is that ok or I need to buy a new HDMI wire which is HDMI 2.1 certified? I think that a HDMI 2.0 certified wire is enough for 1080p 120hz or 144hz and I don't need a HDMI 2.1 certified wire. Is what I said correct?",

So now i cannot turn them on anymore and decided to use them with the aux cord that came with them (big reason why i bought them is to have the aux option). They work, but the sound is bad. Very flat and kinda reverb-y. Does anyone know if this is just how they sound when they are connected via aux? Can i fix this?\n\nAlso i'm glad if you can recommend any good overear headphones for up to 300 bucks. I've never been a fan of my marshalls other then them looking nice",

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

    "selftext": "There seem to be infinite claims about these headphones. From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

The back of the headphones is plastic and has picked up a few scratches over time.\n\nThese days I use headphones every day for commuting, work, and workouts, so I’ve been trying different models recently. After testing ones from Bose, Sony, Skullcandy, and Baseus, I’ve been using the XH1 a lot. The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ. It also folds easily, and the ear pads are soft and comfy. I’m not an expert, but it’s been a solid experience overall. ",

    "selftext": "So over the last week I’ve been really enjoying the Omegas. That being said, the design wasn’t my favorite. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack location felt awkward, the rotation limiter that attaches on the side felt like an afterthought, and the driver cap, although unique, looked a little weird. \n\nTaking some not-so-subtle design cues from the Dahlia and Tungsten, this was my attempt to solve all those aesthetic issues. Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "title": "Audiophile Verdict of Bose QC Ultra 2 Headphones: DO NOT BUY 1ST GEN!",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

This buzzing remains until I go to bed, but then goes away by the time I wake up.\n\nHowever, if I use the same headphones without the ANC on this does not happen. (Or at least not nearly as much?)\n\n  \nSooo, does anyone have any intel on cases like this? Anything that can be done? Has there been any formal research on this?\n\nThanks in advance for the help!",

When I first tested these on a song Call me now by INNA and Michael Calfan, compared to my Pros 2, the punch of bass disappeared, and things sounded narrow like diffuse field-based tuning or Moondrop VSDF Tuning—also with the fact that her voice got really sharp.\n\nHowever, with the AirPods Pros 3, good Adaptive noise cancellation and the feature to turn off after you fall asleep, and 8 hours of battery life, along with its bass response and resonance peak. This may sound weird, but I have been listening to Sydney Sweeney jeans ads and a couple of whisper ASMR content. Pros 3 actually sounded excellent for this content, allowing me to listen to low volume with this content having that satisfying feeling that I can't describe. Like whisper sounded crisper and more delightful. I assume this is due to the \"vivid vocal clarity\" claim that Apple made. Can anyone relate?",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, £16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

    "selftext": "I'm potentially in the market for my first pair of earbuds and I had a few questions I was hoping y'all could help with. I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

I use bone conduction headphones when out of the house even though the sound quality is terrible, and when I'm inside I use speakers.

I know I would be giving up some fidelity by doing that, and the sound leakage would mean I need to be discerning of where I wear them, but I think it would still be better than bone conduction.",

    "selftext": "So, I’ve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn’t stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it’s no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they’d be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they’re better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they’re still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I’m really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say “sufficient”) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an “active analog mode” which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you’re looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC… look no further!",

    "selftext": "This is my project headphone for my high school design course.\n\nIt needed to fit the following criteria:\n\n* comfortable for long hours with ultralight weight construction\n* sound quality on par with other reference/studio headphones\n* priced relatively affordable compared to the market\n\n**specs:**\n\n* Driver: Peerless 50 mm driver\n* mass: 170g (without cable)\n* materials:\n   * earcups: PLA-LW and PLA\n   * headband strap: Faux leather\n   * earpad: aliexpress 110mm hybrid velour\n   * everything else: PETG\n* Connection: dual 3.5mm\n\n**Comfort**\n\nBeing 170 grams already makes this a comfortable headphone; it feels weightless on the head. Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws.

    "title": "I am disappointed in my Momentum 4s",
    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

Start of 2025 I pressed reset on my 14 pair collection. I was wearing maybe 5 pairs monthly and all the others were just collecting dust. So I got rid of them all. \n\nI wanted to rediscover how it felt to enter the hobby once again this time knowing what I like and how I've changed. I also wanted to explore all of these OG brands that have all these prestige having been a chifi guy.\n\nI picked each of these up £50 from eBay. K550 and ad500x. Sitting down EQ, pads and cable mod. It has been so much more fun and satisfying. I feel like I helped make them show their soul. They also sound great. ",

So now i cannot turn them on anymore and decided to use them with the aux cord that came with them (big reason why i bought them is to have the aux option). They work, but the sound is bad. Very flat and kinda reverb-y. Does anyone know if this is just how they sound when they are connected via aux? Can i fix this?\n\nAlso i'm glad if you can recommend any good overear headphones for up to 300 bucks. I've never been a fan of my marshalls other then them looking nice",

    "selftext": "There seem to be infinite claims about these headphones. From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

I’ve seen this is a common problem and doesn’t have a solution other than replacement. Price isn’t an issue, I’m only looking for long-term reliability. Thanks.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, £16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

This buzzing remains until I go to bed, but then goes away by the time I wake up.\n\nHowever, if I use the same headphones without the ANC on this does not happen.

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ.

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance?

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

Eventually, I really liked the Xbox 360 controller, and I could play well enough. Now I understand that the Steam Deck can cause cramps in some people's hands during long gaming sessions, and I was wondering about your experiences with this. As I live in Europe and their is not really a placee to try out a deck in a store to feel how its configuration works for my hands.   \n  \nAny advice on this?? thank you!  ",

However I saw some posts that suggested that you don’t get any order tracking for a few days? How reliable is Valve in shipping & delivery? I won’t have to worry about any mishaps there right?\n\nAnd since I won’t have warranty, how reliable are these devices?\n\nSomeone please answer as the alternative is a Switch 2 and that is extremely costly and I’m afraid of that drifting.",

I need to know what could’ve even caused this?\n\nLast time I used it I shut steam OS down properly, I booted into windows 11 using my boot manager and shut windows 11 down. I’ve heard things that windows update can attempt to overwrite other partitions on your drive which can corrupt steamOS and trigger a reset. I’m not sure if that was my issue though, funnily enough windows 11 is still working fine. In fact it sometimes directly boots into it and ignores the boot screen, not all the time though.\n\nSo is this a windows 11 thing? If it is then it’s completely unacceptable from Microsoft and makes the OS unusable. I’m just annoyed I’ll now have to boot into recovery and sort the partitions out again. Has anyone experienced this issue? It’s been working fine for a good week or so.\n\nAlso side note, can I recover deleted files in steamOS? I know you can do it on windows using recuvra and such. I was playing dark souls 2 before the steamOS reset and it doesn’t support steam cloud.\nCan I retrieve these save files? I’m not using the OS at the moment incase I overwrite those deleted files.",

But when I use that button to open the menu (inventory, skill tree progress, map, ect,) - about 80% of the time, all the buttons go dead and I can’t navigate the menu, or even exit out. So then I have to hit the ‘steam button’, then close, at which point all the buttons in the menu work suddenly and I can navigate navigate the menu.\n\nHaving to do this constantly is super annoying. Any fix? Am I missing something? TIA ",

    "selftext": "Issue: Battery stuck at 0 and isnt charging at all. Unplugging just shuts down the deck (LCD) immediately so I can’t recalibrate thru letting it die in BIOS.\n\nHad to replace the og battery because it was already in its “spicy” phase. Ordered a Getac one and replaced it. \n\nThings I’ve done: \n1. Upon removing the og battery, I tried running the deck thru the charger. Charger plugged, no battery. Tested some light games Ni No Kuni 2 and some Emulation with Unicorn Overlord. With the charger plugged, it would power down especially when game gets heavy or theres too much going on. This happened around 5-10 times. Then I limited the TDP to 10 and the shut downs stopped. (Again this is with charger plugged ONLY and no battery) \n\n2. When I received the new battery, immediately hooked it up and booted the deck. 37% and CHARGING but the battery had a “h? m?” So i figured I needed to calibrate it. Had it drained fully but then it never came up again. I think I messed up by letting it drain down to 0.\n\n3. Tried removing the battery pin, let it sit a while and reconnect it. \n\n4. Tried leaving it on charge both ON and OFF on separate days and even charged it while pn desktop mode. \n\n5. Followed the battery storage mode instructions and even the “minus volume button + “…” + “Power”. Basically almost all the previous posts in the thread. ;(\n\n6. Tried different chargers, both 65w and lower.  \n-used the og charger eversince. Og Charger can charge other devices without issues soI doubt its the problem. \n\nQuestions: \n1. Idk if 5.90 V (2nd pic) is normal but from what I’ve seen from other screenshots, it seems the voltage is too low? Is this normal? \n\n2. Is there a tool/device that electronic repair shops could tell which has an issue? Like can they check if my type c port is faulty or is it the battery?\n\nCan't reach out to Valve for repair since I'm in SEAsia and the deck (LCD) was bought in 2023.",

It won’t open.\n* Nexus and GameBanana installers mention needing the loader and Reloaded but give Windows instructions only.\n\n**Where I’m stuck:**\n\n* How to properly run Reloaded in my SD\n* How to use DSTS mod loader with Reloaded\n* How and where to place mod files so the game launches with mods on Deck.\n\nSo yeah, if anyone knows about / can provide a step-by-step checklist that I can run on the Deck (exact protontricks commands, where to drop files in the prefix, how to set Steam launch options, how to confirm Reloaded is loaded) with screenshots or exact file paths, I would greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "When streaming from PS5 to Steam Deck via PSPlay, I experienced high input lag. For a long time, I couldn't figure out what was causing it, but today I finally got the idea to try running PSPlay not in gaming mode, but in desktop mode. And wow, the lag turned out to be significantly lower in desktop mode. Does anyone know what the issue might be? And how can I reduce the lag in gaming mode?",

    "selftext": "I first had to get it verified by Steam and then optimize it for the system. I used a MS font so I had to replace the font and make it fit for the system. Text boxes had to change in size and certain settings had to be added to make it work. But I'm very satisfied with the result. I hope more players give it a serious change, now that it is more accessible. It’s completely free as well. \n\nLink: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2342860/Twell/\n\nThis is a repost by the way. My previous post got removed by moderators because I didn’t use the “promotional” flair. I didn’t do that for a reason. I didn’t want it to look like that it costs something. I wanted to say thank you to everyone who congratulated me in my previous post, it was very nice. \n\nTo be clear, this game is free, it has no additional costs, no paid DLC, no commercials, nothing. I simply wanted to make this game and now I hope people are willing to play it because there went a lot of work into making it. I rather see 100 players instead of 10 paid players. \n\nI started making this back in 2012, so basically it was more than 10 years in development. But I made it while I was studying and working. And I paid a programmer, an artwork designer, a sprite designer and 2 musicians to help me.",

But apart from some early Ubuntu 20 years ago (or more, maybe), I never experienced much of Linux and my memory of it was not the best.\n\nNow, it's such an awesome OS!\n\nI just bought a refurbished 27 inch, 1440p, 144 Hz, AOC gaming display in a really good sale. Added a Ugreen dock and USB-C switch (like the old-days KVM interfaces) for my mouse and keyboard (to be shared between my 8 year old Windows laptop and the new Steam Deck \"desktop\".\n\nI set the external display as primary and set it to 1440p 144 Hz. Super crisp and fluid. But.... it has some stuttering and hiccups. I eventually reduced it to 120 Hz and it seemed more stable.\n\nFor those of you that use the Deck in a dock, as a desktop, what was the sweet spot for you in terms of resolution and refresh rate, for it to behave nicely?\n\nEDIT: not going to try and play at 1440p, guys, just to use it as desktop for browsing, office work, etc.",

    "selftext": "Kind of a noob question, but I'm curious of the quality of Remote Play over a local network as well as with resolution output.  \n\nFor context, I used to have my PC and TV in the same room and used my 4k tv as a second monitor which I would play games on via Big Picture Mode.  I recently moved and now my TV is in the living room and PC is in the office.  I kind of got used to playing my PC on my couch and find it hard to go back to the computer desk for a lot of games.\n\nI was thinking of moving my PC to my living room but then I would lose the desktop setup for other games (FPS etc)  I saw that the Steam Deck has a dock which connects to HDMI which might be the solution I'm looking for.  While I like the portability of the Deck, I'm wondering if I can just use it as an access point to my PC and connect it to the TV while using controller or mouse and keyboard to game from my living room (basically using it as a replacement for Big Picture Mode). \n\nWould the Steam Deck be worth the price if I mainly use it docked to stream my PC to my TV?  I'm afraid of the latency while playing over a wifi network as well as upscaling the resolution to 1440 or 4k.  I feel like this would be a considerable downgrade from using the TV as a monitor but maybe I'm wrong?  Does anyone else use their Deck this way?\n\nThanks!",

But apart from some early Ubuntu 20 years ago (or more, maybe), I never experienced much of Linux and my memory of it was not the best.\n\nNow, it's such an awesome OS!\n\nI just bought a refurbished 27 inch, 1440p, 144 Hz, AOC gaming display in a really good sale. Added a Ugreen dock and USB-C switch (like the old-days KVM interfaces) for my mouse and keyboard (to be shared between my 8 year old Windows laptop and the new Steam Deck \"desktop\".\n\nI set the external display as primary and set it to 1440p 144 Hz. Super crisp and fluid. But.... it has some stuttering and hiccups. I eventually reduced it to 120 Hz and it seemed more stable.\n\nFor those of you that use the Deck in a dock, as a desktop, what was the sweet spot for you in terms of resolution and refresh rate, for it to behave nicely?\n\nEDIT: not going to try and play at 1440p, guys, just to use it as desktop for browsing, office work, etc.",

Only the first two episodes are out for now, but I'd expect it to get the Steam Deck verified tag.\n\nhttps://steamdeckhq.com/game-reviews/dispatch/\n\n\"On the Steam Deck, Dispatch runs absolutely perfectly. The interface scales well to the smaller screen, with crisp text and intuitive navigation that never feels cramped, and with equally impressive performance being rock-solid so far, locked to an immaculate 60fps, with quick load times, it feels right at home. Battery usage has been light, too, ranging between 7W - 10W, which makes it ideal for longer, more involved play sessions away from the ever-reliable charger.\n\nNo notes, this is a fantastic game to play on the Steam Deck.\"",

I have never been a PC gamer, more of a console person, but I saw some videos on the Steam Deck and its versatility in games, and the possibilities of gaming around the house and other places seem awesome. \n\nMy question is as follows: I have a small motoric impairment in my right hand, which has made me look into different controllers in the past. Eventually, I really liked the Xbox 360 controller, and I could play well enough. Now I understand that the Steam Deck can cause cramps in some people's hands during long gaming sessions, and I was wondering about your experiences with this. As I live in Europe and their is not really a placee to try out a deck in a store to feel how its configuration works for my hands.   \n  \nAny advice on this?? thank you!  ",

    "selftext": "Issue: Battery stuck at 0 and isnt charging at all. Unplugging just shuts down the deck (LCD) immediately so I can’t recalibrate thru letting it die in BIOS.\n\nHad to replace the og battery because it was already in its “spicy” phase. Ordered a Getac one and replaced it. \n\nThings I’ve done: \n1. Upon removing the og battery, I tried running the deck thru the charger. Charger plugged, no battery. Tested some light games Ni No Kuni 2 and some Emulation with Unicorn Overlord. With the charger plugged, it would power down especially when game gets heavy or theres too much going on. This happened around 5-10 times. Then I limited the TDP to 10 and the shut downs stopped. (Again this is with charger plugged ONLY and no battery) \n\n2. When I received the new battery, immediately hooked it up and booted the deck. 37% and CHARGING but the battery had a “h? m?” So i figured I needed to calibrate it. Had it drained fully but then it never came up again. I think I messed up by letting it drain down to 0.\n\n3. Tried removing the battery pin, let it sit a while and reconnect it. \n\n4. Tried leaving it on charge both ON and OFF on separate days and even charged it while pn desktop mode. \n\n5. Followed the battery storage mode instructions and even the “minus volume button + “…” + “Power”. Basically almost all the previous posts in the thread. ;(\n\n6. Tried different chargers, both 65w and lower.  \n-used the og charger eversince. Og Charger can charge other devices without issues soI doubt its the problem. \n\nQuestions: \n1. Idk if 5.90 V (2nd pic) is normal but from what I’ve seen from other screenshots, it seems the voltage is too low? Is this normal? \n\n2. Is there a tool/device that electronic repair shops could tell which has an issue? Like can they check if my type c port is faulty or is it the battery?\n\nCan't reach out to Valve for repair since I'm in SEAsia and the deck (LCD) was bought in 2023.",

I recently moved and now my TV is in the living room and PC is in the office.  I kind of got used to playing my PC on my couch and find it hard to go back to the computer desk for a lot of games.\n\nI was thinking of moving my PC to my living room but then I would lose the desktop setup for other games (FPS etc)  I saw that the Steam Deck has a dock which connects to HDMI which might be the solution I'm looking for.  While I like the portability of the Deck, I'm wondering if I can just use it as an access point to my PC and connect it to the TV while using controller or mouse and keyboard to game from my living room (basically using it as a replacement for Big Picture Mode). \n\nWould the Steam Deck be worth the price if I mainly use it docked to stream my PC to my TV?  I'm afraid of the latency while playing over a wifi network as well as upscaling the resolution to 1440 or 4k.  I feel like this would be a considerable downgrade from using the TV as a monitor but maybe I'm wrong?  Does anyone else use their Deck this way?\n\nThanks!",

I looked up fixes and nothing seems to work. I put 7 hours into this game doing all the tedious side stuff and whatnot in order to get all the items, I really, REALLY do not want go through all that again. Can anyone help please?",

I need to know what could’ve even caused this?\n\nLast time I used it I shut steam OS down properly, I booted into windows 11 using my boot manager and shut windows 11 down. I’ve heard things that windows update can attempt to overwrite other partitions on your drive which can corrupt steamOS and trigger a reset. I’m not sure if that was my issue though, funnily enough windows 11 is still working fine. In fact it sometimes directly boots into it and ignores the boot screen, not all the time though.\n\nSo is this a windows 11 thing? If it is then it’s completely unacceptable from Microsoft and makes the OS unusable. I’m just annoyed I’ll now have to boot into recovery and sort the partitions out again. Has anyone experienced this issue? It’s been working fine for a good week or so.\n\nAlso side note, can I recover deleted files in steamOS? I know you can do it on windows using recuvra and such. I was playing dark souls 2 before the steamOS reset and it doesn’t support steam cloud.\nCan I retrieve these save files? I’m not using the OS at the moment incase I overwrite those deleted files.",

Eventually, I really liked the Xbox 360 controller, and I could play well enough. Now I understand that the Steam Deck can cause cramps in some people's hands during long gaming sessions, and I was wondering about your experiences with this. As I live in Europe and their is not really a placee to try out a deck in a store to feel how its configuration works for my hands.   \n  \nAny advice on this?? thank you!  ",

Unplugging just shuts down the deck (LCD) immediately so I can’t recalibrate thru letting it die in BIOS.\n\nHad to replace the og battery because it was already in its “spicy” phase. Ordered a Getac one and replaced it. \n\nThings I’ve done: \n1. Upon removing the og battery, I tried running the deck thru the charger. Charger plugged, no battery. Tested some light games Ni No Kuni 2 and some Emulation with Unicorn Overlord. With the charger plugged, it would power down especially when game gets heavy or theres too much going on. This happened around 5-10 times. Then I limited the TDP to 10 and the shut downs stopped. (Again this is with charger plugged ONLY and no battery) \n\n2. When I received the new battery, immediately hooked it up and booted the deck. 37% and CHARGING but the battery had a “h? m?” So i figured I needed to calibrate it. Had it drained fully but then it never came up again. I think I messed up by letting it drain down to 0.\n\n3. Tried removing the battery pin, let it sit a while and reconnect it. \n\n4. Tried leaving it on charge both ON and OFF on separate days and even charged it while pn desktop mode. \n\n5. Followed the battery storage mode instructions and even the “minus volume button + “…” + “Power”. Basically almost all the previous posts in the thread. ;(\n\n6. Tried different chargers, both 65w and lower.  \n-used the og charger eversince. Og Charger can charge other devices without issues soI doubt its the problem. \n\nQuestions: \n1. Idk if 5.90 V (2nd pic) is normal but from what I’ve seen from other screenshots, it seems the voltage is too low? Is this normal? \n\n2. Is there a tool/device that electronic repair shops could tell which has an issue? Like can they check if my type c port is faulty or is it the battery?\n\nCan't reach out to Valve for repair since I'm in SEAsia and the deck (LCD) was bought in 2023.",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

What if someone hacks the cameral, etc.\n\nI initially thought it was a joke, but I found the product on the Kohler site ([Dekoda - Tracker & Waste Analyzer](https://www.kohlerhealth.com/dekoda/)) and apparently this is a serious piece of equipment; it's not cheap either at $600.\n\nI love home automation with my full Ubiquiti setup including cameras, WiFi switches, outlets, locks, etc., but I don't think I am ready to install a \"poo cam\".",

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

Props to them for doing the right thing. They not only created a solid product but they also made sure that the end user would be able to use the product without having to buy another battery from zooz. \n\nI know it’s stupid but this has made a loyal customer out of me and I deeply respect this company. \n",

The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather). The fingerprint access is the reason I bought them at the time, and it rarely works (even when I reprogram the lock, it forgets my prints in a week or two).

I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

    "selftext": "Christmas post… thinking about it already! I’m looking for a compact smart plug that sits between an outlet and a device. When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working on a project where I need to take gas pressure readings from four different locations and record them at intervals of 2-5 seconds.\n\nI initially looked for gas pressure transmitters and data loggers that can handle 4-20 mA signals, but I couldn't find a suitable one locally. Ordering from abroad would take months and be quite expensive.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about using four regular digital pressure gauges instead. My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

They are IP65 bulbs for outdoor use but the dimmer will be indoor. These light bulbs are not listed as dimmable but other buyers noted they bought a separate dimmer to go with them. They are warm white with color temperature of 4700 Kelvins but I find them too bright for garden mood lighting. I read online that I need to consider the total wattage that the dimmer will support (e.g. if  I have two strings connected together I would need a dimmer that can support: 60 bulbs x 7 watts each bulb= total 420 watts) and that it's compatible with the listed 31 voltage, right? Could you point me to a dimmer available in Europe (the Netherlands) hopefully?",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Help identifying Danfoss radiator valve types + correct adapters for tado X (Denmark, district heating)",
    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

They are IP65 bulbs for outdoor use but the dimmer will be indoor. These light bulbs are not listed as dimmable but other buyers noted they bought a separate dimmer to go with them. They are warm white with color temperature of 4700 Kelvins but I find them too bright for garden mood lighting. I read online that I need to consider the total wattage that the dimmer will support (e.g. if  I have two strings connected together I would need a dimmer that can support: 60 bulbs x 7 watts each bulb= total 420 watts) and that it's compatible with the listed 31 voltage, right? Could you point me to a dimmer available in Europe (the Netherlands) hopefully?",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

I’d like to replace the system with a fingerprint reader instead. I know it’s not the most secure option, but honestly, having a remote lying around in the driveway isn’t great either.\n\nI’m looking for a simple, weather-resistant (lots of rain) fingerprint reader that can be managed directly on the device, via a web interface, or through an app. Ideally, it should also integrate with Home Assistant.\n\nThere are a lot of Chinese models on the market, but it’s hard to tell which ones are reliable. I’ve looked into Anviz. The P7 is still available locally but seems to be EOL, and the C2 Slim appears to be out of stock everywhere.\n\nDoes anyone have other suggestions or recommendations for specific models?\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

And use AAA batteries not the lithium ones the Samsung sensors require. \n\nI also am using Google home and have downloaded the app. And it is integrated. I just need to buy the devices. Any reviews from anyone using these in their home ? \n\nLink provided in case you’re are curious.

    "selftext": "Is or has anyone else thought about doing this? Has anyone done it successfully? \n\nI'd like parts of my home to have lights turn on ONLY when there is a person detected. Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

It's basically like this one: [https://gainesmfg.com/products/classic-pedestal-mailbox](https://gainesmfg.com/products/classic-pedestal-mailbox)\n\nMy solution was to use a wired contact sensor inside to trigger on the flap opening, with the wires snaking out the bottom and a smart sensor that supports dry contacts (external sensor) mounted underneath so the signal will work.\n\nI had previously used an Ecolink Door/Window sensor, and then the Aeotec Door/Window Sensor 7 Pro when the Ecolink failed. Unfortunately, after a few years, the Aeotec has now died and it's discontinued.\n\nSo, does anyone know a good smart sensor with the following features?\n\n* Battery powered\n* Z-Wave or Zigbee (no WiFi or BT)\n* Supports connecting an external sensor\n* Preferably resistant to the weather\n* US $50 or less if possible\n* No more than about 1/2in (1.3cm) on one dimension so I can mount it\n\nI'm located in the US, so I'd like to use a US-based seller so I don't need to navigate the whole import mess currently going on.",

They say they’re aware some iPhone users can no longer pair their phones to the sockets. Android phones seem unaffected.

I saw that the company shut down or something like that. I have zero interest in any complicated set ups to make it work again so I'm looking to replace them. What are some good budget replacements? Something bright but it doesn't have to be crazy. RGB isn't necessary but I did enjoy switching to red lights whenever I felt overstimulated. ㅤNeed 4. \n\nI loved the simple operation of the Sengled bulbs being controlled from my phone with Google Assistant or through the app. \n\n2. Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up? Something without a subscription.\n\n  \nAdded request - We're using a really old camera system. I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription. I don't live in the US and spending USD adds up really quick with forex limits.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nPS. If there's a better community for me to ask these things, feel free to scold me and send me on my way.",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

I have cruised youtube and the google and have not found what I'm lookin for yet, i dont think.

Any suggestions?\n\nI’ve read quite a few reviews saying Aqara can be hit-or-miss in smart setups (lag, stability, hub quirks). I’m open to solid alternatives available in Europe (EU versions).

I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

I've found sets that will tilt horizontal blinds (these blinds don't have the twist rod), and others that will open curtains by running a motor across the top pole, but I can't seem to find any that are set up to pull the cords to open a standard set of blinds.

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI have a garage door that can be opened using either a remote or a PIN code. Unfortunately, my kids often forget their PIN or lose their remote. I’d like to replace the system with a fingerprint reader instead. I know it’s not the most secure option, but honestly, having a remote lying around in the driveway isn’t great either.\n\nI’m looking for a simple, weather-resistant (lots of rain) fingerprint reader that can be managed directly on the device, via a web interface, or through an app. Ideally, it should also integrate with Home Assistant.\n\nThere are a lot of Chinese models on the market, but it’s hard to tell which ones are reliable. I’ve looked into Anviz. The P7 is still available locally but seems to be EOL, and the C2 Slim appears to be out of stock everywhere.\n\nDoes anyone have other suggestions or recommendations for specific models?\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

My previous attempt caused a major system failure, and even after a clean Windows reinstall and enabling related BIOS/UEFI settings, HVCI still won't stay enabled after restarts. \n\n**Background**: I received a notice from Valorant stating that I must enable HVCI to continue playing. On Monday, I attempted to enable HVCI for the first time. This completely broke my PC (it became unusable), forcing me to perform a clean install of Windows on the affected drive.\n\n**Steps I've Taken Post-Reinstall**: \n\nReset my system and entered the BIOS/UEFI settings.\n\n Enabled the following features: \n\nUEFI mode Secure Boot \n\nTPM 2.0 \n\nIOMMU \n\n Attempted to enable HVCI again via Windows settings (Core Isolation > Memory Integrity).\n\n**Current Problem**: When I toggle HVCI on, Windows prompts me to restart the PC. During the restart: The first boot attempt hangs at the loading dots/circle (it stops spinning and freezes). The system automatically retries, and it successfully boots on the second attempt. However, once booted, HVCI is not actually enabled—it's reverted back to the \"off\" state, as if the change never took effect.",

Although I am not open to doing any of the former, email strikes my interest. May anyone tell me their experience using email verification and if it is invasive or not? What will happen if it fails?\n\nAdditionally, I've considered making this account a \"teen\" account and just using another account for \"family link.\" Is this a good option? Has anyone tried this?\n\nIf I'm not able to prove I am an adult, how do I change my log-ins on 100+ websites to a new email, and how do I ensure that all emails on my old email that I receive are transferred to the new email? Has anyone done this in an efficient way and is it possible?\n\nI've heard that some users used a VPN to bypass this, however I am hesitant because I'm worried that some websites will stop working for me. If I do resort to this option, what country is best to pick?\n\nAlso, is there any way to convert slides to powerpoints/canvas? I use interactive slides frequently and would like to continue using them, even if I stop using google.\n\nThank you all for the help.\n\nTLDR: Got flagged under 18 and searching for the least invasive ways to keep my gmail/google account.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, before explaining the issue, I already checked several Reddit posts with similar cases to mine, but I couldn’t find a solution.\n\nA few days ago, I finished building a PC (I'll list the components below). The main issue is that when using different software tools to monitor CPU temperatures (HWMonitor, Afterburner, and Armoury Crate), they all show slightly different and unstable readings — especially HWMonitor.\n\nTemperatures jump from 30°C to 35°C to 29°C, then spike to 45°C and drop back to 30°C, without ever giving a consistent or accurate reading. This happens with no programs running, and CPU usage stays between 1% and 10%. In-game (according to Afterburner), temps never go above 65°C.\n\nIs this normal? Could it be due to the software? Can I consider this safe, or might there be some hardware issue?\n\nIn the BIOS (which is updated to the latest version, along with the chipset), the temperatures remain stable at 28–29°C. I haven’t done any overclocking, and I’ve even disabled XMP. I was thinking about undervolting the CPU (?)\n\nThe CPU is an i5-14600K cooled by a 360mm AIO, motherboard is an ASUS Prime Z790-P WiFi, GPU is an RTX 5070, and RAM is 2x16GB DDR5.",

    "selftext": "My laptop is able to connect (“connected, secure”) to my wifi but the internet has stopped working and says “no internet” in the browser. The Internet/wifi works on my iPhone. The issues on my laptop progressively got worse because initially I was able to access certain networks but just not ones that had a webpage sign in. And then I was not able to access Wi-Fi at all but still able to use my hotspot. Now I am not even able to  connect to the Internet through my hotspot. Again, like with Wi-Fi, it does connect to the hotspot, but it always says no internet in the browser. I have been traveling so this is not just an issue on this Wi-Fi network but multiple Wi-Fi networks so I know it’s not a problem with my ISP.\n\nI have tried every single troubleshooting step I could find including making the WLAN automatic, doing a full network reset, entering dozens of prompts in to command to reset and reconfigure the DNS and IP, etc., and resetting and uninstalling my WiFi driver. The windows troubleshooting tells me that there’s no problems with the Internet whatsoever. \n\nThe only thing I haven’t done is transfer the manufacturers driver‘s manually from my phone to my laptop. I’ve already downloaded it from Intel, but it seems like a huge pain to sift through the phone files to find it so I will hold off on doing that unless one of you says it’s likely to help. I also have not done a full reset of my computer because I do not want to have to reinstall all of my applications. But again, obviously I would do that if that is the only option.\n\nI suspect that it may have to do with me trying to troubleshoot issues the MSFT connect test log in page not loading. I started entering command prompts to flush the DNS. I don’t know why the issues just got worse and worse from there.\n\nAnyways, please, please help I am willing to provide any further information or screenshots. ",

Updated a couple of games on Steam, closed everything down properly and shut the system down before heading to bed. Got up this morning and booted up to find I had been directed to the Automatic Repair page quoting \"Your PC did not start correctly\", with the options \"restart\" and \"advanced options\". I've been here before and got things fixed. However, on this occasion, my keyboard and mouse aren't being recognised by the system wirelessly or wired. I have tried rebooting the system with them connected in a multitude of ports and of course wirelessly to no avail. \n\n  \nI do not at present have access to a USB stick with a Windows install on it and have no other systems available to me currently to make one and reinstall Windows from that. I have a MacBook but it's all USB-C. \n\n  \nLeading on to my question, does anyone know how to get around this? I would consider it a bit of an inconvenience to reinstall Windows as the games I play are somewhat large (100GB+) and I have a number of other things on the system I would prefer not to lose (albeit none of these would be life-changing to lose). \n\n  \nMy system specs - 7800X3D, 4080 FE, 2X 24GB DDR5 Crucial Pro 5600mhz sticks, 2X 2TB Samsung 980 Pros in a Fractal Terra. \n\n  \nI have tried the following to no success - \n\nResetting CMOS (button present on the motherboard).\n\nConnecting keyboard and mouse wirelessly and wired.\n\nTried a separate keyboard and mouse (wired only).\n\nTried resetting BIOS (was essentially untouched prior to this anyway).\n\n  \nGenuinely, I'm at a loss for what to do. In the process of creating this post, I have had an offer of a laptop from a friend after work today to create a Windows reinstall on a USB so that option is now available to me later, albeit I'd like to avoid this where possible. \n\n  \nThank you in advance to any/all of you for any guidance, I appreciate that I may be overlooking a blatantly obvious solution and can only apologise if this is the case, thanks again!\n\n  \n\n\n  \n",

    "title": "[Help/Discussion] Lenovo Flex 5 BSODs whenever charging on Windows 11, but totally fine on Linux Mint",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!  \nI’m new to this community, and I wanted to share something odd that’s been happening with my laptop.  \nI’ve been troubleshooting this issue for a while — and decided to document everything with the help of ChatGPT to make sure I didn’t miss anything technical.\n\nMaybe someone here has seen something similar or can help me figure out what’s really going on.\n\n\n\n# 💻 My setup\n\n* **Laptop:** Lenovo Flex 5 14IAU7 (Intel i3 12th)\n* **OS (before):** Windows 11 Pro (23H2, also tried reinstalling with 24H2 ISO)\n* **Current test OS:** Linux Mint Cinnamon 22\n\n\n\n# ⚠️ What happened\n\nA few weeks ago, my laptop suddenly **BSOD-ed (Blue Screen of Death)** during a Windows Update while it was **plugged in and charging**.  \nAfter that, Windows refused to boot.\n\nI tried reinstalling Windows three separate times, all clean installs.  \nEvery time, it worked fine at first — but as soon as I plugged in the charger, it **crashed again** within seconds.\n\nWhen I used it on **battery only**, everything was stable.  \nNo lag, no crashes, no overheating.\n\n\n\n# 📊 What I found\n\nRight after a fresh Windows install, I opened **HWMonitor** and took a screenshot (attached below).  \nTemperatures looked normal — around **30–40°C** while running on battery.\n\nBut the moment I plugged in the charger, CPU package temperature would **instantly spike to around 96°C**, and then the system crashed (BSOD).  \nUnplugging would stop the spike.\n\nAt that point, I wasn’t sure whether it was:\n\n* Bad or dried **thermal paste**\n* A **power delivery issue (IC/VRM)** on the motherboard\n* Or a **software/driver issue** with Windows itself\n\n\n\n# 🐧 Testing with Linux Mint\n\nTo rule out hardware failure, I installed **Linux Mint Cinnamon** on the same SSD.  \nSurprisingly, Linux runs perfectly — even when charging.  \nI watched movies, did stress tests, used it for hours, and everything stayed stable.  \nNo overheating, no crash, no kernel panic.\n\n\n\n# 🤔 Current conclusion (so far)\n\nThis makes me think it’s **not hardware-related**, since Linux handles charging and temperature normally.  \nSo far, my best guess is that something in **Windows 11’s power management** (maybe Intel DPTF or ACPI behavior) is causing it,  \nbut I can’t be completely sure yet.\n\n\n\n# 📸 Additional info\n\n* Attached: HWMonitor screenshot (taken on Windows, before charging) *Temps were normal before plugging in; they spiked instantly when charging started.*\n* The text of this post was written with the help of GPT, since I’ve been documenting my troubleshooting process step by step with it.\n\n\n\nI’m curious if anyone else with a Lenovo Flex or Intel laptop has experienced something similar —  \nBSOD or temperature spikes only when charging under Windows 11 —  \nand if you found what the actual root cause was.\n\nAny insight or experience would be really appreciated!",

But basically as soon as I launch the game, the audio becomes choppy and then the quality drops and its hissing/buzzing but at very low frequency. \n\nI checked a couple other games and this issue is the same a cross all of them.

    "title": "Flickering transparent textures and fog for years now",
    "selftext": "So, for years now (like, 5 years), I've had horrible flickering in a handful of games:\n\n* WoW (a specific fog effect in one of the new dungeons)\n* New World (in one of the dungeons and a specific area, video at the bottom)\n* League of Legends (when hextech rift spawns, several large square areas, like a tile, start flickering, this is the longest running issue)\n* Helldivers 2 (the console for picking a level will flicker like crazy)\n* Palworld (any time fog is on the screen the fog just goes crazy) and etc.\n* Terraria (Using a mod that makes depth-based lighting, if light shines through water then the water (or light, I can't tell) will flicker slightly. This is the least obnoxious one.\n\nMany games don't have any issues or flickering of any kind, even in foggy areas, but then some games are just horrible to the point of being unplayable.\n\nWhat happens is that certain volumetric fog effects or other transparent textures seem to cause flickering when looking through it, causing the brightness of whatever's behind the transparent texture (be it fog or otherwise) to go from super dark to super bright super quickly. It's like a strobe light. \n\nIn WoW, the fog itself blinks in and out of existence super quickly. \n\nBoth versions of flickering are significant enough to give me a headache, and can make me feel sick in some games. It's not random artifacting, and doesn't happen all over the game, only in specific spots, and very reliably.\n\n---\n\nIn WoW I can turn off \"compute effects\" and the flickering will totally go away as the fog clouds no longer exist.\n\n~~In League, I can get \"Environment Quality\" to low or very low, and the flickering goes away entirely, though I can still see the \"seams\" of the tiles that flicker and weird artifacting in the area, and if I have some kind of lighting effect near me, like Milio's backpack or blue wards, the flickering happens in said lighting.~~ **As of the map update this no longer works. Now flickers anywhere a glow effect is on the map, and in certain spots on the map it flickers no matter what as I move my camera.**\n\n**Update 10/13/25** League now flickers anywhere a blue ward is placed (they generate fog around them). If I set my FPS at 30 or below, the flickering goes away.\n\n**Update 10/22/25** New World flickers anywhere with fog and a light of bright light in said fog. There's also new Arcana cards that flicker horribly around them. Will attach a video. \n\n**Update 10/22/25** While playing around with settings in League, I noticed that if I cap my FPS at 30 or below, the flickering seems to go away, or is at least greatly diminished to the point I can't really notice it. Does not do anything in other games though.\n\nIn New World, there's nothing I've done that fixes it. Same goes for Helldivers and Palworld.\n\nIn Terraria, turning on the \"frame skip\" option significantly reduced flickering, but didn't totally eliminate it.\n\n---\n\nI've tried all sorts of things to try and fix it, including:\n\n* Cleaning and reseating all my cables and hardware\n* Using DDU countless times to uninstall and reinstall drivers, with and without Adrenalin\n* Using SFC and DISM to check for problems with Windows itself.\n* Turning off hardware acceleration in Windows\n* ~~Turning everything off in Adrenalin, or setting to \"use application settings\" (I tried turning everything ON too)~~ Now running Nvidia, issue remains despite playing with settings the same way.\n* Turning off variable refresh rates, variable FPS, variable everything.\n* Capping FPS to my monitor's refresh rate.\n* Reinstalling Windows (at one point I even got a totally new HDD, and partitioned it and installed Windows totally fresh).\n* Changing games to run in older DX modes\n* Running games in admin, changing compatibility modes, etc.\n* Stress tested hardware to find no issues.\n* Disabled MPO\n* Disabled HPET\n* As of this issue first starting, I have replaced my entire computer, did not transfer data or any parts whatsoever, and the issue still persists.\n* Put my computer on a different power circuit in the house\n* Plugged all my stuff into a $500 power conditioner since some people suggested it could be dirty power\n* Doing a clean install with ONLY my monitor, keyboard and mouse plugged in\n* Rolling back to older drivers that people say are more stable (In this case, 535.48)\n* ...\n\n\n~~Since the issue has started happening, I've replaced every piece of hardware in my PC, even the PSU. The only piece I haven't replaced is the motherboard (using an old prebuilt that I've upgraded over the years)~~\n\n**As of 5 months ago, I got an entirely new computer, did not save any hardware, did not transfer any data outside of my folder full of art stuff (only images and Clip Studio files, nothing that could cause issues like this).**\n\n---\n\nRunning on: \n\n* ~~B350M Bazooka (using latest BIOS), Ryzen 5 5600, Radeon RX 6600, 32GB of DDR4 at 2667MHz, 1000W PSU.~~ Last machine, no longer have\n\n* **Current machine: ASROCK B550M-C (updated BIOS), R7 5700X, RTX 4060 (running latest game ready driver as of writing), 48GB of DDR4 @ 3GHz.**\n\n---\n\nBelow I'll attach some screenshots and a couple videos.\n\n* https://imgur.com/a/VRI5tLL - If you look at the texture of the floor (League), you can see the top half has a weird grid pattern on it. When I move around in the game, the grid pattern will sometimes clip through the normal texture and back out, which seems to be what causes the flicker (though I don't know for sure). If I stand still, there's no flicker, but this weird artifacting is present.\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/z22hrh/recorded\\_a\\_video\\_of\\_the\\_fun\\_flickering\\_that/ - This is a video from New World several months back, where the flickering is the worst. It only happens in two spots in the game, and it happens very reliably.\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuOQeIVr8\\_I - This is a video from League, where the issue has been going on the longest. If you look at the floor as I walk around, you can see the shadows in the texture flickering like crazy (make sure to set the video to HD, or you can't see it at all). If I stop moving, or move out of the square \"tile\" then there's no flickering at all. There are a handful of tiles that flicker, and also the steps leading into each team's base (dark shadows, maybe that's part of it). This only happens when the hextech rift (changes the map a bit, adds particle and light effects) triggers. Other map changes have no issues at all, only this one. This now happens everywhere with a \"glow\" effect, and happens no matter what in both team's bases.\n\n* https://youtu.be/wNmXzyWW7vI - Flickering in Palworld in fog after they updated the game to display fog properly. Everything freaks out since the fog is all around your character.\n\n* https://youtu.be/ETJmDKPEoG4 flickering in WoW, only happens in these dust clouds that roll through. If I disable fog entirely, the flickering goes away.\n\n* https://youtu.be/zhcd6EV3SYc New flickering in New World\n\n---\n\nAnyone have any ideas? It's really obnoxious, and it's been going on for years now, despite getting an entirely new computer.",

Black Screen 101 error code, restarted fine, no issues for 2 days. \n\nYesterday however I experienced 2 crashes in one day playing different applications. Once around 11am playing VR and another around 6pm playing WoW. Unfortunately the dmp files aren't accessible, and for whatever reason are missing. Furthermore I had another crash this morning a 10:29.\n\nFor this mornings crash I looked at Event viewer and found 2155 Errors in regards to: Session \"OculusVadApoEventTrace\" failed to start with the following error: 0xC0000035\n\nI also have warning everyday about: Windows Hello for Business provisioning will not be launched. \n\nI've currently only done sfc/scannow and tried some hardware updates if any are available. \n\n  \nOperating System: Windows 11 Home 64-bit\n\nCPU: Intel Core i9 11900K @ 3.50GHz 47 °C\n\nRAM: 32.0GB Dual-Channel DDR4 @ 1600MHz (16-20-20-38)\n\nMotherboard: ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.

At the beginning of this year friends apartment got robbed where bunch of his family stuff has been taken like electronic devices, tools, etc. He reported everything to police and among other things stolen there was PC which was barely few months old,and it had serial numbers which he turned over to police I really was thinking it's gonna be an easy find.\n\nBut.... It has been over half a year aaaaaaaannnnd.... Still nothing....  \nI can't keep asking myself how is that possible, considering that the moment you connect that PC to the internet it should leave some trace, and I highly doubt it's not being connected to the internet since it was like a decent PC which costs over 1000 Euros, even if you disassemble into parts surely it should be a possible to trace it.\n\n\n\nAlso can somebody recommend or know some sites who are selling used IT components which shipping inside Europe?  \nSince more than likely cops ain't  gonna solve nothing, couple of us were planning to chip up 10-20 euros each and potentially buy them some kind of entry-level PC since they have children which are going to school.\n\nComponents at my place are diabolically expensive, people are asking some mad prices for second-hand hardware.  \nI know about computerstoreberlin site, but even there hardware is maybe 5-10 Euros cheaper than brand new one in the store... Just doesn't make any sense, and it's not that we are looking for some kind of insane PC, just some average older am4 platform it can be used for minimal things.\n\nIf somebody knows site like that with shipping inside EU please let me know.\n\nThanks",

I had 2 monitors one plugged into my motherboard 1 in my gpu, both boot up fine at 1080p but my gpu itself is not recognized when I go to my display settings just my integrated graphics. The gpu doesnt look like theres any damage whatsoever. I have no idea how to fix this.\n\nCPU: Radeon 7900x\n\nGPU: 7900xtx\n\n  \nEDIT: If this happens to anyone else. These were the steps I took after some help with the people below. 1. Turn off power and unplug from wall 2. unhook gpu, inspect gpu for damage and check the PCI-e slot as well for damage then re seat it 3. boot it up see if your gpu is recognized in device manager (DO NOT LOOK FOR IT IN DISPLAY SETTINGS) if it appears thats good news 4. windows may have disabled it so re enable it and see if it appears in your display settings if not re install the drivers and bada bing bada boom it should work. This is just what I did it may be different for you. Worst case scenario take it to a computer shop before you buy a new.",

    "selftext": "I'm in an absolute nightmare situation and I'm desperate for advice.\nMy friend just contacted me. They discovered that my phone number is listed as a verified phone number on their Google account.\nI have 1000% no idea how it got there. I never accessed their account, I don't know their password, I would never, ever do that.\nNow, they are accusing me of hacking them and trying to steal their account. They are not listening to any of my explanations and are treating me like a criminal. I've tried to explain that for my number to be added, someone would have needed a 6-digit verification code that Google would have sent to my phone. I never received a code like that, and I definitely never gave one to anyone.\nThey are not accepting this fact and are convinced I'm lying.\nI'm at a total loss. I'm being accused of something I didn't do.\nI have two main questions:\n * How is this technically possible? Could their account have been hacked by a real hacker who, for some bizarre reason, used my phone number? How would that hacker have gotten the verification code from my phone?\n * How can I prove my innocence? I've asked my friend to check their account's security activity (like the \"Details\" link at the bottom of Gmail) which should show the IP address and device that made the change. They are either too freaked out to do it or don't believe me. Is there any way for me to prove it wasn't me?\nWhat do I do now?\nTL;DR: My phone number is on my friend's Google account. I didn't put it there. They are accusing me of hacking them and won't listen to reason. How can I prove I'm innocent?",

    "selftext": "Hey people, as the title may suggest, I have run into somewhat of an issue, and for the life of me, I cannot seem to find a solution, hence my reaching out for help.\n\n  \nLast night I updated my pc (whatever the latest Windows update was), took approximately 40 minutes, completed the update, and logged in, dandy, or so I thought. Updated a couple of games on Steam, closed everything down properly and shut the system down before heading to bed. Got up this morning and booted up to find I had been directed to the Automatic Repair page quoting \"Your PC did not start correctly\", with the options \"restart\" and \"advanced options\". I've been here before and got things fixed. However, on this occasion, my keyboard and mouse aren't being recognised by the system wirelessly or wired. I have tried rebooting the system with them connected in a multitude of ports and of course wirelessly to no avail. \n\n  \nI do not at present have access to a USB stick with a Windows install on it and have no other systems available to me currently to make one and reinstall Windows from that. I have a MacBook but it's all USB-C. \n\n  \nLeading on to my question, does anyone know how to get around this? I would consider it a bit of an inconvenience to reinstall Windows as the games I play are somewhat large (100GB+) and I have a number of other things on the system I would prefer not to lose (albeit none of these would be life-changing to lose). \n\n  \nMy system specs - 7800X3D, 4080 FE, 2X 24GB DDR5 Crucial Pro 5600mhz sticks, 2X 2TB Samsung 980 Pros in a Fractal Terra. \n\n  \nI have tried the following to no success - \n\nResetting CMOS (button present on the motherboard).\n\nConnecting keyboard and mouse wirelessly and wired.\n\nTried a separate keyboard and mouse (wired only).\n\nTried resetting BIOS (was essentially untouched prior to this anyway).\n\n  \nGenuinely, I'm at a loss for what to do. In the process of creating this post, I have had an offer of a laptop from a friend after work today to create a Windows reinstall on a USB so that option is now available to me later, albeit I'd like to avoid this where possible. \n\n  \nThank you in advance to any/all of you for any guidance, I appreciate that I may be overlooking a blatantly obvious solution and can only apologise if this is the case, thanks again!\n\n  \n\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Recently, I saw a pop-up stating that google identified my account as \"we couldn't verify you're an adult.\" I did some more digging and verified that it was actually google, and not a scam.\n\nIt says my account will be disabled in 14 days. Can I still use it after it is disabled?\n\nAlso, when it asks me to verify, it shows id, face, credit card, and email options. Although I am not open to doing any of the former, email strikes my interest. May anyone tell me their experience using email verification and if it is invasive or not? What will happen if it fails?\n\nAdditionally, I've considered making this account a \"teen\" account and just using another account for \"family link.\" Is this a good option? Has anyone tried this?\n\nIf I'm not able to prove I am an adult, how do I change my log-ins on 100+ websites to a new email, and how do I ensure that all emails on my old email that I receive are transferred to the new email? Has anyone done this in an efficient way and is it possible?\n\nI've heard that some users used a VPN to bypass this, however I am hesitant because I'm worried that some websites will stop working for me. If I do resort to this option, what country is best to pick?\n\nAlso, is there any way to convert slides to powerpoints/canvas? I use interactive slides frequently and would like to continue using them, even if I stop using google.\n\nThank you all for the help.\n\nTLDR: Got flagged under 18 and searching for the least invasive ways to keep my gmail/google account.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, before explaining the issue, I already checked several Reddit posts with similar cases to mine, but I couldn’t find a solution.\n\nA few days ago, I finished building a PC (I'll list the components below). The main issue is that when using different software tools to monitor CPU temperatures (HWMonitor, Afterburner, and Armoury Crate), they all show slightly different and unstable readings — especially HWMonitor.\n\nTemperatures jump from 30°C to 35°C to 29°C, then spike to 45°C and drop back to 30°C, without ever giving a consistent or accurate reading. This happens with no programs running, and CPU usage stays between 1% and 10%. In-game (according to Afterburner), temps never go above 65°C.\n\nIs this normal? Could it be due to the software? Can I consider this safe, or might there be some hardware issue?\n\nIn the BIOS (which is updated to the latest version, along with the chipset), the temperatures remain stable at 28–29°C. I haven’t done any overclocking, and I’ve even disabled XMP. I was thinking about undervolting the CPU (?)\n\nThe CPU is an i5-14600K cooled by a 360mm AIO, motherboard is an ASUS Prime Z790-P WiFi, GPU is an RTX 5070, and RAM is 2x16GB DDR5.",

Again, like with Wi-Fi, it does connect to the hotspot, but it always says no internet in the browser. I have been traveling so this is not just an issue on this Wi-Fi network but multiple Wi-Fi networks so I know it’s not a problem with my ISP.\n\nI have tried every single troubleshooting step I could find including making the WLAN automatic, doing a full network reset, entering dozens of prompts in to command to reset and reconfigure the DNS and IP, etc., and resetting and uninstalling my WiFi driver. The windows troubleshooting tells me that there’s no problems with the Internet whatsoever. \n\nThe only thing I haven’t done is transfer the manufacturers driver‘s manually from my phone to my laptop. I’ve already downloaded it from Intel, but it seems like a huge pain to sift through the phone files to find it so I will hold off on doing that unless one of you says it’s likely to help. I also have not done a full reset of my computer because I do not want to have to reinstall all of my applications. But again, obviously I would do that if that is the only option.\n\nI suspect that it may have to do with me trying to troubleshoot issues the MSFT connect test log in page not loading. I started entering command prompts to flush the DNS. I don’t know why the issues just got worse and worse from there.\n\nAnyways, please, please help I am willing to provide any further information or screenshots. ",

Updated a couple of games on Steam, closed everything down properly and shut the system down before heading to bed. Got up this morning and booted up to find I had been directed to the Automatic Repair page quoting \"Your PC did not start correctly\", with the options \"restart\" and \"advanced options\". I've been here before and got things fixed. However, on this occasion, my keyboard and mouse aren't being recognised by the system wirelessly or wired. I have tried rebooting the system with them connected in a multitude of ports and of course wirelessly to no avail. \n\n  \nI do not at present have access to a USB stick with a Windows install on it and have no other systems available to me currently to make one and reinstall Windows from that. I have a MacBook but it's all USB-C. \n\n  \nLeading on to my question, does anyone know how to get around this? I would consider it a bit of an inconvenience to reinstall Windows as the games I play are somewhat large (100GB+) and I have a number of other things on the system I would prefer not to lose (albeit none of these would be life-changing to lose). \n\n  \nMy system specs - 7800X3D, 4080 FE, 2X 24GB DDR5 Crucial Pro 5600mhz sticks, 2X 2TB Samsung 980 Pros in a Fractal Terra. \n\n  \nI have tried the following to no success - \n\nResetting CMOS (button present on the motherboard).\n\nConnecting keyboard and mouse wirelessly and wired.\n\nTried a separate keyboard and mouse (wired only).\n\nTried resetting BIOS (was essentially untouched prior to this anyway).\n\n  \nGenuinely, I'm at a loss for what to do. In the process of creating this post, I have had an offer of a laptop from a friend after work today to create a Windows reinstall on a USB so that option is now available to me later, albeit I'd like to avoid this where possible. \n\n  \nThank you in advance to any/all of you for any guidance, I appreciate that I may be overlooking a blatantly obvious solution and can only apologise if this is the case, thanks again!\n\n  \n\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone.   \nMy nice's classmate  sent  her a very violent video via Instagram, telling her \"what they were going to do\" to one of her male friends. she says the video was basically  a death threat.   \nShe freaked out and deleted the whole chat, but now the school needs proof before they can  take action. We are going to the police, but they are likely to say the same. We are not in the USA.   \nI doubt this is a \"real\" threat, but better safe than sorry.  \nIs there a way to recover the video? we are doing a  data recovery via instagram, but I thought there might be other solutions?  \nThanks!",

My previous attempt caused a major system failure, and even after a clean Windows reinstall and enabling related BIOS/UEFI settings, HVCI still won't stay enabled after restarts. \n\n**Background**: I received a notice from Valorant stating that I must enable HVCI to continue playing. On Monday, I attempted to enable HVCI for the first time. This completely broke my PC (it became unusable), forcing me to perform a clean install of Windows on the affected drive.\n\n**Steps I've Taken Post-Reinstall**: \n\nReset my system and entered the BIOS/UEFI settings.\n\n Enabled the following features: \n\nUEFI mode Secure Boot \n\nTPM 2.0 \n\nIOMMU \n\n Attempted to enable HVCI again via Windows settings (Core Isolation > Memory Integrity).\n\n**Current Problem**: When I toggle HVCI on, Windows prompts me to restart the PC. During the restart: The first boot attempt hangs at the loading dots/circle (it stops spinning and freezes). The system automatically retries, and it successfully boots on the second attempt. However, once booted, HVCI is not actually enabled—it's reverted back to the \"off\" state, as if the change never took effect.",
