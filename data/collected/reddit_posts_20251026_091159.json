    "title": "I created yet another Pomodoro timer, but this one was inspired by Lo-Fi girl",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for improvement when designing for repairability, especially where Apple’s complex engineering is concerned. So the big question remaining from this year's big M5 announcement is: did Apple upgrade the MacBook Pro’s repairability?",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI’d like to share the app I’ve been working on over the past few months - **Dory**.\n\nI think the video does a much better job of explaining what it’s all about, so feel free to check it out here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z\\_Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z_Q)\n\n**Dory is an app switcher that lets you quickly cycle through apps without moving your hand from the mouse, keyboard or trackpad - and without needing to remember any shortcuts.**\n\nClick a mouse button - or a modifier key if both hands are on the keyboard - and type the first letter of the app’s name.\n\nFind apps using the first letter, middle letters, acronyms, or similar names.\n\nIf multiple apps share that letter, just keep tapping it to cycle through them.\n\nYou can also press the middle mouse button and start typing the app’s name directly.\n\nPrefer tapping over holding? No problem. With Press Mode, you can open Dory’s sleek UI using a global shortcut or a **trackpad gesture!** (new)\n\nDory works right out of the box - and over time, it learns which apps you use most and prioritizes them.\n\nNo extra shortcuts.\n\nNo setup. Nothing to remember.\n\n\\--\n\nIt's currently $4.99 on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dory-app-switcher/id6746273626?mt=12) (**One-time purchase**. **No subscription.**) for a limited time.",

I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

So the big question remaining from this year's big M5 announcement is: did Apple upgrade the MacBook Pro’s repairability?",

For the context, I am 180cm, 80 kilo, white-collar only person. \n3. I need to spend time on learning the OS. I was not expecting it. I take it as a feature, not a problem though. OS feels very polished compared to stock Android.\n4. Flares are a thing in night-shots. But I can live with it.\n5. Battery life is very good.\n6. The default font configuration in some apps (e.g. Facebook) are difficult to read for those wearing reading glasses. \n",

Probably stolen actually.\n\nThe battery was well charged, but I couldn't reach the phone by call (directly into voicemail) which is why I assumed it's turned off and stolen.\n\nI put it in Lost mode quite fast after I realized that it was lost (less than 1h). At this point, I already couldn't reach it by phone call.\n\nI used Find My on my computer but the phone appears Offline, and I cannot make it ring (it's still in \"Waiting\" mode for the ringing).\n\nI cannot recall if I activated the Location service or Find My (I assume I did for Find My since I can see it through iCloud).\n\nMy question is: Is there a way to know if Localisation is activated on the phone? Or as long as Find My is active, is it going to send the location automatically?\n\nOther question: since I just bought the phone, I think I have 3 free months of AppleCare coverage (I don't think I activated it) > is there a way to get back a new phone if I declare it stolen?\n\nThank you",

The case I’m using now is the Spigen Nano Pop MagFit. It has a great texture on the sides for grip, but that texture only goes half way up. I also like the texture they used on the buttons.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm hoping you can help me get out of a state of \"backup paralysis.\" My iPhone storage is constantly full, but I have a hard time deleting things, and I'm now stuck, not knowing what to do next.\n\nHere's my situation:\n\n* **On my iPhone:** It's full of photos, videos, and tons of screenshots. To be honest, I struggle to delete them. I'm either a chronic nostalgic attached to \"memories\" or a bit paranoid, thinking some screenshots could be useful as \"proof\" someday.\n* **On my Windows PC:** I have older photos and videos that I've already deleted from my iPhone to free up space in the past. These are now scattered in various folders on my desktop and an external hard drive, copied over time using Windows File Explorer or other random tools.\n\nMy goal is to finally tackle this. I want to move the current photos from my full iPhone over to my PC and consolidate everything into one single \"master folder.\" The main reason is to finally be able to see everything in one place and hunt down duplicates.\n\nBut I'm completely frozen because I don't know what tool to trust.\n\n* Should I use the standard backup process via iTunes (or its equivalent on Windows)?\n* Should I just drag and drop with File Explorer again?\n* Should I use a third-party software?\n\nMy biggest fear is this: If I use a \"smart\" software like iTunes, will it look at my PC, see photos that are no longer on my iPhone, and \"helpfully\" delete them to sync everything up? This would be my worst nightmare, as those files only exist on my PC now.\n\nSo, I'm looking for a safe, step-by-step workflow for someone who is overly attached to their files. What's the best way to:\n\n1. Safely transfer everything from my currently full iPhone to my PC?\n2. Merge these new files with all my old, scattered folders into one place?\n3. Effectively find and manage duplicates without wanting to pull my hair out?\n4. Establish a future-proof method for ongoing archiving that *never* automatically deletes old files?\n\nAny advice on a specific software or a reliable method would be incredibly appreciated. Thanks for helping me get organized!\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm a digital hoarder with a full iPhone and scattered old photos on my PC that I've already deleted from the phone. I'm paralyzed, looking for a safe workflow to transfer my current photos and consolidate everything on my PC without a new backup automatically deleting my old, PC-only files.",

    "selftext": "I honestly think the iPhone 17 Pro Max was a BS drop from Apple. They went from using titanium to aluminum, and to me, that screams cost-cutting more than “innovation.”\n\nApple knows titanium is expensive it’s hard to machine, costs more to source, and takes longer to produce at their scale. Switching back to aluminum looks like a move to save money and protect profit margins, not improve the product.\n\nI also think global tariffs and China’s control over raw materials play a big part here. When supply chains get tight or prices rise, Apple has two choices: eat the cost or adjust. And of course, they’re going to adjust. By going aluminum, they dodge some of that risk but at the cost of premium feel and material strength.\n\nIt’s smart from a business angle but kind of lazy from a product standpoint. Instead of pushing materials forward, Apple’s trying to reframe a downgrade as progress. You know they’ll market it as “aerospace-grade aluminum,” “lighter and more eco-friendly,” or something like that when in reality, it’s just a cheaper and safer play for their bottom line.\n\nThe sad part is, Apple has the talent, the R&D, and the resources to innovate in ways nobody else can but greed and investor pressure always win. They care more about quarterly numbers than long-term excitement right now.\n\nThis isn’t Apple “thinking differently.” This is Apple playing it safe to keep shareholders happy.",

[Back Market](https://www.backmarket.com/en-us), who I have used a few times and found to be great — no referral, just my real experience — offered $171 but I thought, well, these guys are all basically the same aren't they? Why wouldn't I take the $5. Apple did its usual thing: $170 before the new announcement, dropping to I think $130 after it. But, credit card points etc., so I'd prefer cash over a refund. Such small potatoes, for a not-so-small grift attempt.\n\nI had used Gazelle before and looking back, they did try some fun and games with an iPad mini though it did get sorted out, but paid in full on a 12\" MacBook. And back in the Stone Age I used to listen to Leo Laporte podcasts and they were a frequent sponsor, and Uncle Leo surely wouldn't work with skeevy merchants…!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whdl3djnibxf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=68adb60cf3ece52d24983fbe6d0093d862cfe987\n\nGazelle lost my iPhone for about a week. When it finally showed up they claimed some nonsense about condition, and downgraded my offer to **$65**, and you have a limited time before you are deemed to have accepted. I wondered if it might have been a typo: did they mean $165? No, they did not!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ukhx3ffibxf1.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4b7bf8f3f665a1e640b24c453a9534946f1b80b\n\nBut the thing is, I checked Gazelle's offer: and for lightly used (what I thought it was as the screen and camera glass were flawless) and scratched or scuffed (harsh but maybe fair) the offers were $164 and $156. That is, Gazelle itself would adjust the offer by $8 for cosmetic issues, so sure, maybe I was optimistic on the condition to get $176, but that would knock it to $168, no? Gazelle adjusted my offer by… **$111**, or **63%**. Clearly, they just hoped I would not want the hassle. Wrong, Gazelle. And you know, if you'd been less greedy, that would have been a fair bet. But reducing your offer by *two thirds*? Come on!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yv3vxz55ibxf1.png?width=2784&format=png&auto=webp&s=46e3e39a6087db30e815b686a182c508820d1127\n\nI asked for the return, and from other people's experiences I did wonder if they would \"lose\" it, but I got it back, and it was my actual phone. Conveniently, I also now had a nice box to ship it, too. So, I did get that.\n\nSo I have learned two things from this experience.\n\n1. You might be lucky and get an \"honest\" Gazelle offer, to make up the numbers. But they are trying to rip people off: there are too many complaints to chalk it up to random bad experiences. YMMV but I have liked Back Market and will use them in future. Not affiliated in any way, just trying to point anyone reading this and wondering what they are supposed to do in a helpful direction.\n2. I ended up using eBay. I had given up on eBay years ago when they were going through some phase of wanting to be Amazon and being horrible to individual sellers. It seems to have been a good experience: the buyer has received it, and says they're happy. Good grief but eBay takes a pound of flesh, but you can print the shipping label from within eBay and it's more of a hassle than a trade-in, but it's a lot easier than it used to be. I netted $196 after fees and shipping — and I did have the Gazelle box lol! — so I'm $20 up on where I thought I'd be. Meh, but I'll take it. Learning a lesson and writing this with the earnest hope it puts someone else off using Gazelle? Priceless.\n\nOh, and I got the iPhone Air. I'm a small phone guy (we lost the war, I know) and this thing is like a surfboard, but I do like it. I'm so old-skool I never really edited ion the phone anyway and use Photos on my Mac, so I am fine with the single camera, and so far battery life hasn't come close to being an issue: coming from a mini where I needed to nurse that like a drink after closing time. I agree with Gruber as well: there's something about the plateau that makes it rest nicely in the hand.",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

The case I’m using now is the Spigen Nano Pop MagFit. It has a great texture on the sides for grip, but that texture only goes half way up. I also like the texture they used on the buttons.

For the context, I am 180cm, 80 kilo, white-collar only person. \n3. I need to spend time on learning the OS. I was not expecting it. I take it as a feature, not a problem though. OS feels very polished compared to stock Android.\n4. Flares are a thing in night-shots. But I can live with it.\n5. Battery life is very good.\n6. The default font configuration in some apps (e.g. Facebook) are difficult to read for those wearing reading glasses. \n",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI bought the iPhone 17 2 weeks ago, and I lost it. Probably stolen actually.\n\nThe battery was well charged, but I couldn't reach the phone by call (directly into voicemail) which is why I assumed it's turned off and stolen.\n\nI put it in Lost mode quite fast after I realized that it was lost (less than 1h). At this point, I already couldn't reach it by phone call.\n\nI used Find My on my computer but the phone appears Offline, and I cannot make it ring (it's still in \"Waiting\" mode for the ringing).\n\nI cannot recall if I activated the Location service or Find My (I assume I did for Find My since I can see it through iCloud).\n\nMy question is: Is there a way to know if Localisation is activated on the phone? Or as long as Find My is active, is it going to send the location automatically?\n\nOther question: since I just bought the phone, I think I have 3 free months of AppleCare coverage (I don't think I activated it) > is there a way to get back a new phone if I declare it stolen?\n\nThank you",

The case I’m using now is the Spigen Nano Pop MagFit. It has a great texture on the sides for grip, but that texture only goes half way up. I also like the texture they used on the buttons. I just wish they had different color options. I have a Ringke Onyx case coming tomorrow that looks a lot like the Caudabe case, so I’ll see how that one is. ",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre’s report clearly mentioned “Display – step mark on display.”\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called “flagship quality” completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care — never dropped, always in Samsung’s original case and protector — yet the display failed twice. It’s shocking how a premium device costing nearly ₹1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite — big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you’re left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand’s promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course). I would LOVE if google would implement Android XR in Android. I dont mind my phone getting hot but I wouldn't have to sync my photos and all of that.",

You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "selftext": "Recently, I was searching for flip phone reviews and saw an article on the Vertu website. The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre’s report clearly mentioned “Display – step mark on display.”\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called “flagship quality” completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care — never dropped, always in Samsung’s original case and protector — yet the display failed twice. It’s shocking how a premium device costing nearly ₹1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite — big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you’re left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand’s promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI’m an indie Android developer, and over the past few months I’ve been working on something that brings back the old-school radio experience — but built for the modern Android ecosystem.\n\nThe app lets users:  \n📻 Listen to **50,000+ live radio stations** from around the world (music, news, talk, podcasts).  \n🌎 **Browse by Country, Genre, or Language** — for example, K-Pop from Korea or classic rock from the US.  \n🔎 **Global Search** — find any station by keyword, location, or genre.  \n❤️ **Favorite stations** to build your personal list.  \n😴 **Sleep Timer & Auto Start** — one of my favorite features for night listening.\n\nMy focus was on keeping it lightweight, responsive, and aligned with Android design principles — no clutter, just pure listening.\n\nI’d love to hear from **Android enthusiasts** about what makes a radio or music app *feel native* and enjoyable on Android.\n\n* Do you prefer Material-You dynamic theming?\n* Would background playback controls via notification or lock screen make a difference?\n* Any UI or UX preferences that make you stay longer in such apps?\n\n👉 For those curious, it’s available on the Play Store here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newradio.fmradio.radio.radiotuner.radiostation.freeradio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newradio.fmradio.radio.radiotuner.radiostation.freeradio)\n\nHappy to take feedback, discuss architecture, and chat about how I implemented global streaming efficiently for Android.\n\nThanks for reading — your suggestions can genuinely help me polish this for future updates 🙏",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

    "selftext": "So like many people, I need to wake up earlier mon-fri for work, and like to sleep in on the weekends. My alarm on the default clock app is set for weekdays only. I used to have bedtime mode set up that it would then on when I plugged my phone in at night (which is when I was going to sleep) and then it would start in bedtime mode until a) my alarm went off or b) I unplugged my phone. This meant on weekends my phone would stay silent until I woke up and unplugged it myself.\nSince I updated my phone this week, bedtime mode will now turn itself off after the alarm time as that is when it says my \"night time\" ends, even if my phone is still plugged in and has not been touched. This means as soon as I get a notification on a weekend morning, I wake up and my precious lie in is ruined.\nAny one else having the same issue and any idea how to fix this? Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Google has been giving me the runaround from a promotion they promised to apply to my order for two months now, and just taking it to the Internet to vent, and shed some negative light on their customer service.\n\nBelow is a recent note I sent after my now (unsuccessful) battle with getting Google Customer Service to honor a discount code:\n\nHere's what has happened so far:\n\nOn August 20, 2025 I placed order GS.xxxxxxxxx (x'd out for privacy) for a Pixel 10 Pro and a Nest Thermostat. The Nest Thermostat had a discount applied since my existing Nest went obsolete\n\nOn August 21, 2025 I received a discount code for \"10% off a purchase.\" Rather than cancel my order which hadn't yet shipped, and replace the order with the discount code, I reached out to customer service to see if they could retroactively apply.\n\nCustomer service told me the following:\n\n11:49:06 AM (me): Ok, so to be clear - once the entire order arrives (the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro), you want me to reach back out to the Google Support chat and share the coupon code, and then you'll apply the code to the order price after it's been delivered?\n11:50:15 AM Robertson: Yes, exactly. that is correct. we are also informed by our support on that (my name), rather than cancelling the order and apply the code, its much more a hassle in our customers end as per our support team\n11:50:42 AM Robertson: no worries once you contacted us back we can consult the case so the code will be applied\n11:52:02 AM (me): Yeah it seems like a pain to cancel / re-order. And can you confirm that the 10% will be applied to both the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro? I did have some rebates / offers on these items that were applied (such as being a Google Fi customer), but wanted to make sure the 10% is still applicable on top of those discounts\n11:54:35 AM Robertson: Oh yes, the 10% discount it will be applicable on top of those discounts (my name) no worries \n\n\nBecause of this, I didn't cancel and replace the order. \n\nHad I done so, I at least would have separated the order into two orders - and gotten the discount on the Nest for one order, and the discount on my phone (an extra $100 off) on the other.\n\nNow after TWO MONTHS of back and forth with customer service, I keep getting told that Google won't apply the discount like the original customer service agent guaranteed me they would. Google has effectively cheated me out of over $100.\n\nAll of their responses ignore the original interaction I had, including the most recent one:\n\nThank you for contacting the Google Support Team regarding your order. We sincerely apologize for the delay in our response and truly appreciate your patience during this review period.\n\nOur specialist team has thoroughly reviewed your request to apply an additional promotional code to your order. We regret to inform you that we cannot accommodate this request.\n\nWe understand this outcome is disappointing, and we want to sincerely apologize for any confusion or frustration this may have caused.\n\nOur higher support team confirmed that a prior promotion—the Nest Learning Thermostat upgrade promotion—was already utilized on the existing order where you wished to apply the new code. As per our terms of service, only one promotional code or discount can be applied per order. This policy prevents us from stacking multiple discounts onto a single purchase.\n\nWe recognize the frustration of not being able to use the additional discount, and we truly apologize for this policy constraint.\n\nIf you have any further questions, or if you need assistance exploring other ways to save on a future purchase, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nThanks!\nCed\nThe Google Support Team\n\n\nThere have been over 20 interactions back and forth, all of them ignore what the first agent told me. Anyone else go through this before?",

    "selftext": "Well, I have been searching for this specific issue all over the internet to see if this is a common issue or not, but I couldn't find anything anywhere, so I guess I was the only lucky guy to experience this.\nA week ago, I was at a Barber 💈 shop with my friend, and I really like to take photos anywhere I go, so we did take some really good pictures for each other using my Pixel 10. I then realized that all the photos I take are in the processing state for too long(never end for first photo), but I didn't think too much, and we keep on taking photos regardless of the last photos being in the processing state. Long story short, after our excellent barber done his job, I took some mirror selfie and would like to post it on my Facebook, but the photos are (still) processing. I then looked at the file names by chance and saw \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxxxx.jpg\" for these photos, oh yeah, may be my photos are so good that tensor G5 needs more time, I wonder. \nBut I really want to upload that mirror selfie on my Facebook, I couldn't wait more. So I did the most dumbest decision, I restarted my phone, just that the processing would start again and fix. But guess what and to my surprise, after restarting the phone, all of these previous \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxx.jpg\" were gone in thin air, I couldn't find it on photos, cloud, not on the trash. I really didn't believe that Google might have that kind of problem, so I waited, I tried taking another photos and these seem to become normal with their processing time being normal (1-3 sec) back again. But yet, the photos at the barber shop never came back. This is just my experience sharing about that and still no hate for Pixel (had been a fan since Nexus), but I think they might include some mitigation for this kind of situation, for example, at least saving the Non- processed photos on device or some kind of fail safe feature. \nBut yeah, this was the only time I've experienced this, and so far it's still working as expected. I hope this doesn't come again. Evidence? No, I really didn't think that kind of thing would ever happen, so no screenshot nor nothing was recorded.\n",

Also, I don't have a 'google authorized' service center in my country. Honestly, this sure looks to me like they got a little too impatient to wait for the planned obsolescense to kick in, and the battery issue was just too easy of an opportunity to force a purchase from a ton of customers, so I'm out. Bye bye, damn shame as I liked your phones, but you are an awful, soulless company anyways, so I'm moving on.\n\nThat said, I'm not one who particularly trusts tech, but I (like all of use) haven't had much choice in going along with the integration of it in our lives, and given the amount of information our devices now carry and as they literally serve as primary sources of identity confirmation, I'm not happy to be pushed to have to switch devices sooner than I'd like. Transferring from the 5 to the 6 was fine; as I recall, a pretty seamless transfer. Going from a Pixel to a different manufacturer? I've not had any experience with that, so I'm hoping to avoid any sort of deluge of idiotic, innane problems like the ones I've seen reported in this sub (locked out of google account etc.).\n\nWhat would be the best manufacturer to graduate to with minimal conflict? I'm not tech-incapable, I simply do not trust the level of intrustion/dependence on it in our lives, and thus things like this make me nervous af. I'd prefer as seamless experience as possible, so any advice or suggestions are much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

I got used to the issues in thermals, battery, and bad modems. I accepted it's flaws and moved on, the camera was great so no biggie right.\n\nThen the Pixel 10 impressions started coming in and it was honestly disheartening, I been looking forward to that phone since the early leaks. Overall not a big upgrade, all the same issues, and the GPU performance and drivers situation. Performance just trailing too behind other phones at it's price range. I know I know \"benchmarks aren't everything, optimization is king, you only need that power for gaming and blah blah\". Yeah until your phone has to brute force an unoptimized app (which is common on Android I fear) all Pixel owners I dare you open Best Buy or Amazon and immediately try to scroll, it WILL struggle. \n\nI decided to jump ship and got a One Plus 13, and let me tell you it was night and day. I got the 16 + 512 GB one for 800 (It was a sale + student discount). The performance jump was astronomical, this thing just flies through apps like it's nothing. Gaming of course is also no problem. The battery lasted 8+ hours on 5G (a miracle on pixel if you even get there). Thermal performance is excellent, no more hand warmer when just watching YouTube on wifi or just barely pushing it (Seriously how was that a thing). It truly felt like I had a flaship for real this time. \n\nIs it perfect? nah, Pixel UI is in general better, but not by much, if anything Oxygen OS let's you do things that were taken away, like status bar icons being able to be modified. Tho Pixel UI has one BIG FLAW, the status bar and gesture bar are disgustingly large and DON'T go transparent at all (Shit takes way too much screen real state like wtf). Oxygen OS lets you get rid of the gesture bar completely and it makes the phone feels much more immersive and its a godsend (been wanting this on pixel since the gesture bar was introduced). The camera is worse yes, but not too far behind either, I don't think too many pics so I was ok with this compromise. I don't care, and barely used, any of the AI features so it wasn't a big loss either.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the happiest I've been with a phone ever, don't be afraid to look outside of your pixel bubble if you feel like you're not getting what you paid for.

The most the Google support agent was able to do was tell me they \"submitted a request to the development team for a fix to roll out in a future update\" and give me a code for a 20% discount off of a new, previous-gen pixel 8 or 9 (lol).  \n\nI absolutely love the Pixel brand and have been purchasing Pixel and Google hardware since the Pixel 3, including Buds, Watches, Speakers, smart devices, and more.  \n\nI wanted to know if others have experienced this, or if someone could help me. \n\n",

He says the repair would be like $500, so I should just get a new phone. They open a support ticket for me.\n\nFirst support tells me I'm out of luck because it's out of warranty, even given the upgrade killing the phone. Then I ask to escalate, and they ask for temporary access to my Google account and a proof of purchase. I consent and send them proof of purchase from Google Fi. Then they ask me for a diagnostic receipt from the Google Store visit, but I never got anything like that.\n\nSo I just give up and buy a Pixel 10 Pro because 2 weeks without of phone is getting in the way of work now, as peaceful as it was.\n\nSo yeah, careful out there, make sure you have backups and 2FA synced to the cloud or other devices before doing major upgrades.\n\nI've had the Pixel phones since the Nexus phones, so it's really disheartening that a major upgrade would do this and I would get 0 help and only runarounds from Google.",

    "selftext": "I had every single version of the pixel up until the pixel 6 pro, which I had lots of problems with regarding Bluetooth hearing aid functionality and support. Since I wearing aids it was pretty important that that worked for me, and it didn't.  I then moved to Samsung and have been with them ever since. \n\nRecently AT&T offered a \"get a pixel 10 pro XL for free with a trade-in of any pixel\" and I still had my pixel 6 pro so I decided to give it another try. Here's why I ended up sending it back...\n\n1.  I don't know if this is a move your data from Samsung to pixel problem but when I moved my data over to the pixel 10 pro none of my apps would send notifications. Google support was unhelpful and after a factory reset didn't resolve it they basically told me to turn it in for another phone, which I did. I got the second phone and has the same problem. I ended up figuring out that if I went into each app and deleted the cache and the data then the notifications would start working again. Since I have 250 plus apps that wasn't a very good solution. \n\n2.  I had heard that the pixel phones had a really bad scrolling experience, but I don't remember it when I had pixel phones. Coming from the Samsung it was blatantly obvious that scrolling on the pixel was awful. I did check some of the solutions to resolve this and none of them really made it much better.\n\n3.  The final straw was Bluetooth switching.  My Samsung phones prioritize the newest connection, which is super important to me. I go from my hearing aids to the car when I get into it, and when I leave the car it goes back to my hearing aids. When I  turn on my Bluetooth headphones the phone picks them and when I turn them off it goes back to my hearing aids. With the pixel none of that happened. When I got in the car I had had to actually select the car Bluetooth for the pixel to use it. When I turned on my Bluetooth headphones I had to actually select them for the pixel to use them. Needless to say that was a major irritation and that's when I decided the pixel was going back.",

My phone’s battery expanded, pushing up the screen — a clear hardware defect that many Pixel 7 users have reported.\n\nAfter multiple emails and days of waiting, Google Support said they would refund the amount only the battery replacement if done through their authorized service partner CTDI (Aperia Mall, Singapore), but not other parts.\n\nFinally, I had no choice but to accept the change of battery only, since my screen was still working. I brought my device to Google’s authorized service partner, CTDI. However, to my horror they refused to replace just the battery and insisted that it is a policy I must also replace the screen, the LCD cost about SGD 200++— even though the swelling itself caused the damage.\n\nThis feels like an outright scam or cost-shifting tactic — forcing customers to pay for screen replacement that resulted from a known manufacturing defect. Google should take full responsibility instead of making users pay for damage caused by their own hardware fault.\n\nI’m without a working device for 5days+, and Google took their time to get back to me despite countless chasers, the lack of urgency is very disappointing.\n\nAt the end of the day,\n\nI made wasted trips down to service center (wasted time and transport fare) Unnecessary aggravation - service center insist I needed to change both screen + battery. Still without a functioning phone after 6 days+ Service Partner, CTDI, did sense my frustration and took my phone in to escalate to Google, However this would be at least a 3 business days process (with no guarantee) + 2 days of weekend.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue recently?\n\nDid Google cover both the battery and screen replacement for you?\n\nIf you’re facing the same problem, please make your voice heard. The more of us report it, the harder it’ll be for Google to ignore this widespread defect",

Because my phone received the OTA update, they believe it’s safe to use.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear: my Pixel 6a’s battery is swollen.\nThe back panel is literally lifting, and the phone looks like it could burst at any moment.\nYet Google Support — a trillion-dollar company — tells me it’s “safe” simply because of a software patch.\n\nThis isn’t just negligence. It feels like a deliberate attempt to gaslight affected customers.\n\nEven worse, Google’s own appeasement program page says the appeasement app disables affected phones after identifying the fault — since they’re unsafe to use.\nBut the support agent told me the exact opposite: that my phone is not affected because it got the OTA that supposedly “makes it safe.”\n\nSo which is it? Because right now, it feels like a scam tactic to deny legitimate claims while pretending the problem doesn’t exist.\n\nMy battery life has been destroyed since that update — it barely lasts an hour now, runs hot, and is clearly unstable.\nIf this is what Google calls safe, they’ve lost touch with reality and consumer safety.\n\nThis isn’t just a complaint — it’s a warning to other Pixel users.\nDon’t let them silence you with scripted replies and fake “OTA fixes.”\nMy case proves they are ignoring real safety hazards and denying rightful appeasements with deceptive reasoning.\n\nGoogle, you’ve had 100+ days to do the right thing.\nInstead, you chose to insult your customers’ intelligence and risk their safety.",

Currently, Android users are locked into Google One, Apple users into iCloud, and Windows users into OneDrive.",

I've been searching for an answer for a few hours and I keep landing on \"change the settings for the main camera app, if this doesn't work, uninstall and reinstall Camera App updates\". This has not worked and I can't figure out why it works in the camera app but not Google lens.    \nFor clarity, I am pressing the camera icon in the Google search bar at the bottom of the home screen as I use this multiple times a day. It's a minor gripe but I'm often using my phone one-handed and having to juggle my grip to press the shutter button on-screen is a kerfuffle.    \n    \nAm I being an idiot and missing a simple solution or do I need to download something third-party to circumvent this?    \n    \nI appreciate any feedback and I've now joined this sub because I've already found some useful tips I didn't know I needed!

    "title": "My < 14 months old Pixel 9 Pro XL is a brick!!",
    "selftext": "Up until this Wednesday evening, I was almost happy with my phone - some hiccups though over the span of 12 months - blank screen, sudden hang ups, brightness issues, overheating when using video etc. Despite all these bugs, this was the best android phone I had ever used - sleek, stylish, smooth and snappy.....buggy though..... - but tough love!! <3 \n\nJust after making a call, I pressed the power button. Little did I know this would be the last time I would have used the device. It died! No matter how many CPRs ([Google Pixel 9 Pro (XL) Black Screen Of Death? (SOLVED)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRwlpGb1gqk)) I would try!!! Then came the awakening. I visited the so called Google Exclusive Service Center in Bengaluru where I had to pay 850INR for inspection and on request they said the diagnosis would be done on priority. After 30 minutes, I went back and I was told the bad news which I expected anyways - \"The motherboard has died. You would need to pay 43000 INR for its replacement. Since it is already almost 2 months the warranty expired, this is not covered\" - The tone was not even consoling...haha....it was pitiful....I am a fairly average user with most of my usage being entertainment and browsing....this came as a shock to me!!\n\nI feel appalled because unlike our US counterparts, Indians have to shell out a major portion of their monthly salary to buy these flagship phones. Imagine earning 2Lacs a month and paying 1.25 Lacs for the device which promised 7 years of OS updates when ironically it is not even able to guarantee 14 months of lifespan.....IMHO this is pure deception and scam being inflicted on the people. I know this is not unlike other companies but hey at least OnePlus has owned its defects and came back with friendlier policies and even expanded it to India. It has ensured to expand its official service centres with very good staff across every major cities in the country unlike Google which has not bothered yet to work on after sales.\n\nThis was a lesson for me on a variety of topics in this life - from consumerism to capitalism, from self reflection to self destruction - we should not fall to marketing gimmicks and shenanigans these BigTech employ to make you feel like you are missing something if you dont have their products. I have learned a valuable lesson that **Don't buy a product which has close to negligible after sales service and negligible empathy for customers**. While Google does have a great software team, its hardware offerings are meh! I feel I cheated on my OP7T which still work like butter even now! Sorry OP!!!!!! \\_/\\\\\\_   \nI held back on buying a flagship phone for almost 10 years and now I think I should never have. :(\n\nI should have never expected in the first place that a company with such a poor and pathetic track record with hardware can create magical experience with mobile phones. After all phones are not just their looks. What matters the most is whether they can walk significantly with you in your life and whether the manufacturer actually has this intention. I am pretty sure Google doesn't especially not in countries like India.",

The removal of the rear finger print sensor kept me from the 4 & the design of the rear camera bezel kept me from 6-8. Plus I think many of us agree that 5 was peak. I didn't know that until I made the change.\n\nI had hoped that the 9 would grow on me, but I continue to hate its bulkiness.

    "selftext": "Google has been giving me the runaround from a promotion they promised to apply to my order for two months now, and just taking it to the Internet to vent, and shed some negative light on their customer service.\n\nBelow is a recent note I sent after my now (unsuccessful) battle with getting Google Customer Service to honor a discount code:\n\nHere's what has happened so far:\n\nOn August 20, 2025 I placed order GS.xxxxxxxxx (x'd out for privacy) for a Pixel 10 Pro and a Nest Thermostat. The Nest Thermostat had a discount applied since my existing Nest went obsolete\n\nOn August 21, 2025 I received a discount code for \"10% off a purchase.\" Rather than cancel my order which hadn't yet shipped, and replace the order with the discount code, I reached out to customer service to see if they could retroactively apply.\n\nCustomer service told me the following:\n\n11:49:06 AM (me): Ok, so to be clear - once the entire order arrives (the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro), you want me to reach back out to the Google Support chat and share the coupon code, and then you'll apply the code to the order price after it's been delivered?\n11:50:15 AM Robertson: Yes, exactly. that is correct. we are also informed by our support on that (my name), rather than cancelling the order and apply the code, its much more a hassle in our customers end as per our support team\n11:50:42 AM Robertson: no worries once you contacted us back we can consult the case so the code will be applied\n11:52:02 AM (me): Yeah it seems like a pain to cancel / re-order. And can you confirm that the 10% will be applied to both the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro? I did have some rebates / offers on these items that were applied (such as being a Google Fi customer), but wanted to make sure the 10% is still applicable on top of those discounts\n11:54:35 AM Robertson: Oh yes, the 10% discount it will be applicable on top of those discounts (my name) no worries \n\n\nBecause of this, I didn't cancel and replace the order. \n\nHad I done so, I at least would have separated the order into two orders - and gotten the discount on the Nest for one order, and the discount on my phone (an extra $100 off) on the other.\n\nNow after TWO MONTHS of back and forth with customer service, I keep getting told that Google won't apply the discount like the original customer service agent guaranteed me they would. Google has effectively cheated me out of over $100.\n\nAll of their responses ignore the original interaction I had, including the most recent one:\n\nThank you for contacting the Google Support Team regarding your order. We sincerely apologize for the delay in our response and truly appreciate your patience during this review period.\n\nOur specialist team has thoroughly reviewed your request to apply an additional promotional code to your order. We regret to inform you that we cannot accommodate this request.\n\nWe understand this outcome is disappointing, and we want to sincerely apologize for any confusion or frustration this may have caused.\n\nOur higher support team confirmed that a prior promotion—the Nest Learning Thermostat upgrade promotion—was already utilized on the existing order where you wished to apply the new code. As per our terms of service, only one promotional code or discount can be applied per order. This policy prevents us from stacking multiple discounts onto a single purchase.\n\nWe recognize the frustration of not being able to use the additional discount, and we truly apologize for this policy constraint.\n\nIf you have any further questions, or if you need assistance exploring other ways to save on a future purchase, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nThanks!\nCed\nThe Google Support Team\n\n\nThere have been over 20 interactions back and forth, all of them ignore what the first agent told me. Anyone else go through this before?",

    "selftext": "So like many people, I need to wake up earlier mon-fri for work, and like to sleep in on the weekends. My alarm on the default clock app is set for weekdays only. I used to have bedtime mode set up that it would then on when I plugged my phone in at night (which is when I was going to sleep) and then it would start in bedtime mode until a) my alarm went off or b) I unplugged my phone. This meant on weekends my phone would stay silent until I woke up and unplugged it myself.\nSince I updated my phone this week, bedtime mode will now turn itself off after the alarm time as that is when it says my \"night time\" ends, even if my phone is still plugged in and has not been touched. This means as soon as I get a notification on a weekend morning, I wake up and my precious lie in is ruined.\nAny one else having the same issue and any idea how to fix this? Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Well, I have been searching for this specific issue all over the internet to see if this is a common issue or not, but I couldn't find anything anywhere, so I guess I was the only lucky guy to experience this.\nA week ago, I was at a Barber 💈 shop with my friend, and I really like to take photos anywhere I go, so we did take some really good pictures for each other using my Pixel 10. I then realized that all the photos I take are in the processing state for too long(never end for first photo), but I didn't think too much, and we keep on taking photos regardless of the last photos being in the processing state. Long story short, after our excellent barber done his job, I took some mirror selfie and would like to post it on my Facebook, but the photos are (still) processing. I then looked at the file names by chance and saw \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxxxx.jpg\" for these photos, oh yeah, may be my photos are so good that tensor G5 needs more time, I wonder. \nBut I really want to upload that mirror selfie on my Facebook, I couldn't wait more. So I did the most dumbest decision, I restarted my phone, just that the processing would start again and fix. But guess what and to my surprise, after restarting the phone, all of these previous \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxx.jpg\" were gone in thin air, I couldn't find it on photos, cloud, not on the trash. I really didn't believe that Google might have that kind of problem, so I waited, I tried taking another photos and these seem to become normal with their processing time being normal (1-3 sec) back again. But yet, the photos at the barber shop never came back. This is just my experience sharing about that and still no hate for Pixel (had been a fan since Nexus), but I think they might include some mitigation for this kind of situation, for example, at least saving the Non- processed photos on device or some kind of fail safe feature. \nBut yeah, this was the only time I've experienced this, and so far it's still working as expected. I hope this doesn't come again. Evidence? No, I really didn't think that kind of thing would ever happen, so no screenshot nor nothing was recorded.\n",

The only problem is, rooting the device so that it can have this badic feature (that should already be an option available to everyone, not just certain regions, IMO) requires a root. \n\nBut rooting breaks banking apps, AI, and weirdly. Screenshots 😂 to name but a few. \n\n\nI literally only want to be able to record phone calls, anyone know how I can do this without rooting? No apps in the app store work because there are restrictions in the newer versions of Android, and this has been the case for some time now. Yes you can get apps, but they don't work well, sometimes not at all. \n\nIs there any way to get call recording WITHOUT rooting? Or is there some method that's maybe a little less full on than rooting that keeps everything else working? \n\nMany thanks in advance 🙏 ",

However Google support are stuck in a process loop where they insist that I provide a PDF copy of a repair order, which the company who did the repair cannot provide, as their system does not output PDFs. Additionally I'm being asked to go back to the company repeatedly for this info.\n\nCan anyone help me get this escalated to someone at Google with autonomy to get this resolved? Or does anyone have a contact or someone at Google who monitors reddit who could help?\n\nIn case anyone assumes I'm trying to pull a con on Google - I'd gain nothing here if they RMA as I would like.

    "selftext": "\\*\\* Yeah, I know it's a pretty dumb little opinion question, but I still place more value in human responses from internet strangers than I do from trying to glean anything at all from targeted articles, sponsored videos etc.\n\nI've got the 6a, and I planned on replacing the battery and just keeping it as long as possible, but I'm seeing plenty of reports here that even that doesn't mitigated the update, and even a brand new battery is going to have quite bad performance. Also, I don't have a 'google authorized' service center in my country. Honestly, this sure looks to me like they got a little too impatient to wait for the planned obsolescense to kick in, and the battery issue was just too easy of an opportunity to force a purchase from a ton of customers, so I'm out. Bye bye, damn shame as I liked your phones, but you are an awful, soulless company anyways, so I'm moving on.\n\nThat said, I'm not one who particularly trusts tech, but I (like all of use) haven't had much choice in going along with the integration of it in our lives, and given the amount of information our devices now carry and as they literally serve as primary sources of identity confirmation, I'm not happy to be pushed to have to switch devices sooner than I'd like. Transferring from the 5 to the 6 was fine; as I recall, a pretty seamless transfer. Going from a Pixel to a different manufacturer? I've not had any experience with that, so I'm hoping to avoid any sort of deluge of idiotic, innane problems like the ones I've seen reported in this sub (locked out of google account etc.).\n\nWhat would be the best manufacturer to graduate to with minimal conflict? I'm not tech-incapable, I simply do not trust the level of intrustion/dependence on it in our lives, and thus things like this make me nervous af. I'd prefer as seamless experience as possible, so any advice or suggestions are much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Google Case no.: 4-1941000040097 & 4-4312000039720\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m extremely disappointed with how Google Support has handled my Pixel 7 battery swelling issue. My phone’s battery expanded, pushing up the screen — a clear hardware defect that many Pixel 7 users have reported.\n\nAfter multiple emails and days of waiting, Google Support said they would refund the amount only the battery replacement if done through their authorized service partner CTDI (Aperia Mall, Singapore), but not other parts.\n\nFinally, I had no choice but to accept the change of battery only, since my screen was still working. I brought my device to Google’s authorized service partner, CTDI. However, to my horror they refused to replace just the battery and insisted that it is a policy I must also replace the screen, the LCD cost about SGD 200++— even though the swelling itself caused the damage.\n\nThis feels like an outright scam or cost-shifting tactic — forcing customers to pay for screen replacement that resulted from a known manufacturing defect. Google should take full responsibility instead of making users pay for damage caused by their own hardware fault.\n\nI’m without a working device for 5days+, and Google took their time to get back to me despite countless chasers, the lack of urgency is very disappointing.\n\nAt the end of the day,\n\nI made wasted trips down to service center (wasted time and transport fare) Unnecessary aggravation - service center insist I needed to change both screen + battery. Still without a functioning phone after 6 days+ Service Partner, CTDI, did sense my frustration and took my phone in to escalate to Google, However this would be at least a 3 business days process (with no guarantee) + 2 days of weekend.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue recently?\n\nDid Google cover both the battery and screen replacement for you?\n\nIf you’re facing the same problem, please make your voice heard. The more of us report it, the harder it’ll be for Google to ignore this widespread defect",

    "selftext": "Google has been giving me the runaround from a promotion they promised to apply to my order for two months now, and just taking it to the Internet to vent, and shed some negative light on their customer service.\n\nBelow is a recent note I sent after my now (unsuccessful) battle with getting Google Customer Service to honor a discount code:\n\nHere's what has happened so far:\n\nOn August 20, 2025 I placed order GS.xxxxxxxxx (x'd out for privacy) for a Pixel 10 Pro and a Nest Thermostat. The Nest Thermostat had a discount applied since my existing Nest went obsolete\n\nOn August 21, 2025 I received a discount code for \"10% off a purchase.\" Rather than cancel my order which hadn't yet shipped, and replace the order with the discount code, I reached out to customer service to see if they could retroactively apply.\n\nCustomer service told me the following:\n\n11:49:06 AM (me): Ok, so to be clear - once the entire order arrives (the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro), you want me to reach back out to the Google Support chat and share the coupon code, and then you'll apply the code to the order price after it's been delivered?\n11:50:15 AM Robertson: Yes, exactly. that is correct. we are also informed by our support on that (my name), rather than cancelling the order and apply the code, its much more a hassle in our customers end as per our support team\n11:50:42 AM Robertson: no worries once you contacted us back we can consult the case so the code will be applied\n11:52:02 AM (me): Yeah it seems like a pain to cancel / re-order. And can you confirm that the 10% will be applied to both the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro? I did have some rebates / offers on these items that were applied (such as being a Google Fi customer), but wanted to make sure the 10% is still applicable on top of those discounts\n11:54:35 AM Robertson: Oh yes, the 10% discount it will be applicable on top of those discounts (my name) no worries \n\n\nBecause of this, I didn't cancel and replace the order. \n\nHad I done so, I at least would have separated the order into two orders - and gotten the discount on the Nest for one order, and the discount on my phone (an extra $100 off) on the other.\n\nNow after TWO MONTHS of back and forth with customer service, I keep getting told that Google won't apply the discount like the original customer service agent guaranteed me they would. Google has effectively cheated me out of over $100.\n\nAll of their responses ignore the original interaction I had, including the most recent one:\n\nThank you for contacting the Google Support Team regarding your order. We sincerely apologize for the delay in our response and truly appreciate your patience during this review period.\n\nOur specialist team has thoroughly reviewed your request to apply an additional promotional code to your order. We regret to inform you that we cannot accommodate this request.\n\nWe understand this outcome is disappointing, and we want to sincerely apologize for any confusion or frustration this may have caused.\n\nOur higher support team confirmed that a prior promotion—the Nest Learning Thermostat upgrade promotion—was already utilized on the existing order where you wished to apply the new code. As per our terms of service, only one promotional code or discount can be applied per order. This policy prevents us from stacking multiple discounts onto a single purchase.\n\nWe recognize the frustration of not being able to use the additional discount, and we truly apologize for this policy constraint.\n\nIf you have any further questions, or if you need assistance exploring other ways to save on a future purchase, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nThanks!\nCed\nThe Google Support Team\n\n\nThere have been over 20 interactions back and forth, all of them ignore what the first agent told me. Anyone else go through this before?",

    "selftext": "So like many people, I need to wake up earlier mon-fri for work, and like to sleep in on the weekends. My alarm on the default clock app is set for weekdays only. I used to have bedtime mode set up that it would then on when I plugged my phone in at night (which is when I was going to sleep) and then it would start in bedtime mode until a) my alarm went off or b) I unplugged my phone. This meant on weekends my phone would stay silent until I woke up and unplugged it myself.\nSince I updated my phone this week, bedtime mode will now turn itself off after the alarm time as that is when it says my \"night time\" ends, even if my phone is still plugged in and has not been touched. This means as soon as I get a notification on a weekend morning, I wake up and my precious lie in is ruined.\nAny one else having the same issue and any idea how to fix this? Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Well, I have been searching for this specific issue all over the internet to see if this is a common issue or not, but I couldn't find anything anywhere, so I guess I was the only lucky guy to experience this.\nA week ago, I was at a Barber 💈 shop with my friend, and I really like to take photos anywhere I go, so we did take some really good pictures for each other using my Pixel 10. I then realized that all the photos I take are in the processing state for too long(never end for first photo), but I didn't think too much, and we keep on taking photos regardless of the last photos being in the processing state. Long story short, after our excellent barber done his job, I took some mirror selfie and would like to post it on my Facebook, but the photos are (still) processing. I then looked at the file names by chance and saw \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxxxx.jpg\" for these photos, oh yeah, may be my photos are so good that tensor G5 needs more time, I wonder. \nBut I really want to upload that mirror selfie on my Facebook, I couldn't wait more. So I did the most dumbest decision, I restarted my phone, just that the processing would start again and fix. But guess what and to my surprise, after restarting the phone, all of these previous \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxx.jpg\" were gone in thin air, I couldn't find it on photos, cloud, not on the trash. I really didn't believe that Google might have that kind of problem, so I waited, I tried taking another photos and these seem to become normal with their processing time being normal (1-3 sec) back again. But yet, the photos at the barber shop never came back. This is just my experience sharing about that and still no hate for Pixel (had been a fan since Nexus), but I think they might include some mitigation for this kind of situation, for example, at least saving the Non- processed photos on device or some kind of fail safe feature. \nBut yeah, this was the only time I've experienced this, and so far it's still working as expected. I hope this doesn't come again. Evidence? No, I really didn't think that kind of thing would ever happen, so no screenshot nor nothing was recorded.\n",

No apps in the app store work because there are restrictions in the newer versions of Android, and this has been the case for some time now. Yes you can get apps, but they don't work well, sometimes not at all. \n\nIs there any way to get call recording WITHOUT rooting?

    "selftext": "Pixel 9 Pro\n\nBackground - I've had my pixel 9 Pro screen replaced twice under warranty and within two days of the last replacement the panel cracked(?) from behind with a growing area of dead pixels and a few horizontal lines of stuck pixels. I'm in the UK and the same day warranty repair places are few and far between if you're not in a major city - I can't send my phone away from a few days as I use it to pay for things etc and I don't have a spare device. \n\nI've asked Google to RMA (device is within warranty) as I think the screen failing twice with no external impacts or damage suggests an issue with the device somewhere else. However Google support are stuck in a process loop where they insist that I provide a PDF copy of a repair order, which the company who did the repair cannot provide, as their system does not output PDFs. Additionally I'm being asked to go back to the company repeatedly for this info.\n\nCan anyone help me get this escalated to someone at Google with autonomy to get this resolved? Or does anyone have a contact or someone at Google who monitors reddit who could help?\n\nIn case anyone assumes I'm trying to pull a con on Google - I'd gain nothing here if they RMA as I would like. My device is fairly pristine so Google get that back to repair and then have a refurbed phone, I get a refurbished phone. No gain financially.",

The phone would still work, but the screen only was a blank, white screen. This was done under warranty repair at UBreakIFix. \n\nNow less than 6 months later, the replaced screen is still having issues that are not user-error. \n\nMy standard 1-year warranty expired last month. Because of this, UBreakIFix stated they will not honor a warranty on their 6-month-old replacement part. The most the Google support agent was able to do was tell me they \"submitted a request to the development team for a fix to roll out in a future update\" and give me a code for a 20% discount off of a new, previous-gen pixel 8 or 9 (lol).  \n\nI absolutely love the Pixel brand and have been purchasing Pixel and Google hardware since the Pixel 3, including Buds, Watches, Speakers, smart devices, and more.  \n\nI wanted to know if others have experienced this, or if someone could help me. \n\n",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

    "selftext": "I was a Galaxy user for about 10 years (starting with the S1 until the S7) and one thing that always drove me crazy was how my phones would slow down after a year or two. I eventually switched to iPhone with the 12 Pro, and 5 years later it still feels just as smooth as the day I got it.\n\nNow I’m considering going back to Android with the S26, but I don’t want to deal with the same old performance issues if Samsung hasn’t really fixed this.\n\nFor those of you who’ve stuck with Samsung in recent years, how does long-term performance hold up? Are they still prone to slowing down or is it finally on par with iOS for longevity?",

They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. \n3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. \n4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don’t have to do that anymore. \n5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.\n\nQuirks\n- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed. I would like to have a simple play button (which would do AI wash) for my parents and my young daughter who I’m going to start to train to load and start. ",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use?

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

Btw the objective was to see which Magic Eraser works better. Although Samsungs eraser was sooo much better... but on a different picture. Because my camera couldn't capture one vehicle in the background clearly.\n\nI do have Quick Tap Shutter on and Prioritize Focus over speed off. I thought Samsung could do better because it's pretty much iPhone 15 or 16 equivalent. Idk I thought camera was kinda close to iPhone but phone camers, i think iPhone wins hands down.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

It's not like the watch is hung, but on the activity screen it will keep showing only which HR Zones you are on right now. Pressing the button would let you pause or resume activity but the HR screen just remains and won't let you see the other vital information. The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time. Later I found a work around, you need to open Samsung Health app on your phone then select the activity again which kinda resets the screen, but this is such a hassle to do mid ride when you can't even see the time. I used a Galaxy Watch 4 for a short time and it never had this problem, only on my new watch I'm experiencing this bug. \n\nAnyone else experienceing this issue?",

I have two areas the user can customize the face. In Watch Face Studio, the labels default to Setting 1 and Setting 2. How do I change this to text of my choosing? I can't seem to find anywhere in the interface to do this.  \n",

So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

I don't want that. I want it to turn off after 30 sec that I actually chosed in the settings. \n\nI'm about to return this awful thing and go back to Garmin. I'm so frustrated. \n\nIf someone can help me with this I would be forever grateful. ",

    "selftext": "Bought my GW Ultra late last year when they were giving insane deals/trade-ins and was blown away by how good it was.  However, over the last few months, my HR has been becoming completely unusable as the numbers would jump around so much that I knew they weren't correct.  (I've been a distance runner for almost twenty years so I know my HR very well and I knew the watch was giving poor info.)  I've had a couple of forced resets of my watch and even starting over from scratch has not improved things.\n\nFor my birthday last week, I got a gift card to Amazon and I decided to finally purchase a HR monitor with a chest strap.  Found an unbelievable deal on one for only $20 and thought I'd try it.  Today, on its first run, I saw just how bad my Ultra was really performing.\n\nIn the pic below, the top picture is the still very new Ultra during a 2.5 mile run.  It climbs steadily until reaching my \"cruising\" HR, which will usually be between 145-155, depending on my exertion level that day.  The top pic is very acceptable to me.  I was doing a lot of HR zone training back then and with a good HR sensor, it was easily accomplished.\n\nThe bottom pic is today's run, a 1.55 mile treadmill run.  (Sorry, it was 38 degrees and raining, so not going outside!)  You can see a very similar HR pattern as the new Ultra had in the top pic.  A steady climb into the cruising zone and stayed there for the duration.  Never got above 150 the entire time.\n\nThe middle pic is yesterday's run, one mile on the treadmill using the Ultra only.  Wow, what a disaster.  All over the place and a couple of minute-long flatlines.  Also, notice the high of 171, which I know my heart never came near.  Definitely a cadence-lock issue, because my running cadence is always between 168 and 174.\n\nI'm one of those tactile-intolerant people and I thought for sure I'd hate running with this strap on my chest but I barely even noticed it the entire time.  The beauty is, once SportWerks has discovered the BLE device, it is stored and it will automatically find the device every time in the future so as long as I remember to put it on, it's as simple as that.\n\nNot sure why these things simply \"go bad\" but apparently, mine has.  Sharing this because I've seen enough posts from other runners/cyclists to know they are also having HR sensor issues.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn17yc8ijxwf1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=91a25d27193cc4e24239c1554d50b2a76870b84e\n\n",

    "selftext": "I recently got myself a Galaxy Watch 8 and on my first cycling activity ever the HR zones guide screen got stuck during the activity. It's not like the watch is hung, but on the activity screen it will keep showing only which HR Zones you are on right now. Pressing the button would let you pause or resume activity but the HR screen just remains and won't let you see the other vital information. The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time. Later I found a work around, you need to open Samsung Health app on your phone then select the activity again which kinda resets the screen, but this is such a hassle to do mid ride when you can't even see the time. I used a Galaxy Watch 4 for a short time and it never had this problem, only on my new watch I'm experiencing this bug. \n\nAnyone else experienceing this issue?",

    "selftext": "I usually get around 2.5 days(almost 3 if I strech it) on a full charge. Completely different story if lte is on tho.\n\nI track my sleep everyday. Last night as I was going to bed I noticed the batter was @ 11% and couldn't be bothered to wait for it to charge. So I turned of Bluetooth, then put airplane mode so lte dosent turn on nd then tucked in for the night.\n\nThis morning I wake up, lo nd behold the battery has gone down just 3%! Usually it consumes almost 12 to 15% everynight. Not just that, I reconnected it to my phone and it had tracked my sleep(along with hr and breathing) properly like it does everyday.\n\nThe thing is, in the battery section of settings it just shows what apps are using the battery which all combined isn't even 20%. \n\nSo, while being connected to the phone while your awake is non negotiable, ig it works if u want to just make it last a little longer in case u don't want to turn health features off \n\nEdit: what a weird coincidence, that someone asked a question on batter drain during night as I was writing this post, lol\n\nEdit2: corrected first line from hrs to days, sry",

I even have some customisation in place with the \"Custom wear notification\" app.\n\nHowever one of the most important features that made me buy a watch is to receive notifications even when phone and watch are not connected to each other.\n\nRight now if the watch is not connected to the phone and I receive a notification for an app that's installed on the watch (e.g: Whatsapp) I still get the notification, both on the phone and on the watch with the Lte connection, however, that's not the case if the app is not available on wear os (e.g: Telegram, Incident.io, ...). And for those I only receive the notification on the phone.\n\nIs there anyway, I can still receive all apps notifications if they are not installed on the watch, and the watch and phone are not connected?\n\ne.g:\nTelegram -> send notification to phone -> phone send notification remotely to the watch",

It's not like the watch is hung, but on the activity screen it will keep showing only which HR Zones you are on right now. Pressing the button would let you pause or resume activity but the HR screen just remains and won't let you see the other vital information. The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time. Later I found a work around, you need to open Samsung Health app on your phone then select the activity again which kinda resets the screen, but this is such a hassle to do mid ride when you can't even see the time. I used a Galaxy Watch 4 for a short time and it never had this problem, only on my new watch I'm experiencing this bug. \n\nAnyone else experienceing this issue?",

This has been an issue since the beginning but randomly stopped being rough to the point of wearing down my stylus nib for a while (you could still tell there was friction there though), and now it has suddenly become very rough again? when i run my fingernail over it it sounds scratchy and in the centre of the ring it also makes a squeaky noise when i rub it with a wet towel and is a little rough. \n\nHow on earth do I fix this? What caused this?",

Recently, the display started flickering at random intervals — sometimes once in a while, sometimes more often.\n\nI haven’t dropped it or closed the lid roughly. The laptop is in great shape.  \nHere’s what I’ve already tried:\n\n* Updated both GPU drivers (integrated + dedicated)\n* Changed refresh rate between 60Hz and 144Hz\n* Tried both battery and plugged-in power\n* Checked for Windows and BIOS updates\n\nIt still flickers no matter what. I’m not sure if it’s a loose hinge cable or a display panel issue.\n\nIf anyone’s faced this before or knows what might be happening, I’d appreciate any insights.  \n(I have a short clip showing the flicker if needed — can share it in comments.)",

I’m a college student, so I’ll be using it mostly for schoolwork, research, and my thesis. I need something reliable that can handle multitasking smoothly and last me for a long time.\n\nI’m thinking of getting a laptop with a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 processor since I’ve heard they offer great performance for their price. What I’m really after is something durable, smooth, and long-lasting. Good battery life would also be nice since I’ll be using it around campus most of the time. A touchscreen would be great too, pero not naman sha need talaga\n\nI’ll need Windows for school since most of my programs and tools require it. Aside from academic stuff, I also do light video editing and mga PubMaths. I’m not a heavy gamer, but I’d love it if my laptop could handle light gaming in the future since open naman ako.\n\nMy budget is around ₱30,000 to ₱50,000, though I’m open to spending less kung pwede. So far, I’ve been looking at the HP Pavilion and the Acer Aspire Lite 15, but I’m still not sure which one gives the best value for money.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions for specific models available here in the Philippines or tips on what specs I should focus on, I’d really appreciate it. I just want something that feels smooth to use, lasts long, and can keep up with me through college and beyond. Thanks in advance for the help!",

The system has **6 GB of installed RAM**, but **only 2.84 GB is usable** in Windows 10.\n\n# 🔍 System Details:\n\n* **Model:** Coolby Yealbook BCL540\n* **Processor:** Intel Celeron J4005 (Gemini Lake-DT)\n* **Installed RAM:** 6 GB DDR4 (soldered to the motherboard)\n* **Usable RAM:** 2.84 GB\n* **Operating System:** Windows 10 64-bit\n* **BIOS Vendor:** American Megatrends Inc.\n* **BIOS Version:** GL116\n* **BIOS Date:** 2022-06-27\n* **SMBIOS Version:** 3.2\n* **Board ID:** Default String (not properly identified)\n* **CPU Codename:** Gemini Lake-DT\n\n# 🧠 What I've tried:\n\n* Confirmed that the OS is 64-bit.\n* Used tools like `wmic`, CPU-Z, HWiNFO, Speccy, and AIDA64 — all show “Default String” as the motherboard model.\n* Checked Coolby’s official website, but **my model (BCL540) is not listed**, and no BIOS files are available.\n* Considered searching for BIOS updates by chipset (Gemini Lake), but I don’t want to risk flashing a generic version without confirmation.\n\n# 🎯 Goal:\n\nI want to **unlock more usable RAM**. I suspect the current BIOS reserves too much memory for integrated graphics or has a firmware limitation that could be fixed with an update or advanced configuration.\n\n# ❓ Questions:\n\n1. Has anyone with this model successfully updated the BIOS?\n2. Is there a newer version of BIOS GL116 available for this laptop?\n3. Is there a safe way to adjust memory reserved for graphics in the BIOS?\n4. Can any BIOS modder help analyze a dump of my current BIOS if I extract it?\n\nAny guidance, experience, or files you can share would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

At idle it has also dropped the temps by ~10°C with the fans set to ~1300rpm- but I have always had fairly high idle temps for whatever reason, so I imagine that's more specific to me.\n\nAnd lastly, I've needed to open up my laptop every 6-12months to clean out the car hair that would massively build up from having two fur ball cats in my small'ish room (n with my laptop pretty much being a stationary PC that's always around them), and so I also don't need to do this anymore given that this has the seal+filter, so that's of course suuuper nice too lol. A fairly personal/specific additional \"plus\", but if you happen to be in my same position at all, I double-highly recommend it!\n\nSoooo yeah, just wanted to throw this out there in case anyone on this sub isn't already aware of how bombbbb these are. OH, and it was the ~$50 \"no name\"-brand (or at least not one of the main big cooling pads brands) one- not sure if the lower-tier $30ish (IIRC) one would have similar results (totally possible given that the full 2700rpm fan speed isn't really necessary- at least for my specific laptop), and double-OH, another important point is that my laptop has the bottom filled with openings for the intake fans, so if your laptop isn't as wide open down there, you might not get the same results- something to keep in mind!",

My primary goal is to use this laptop for learning data analysis, including tools and tasks such as Excel, Python, and data visualization libraries.\n\nHere are the specifications I’m looking for:\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i5 (12th or 13th Gen) or AMD Ryzen 5/7, to ensure smooth multitasking and efficient performance for data analysis applications.\n\nRAM: 16GB, to comfortably run multiple programs like VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, and Excel simultaneously.\n\nStorage: 512GB SSD, for fast boot times, quick file access, and handling datasets efficiently.\n\nDisplay: 14–16 inch Full HD (FHD), providing clear visuals and enough screen space for working with spreadsheets and coding.\n\nBuild Quality: Must be sturdy and durable, capable of withstanding regular use without hinge or chassis issues.\n\nKeyboard: Backlit preferred, helpful for working in low-light conditions.\n\n\nI’m seeking advice on the best laptop that balances durability, performance, and longevity within this budget, specifically for someone learning and practicing data analysis. Any personal experiences, comparisons, or expert insights would be extremely helpful.\n\nThank you in advance for your guidance!\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi there! I have a 15-inch MacBook Pro from 2018. The keys are starting to fall off and I’m currently visiting the US where electronics tend to be more affordable than where I live (Germany), so we’re considering an upgrade.\n\nMy main use is writing (Scrivener, Google Docs) and editing video for social media and YouTube. I’m not doing any massive special effects. The editing is very basic / straight forward. I also travel quite a bit, so something easy to travel with would be great, too.\n\nI’m not married to sticking with Apple, by the way. But I purchased my Final Cut Pro through the App Store, and since I’m not doing anything too fancy with my videos, I presume it makes the most sense to stick with Apple. But I’m generally open to suggestions! Thanks in advance.",

    "selftext": "Last November, I bought a Samsung galaxy book 4 ultra with the intel core i9 , Nvidia 4070, and Samsung care plus. I bought it to play games and do work, but I stopped playing games a while ago, and would rather have a smaller laptop to do work. I tried looking online for galaxy book 4 ultras for sale, but only found the ones with the 4050. Right now I don’t have it since I had to mail it in to get the screen replaced. I wanted to know how much I could get for it. I’m in the United States, specifically Dallas, TX area. Right now it’s $3,150 USD and I was wondering if I could possibly get 2500 from it. I lost the box so it only comes with the charger. Should I just put it for sale and see how much I could get for it or just keep it since laptops lose their value fast.  ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI recently bought this laptop, and I feel like the screen isn’t bright enough and the colors look really dark. Even though it’s advertised as 2K, it’s actually just 1920 FHD. My girlfriend’s HP (I think it’s a 15-inch IPS model) looks way better in comparison.\nI mostly need a laptop for school and very light gaming (integrated graphics are fine). My budget is around $800, maybe slightly higher. Are there any options with a better screen quality that I should consider?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Right now my pick is the [https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Display-NVIDIA%C2%AE-i7-13650HX-G614JV-AS74/dp/B0F1C665XL?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Display-NVIDIA%C2%AE-i7-13650HX-G614JV-AS74/dp/B0F1C665XL?th=1) but I have no idea if this will suffice for my requirements.

The shaking becomes noticeable when the laptop is charging, when I move the screen, or when I open apps, and it even appears on the boot screen before Windows loads. I’ve already tried restarting and booting into Safe Mode, but that didn’t help. Interestingly, screenshots look perfectly fine, which makes me think it’s not a GPU issue. Could this be caused by a loose display cable, hinge connection, or some other hardware fault? I’d really appreciate some expert opinions before spending money on a new display.",

I was thinking I'm going away after 2 weeks so in any case, someone at home might need it. I already clean my own laptop (Asus Tuf) I thought lets give this a shot.\n\nHad some tools purchased for this already.",

At idle it has also dropped the temps by ~10°C with the fans set to ~1300rpm- but I have always had fairly high idle temps for whatever reason, so I imagine that's more specific to me.\n\nAnd lastly, I've needed to open up my laptop every 6-12months to clean out the car hair that would massively build up from having two fur ball cats in my small'ish room (n with my laptop pretty much being a stationary PC that's always around them), and so I also don't need to do this anymore given that this has the seal+filter, so that's of course suuuper nice too lol. A fairly personal/specific additional \"plus\", but if you happen to be in my same position at all, I double-highly recommend it!\n\nSoooo yeah, just wanted to throw this out there in case anyone on this sub isn't already aware of how bombbbb these are. OH, and it was the ~$50 \"no name\"-brand (or at least not one of the main big cooling pads brands) one- not sure if the lower-tier $30ish (IIRC) one would have similar results (totally possible given that the full 2700rpm fan speed isn't really necessary- at least for my specific laptop), and double-OH, another important point is that my laptop has the bottom filled with openings for the intake fans, so if your laptop isn't as wide open down there, you might not get the same results- something to keep in mind!",

The laptop is in great shape.  \nHere’s what I’ve already tried:\n\n* Updated both GPU drivers (integrated + dedicated)\n* Changed refresh rate between 60Hz and 144Hz\n* Tried both battery and plugged-in power\n* Checked for Windows and BIOS updates\n\nIt still flickers no matter what. I’m not sure if it’s a loose hinge cable or a display panel issue.\n\nIf anyone’s faced this before or knows what might be happening, I’d appreciate any insights.  \n(I have a short clip showing the flicker if needed — can share it in comments.)",

A touchscreen would be great too, pero not naman sha need talaga\n\nI’ll need Windows for school since most of my programs and tools require it. Aside from academic stuff, I also do light video editing and mga PubMaths. I’m not a heavy gamer, but I’d love it if my laptop could handle light gaming in the future since open naman ako.\n\nMy budget is around ₱30,000 to ₱50,000, though I’m open to spending less kung pwede. So far, I’ve been looking at the HP Pavilion and the Acer Aspire Lite 15, but I’m still not sure which one gives the best value for money.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions for specific models available here in the Philippines or tips on what specs I should focus on, I’d really appreciate it. I just want something that feels smooth to use, lasts long, and can keep up with me through college and beyond. Thanks in advance for the help!",

At idle it has also dropped the temps by ~10°C with the fans set to ~1300rpm- but I have always had fairly high idle temps for whatever reason, so I imagine that's more specific to me.\n\nAnd lastly, I've needed to open up my laptop every 6-12months to clean out the car hair that would massively build up from having two fur ball cats in my small'ish room (n with my laptop pretty much being a stationary PC that's always around them), and so I also don't need to do this anymore given that this has the seal+filter, so that's of course suuuper nice too lol. A fairly personal/specific additional \"plus\", but if you happen to be in my same position at all, I double-highly recommend it!\n\nSoooo yeah, just wanted to throw this out there in case anyone on this sub isn't already aware of how bombbbb these are. OH, and it was the ~$50 \"no name\"-brand (or at least not one of the main big cooling pads brands) one- not sure if the lower-tier $30ish (IIRC) one would have similar results (totally possible given that the full 2700rpm fan speed isn't really necessary- at least for my specific laptop), and double-OH, another important point is that my laptop has the bottom filled with openings for the intake fans, so if your laptop isn't as wide open down there, you might not get the same results- something to keep in mind!",

I built a budget gaming PC during the pandemic, but it's starting to show its age.\n\nSince I'm a big Anno fan, I'm a little concerned about the system requirements for Anno 117 and would like to optimize something. I've already played the beta, but had to play everything at the lowest resolution and the FPS wasn't particularly good (unfortunately, I haven’t measured it).\n\nOtherwise, I mainly play CS2 and PUBG.\n\nMy current components are:\n- AMD Ryzen 5 2600\n- 8GB XFX Radeon RX 570 RS\n- MSI B450 Gaming Plus MAX\n- 650 Watt Seasonic S12III\n\nI don't have a budget, but it should make sense. I don't currently play demanding games, but I would like to keep that option open. Otherwise, it would be important to me that the upgrade lasts for a few years.\n\nWhat do you think, is it worth upgrading individual components (such as a 3060 12GB), or should I generally replace/rebuild more?\n\nAdditional information: I live in Germany and have no problem with used parts, although I feel that the prices for used parts are often much too high.",

Right now, I am using the Lenovo Legion 5 pro with the Nvidia 3060 (which does the job frankly). But I'm looking to game at 4k with high settings, and some occasional editing stuff (Davinci Resolve). I have been out of the pc build space for some time and I'm thoroughly confused with the entire gamut of options available.\n\nHere is something I came up with:\n1. CPU: AMD RYZEN 7 9800X3D/7800X3D\n2. GPU: ZOTAC NVIDIA 5080 SOLID OC 16GB\n3. RAM: 32GB 6000 MHZ (any brand will do)\n4. SSD: Crucial p310 gen4 1TB M.2 NVME\n5. Cooler: Any 360mm AIO cooler\n6. PSU: Anything 850W and modular\n7. Case: Anything that is good enough for this build ( was looking at Antec full towers)\n\nI don't know if this is a good build, especially with the CPU. Here are my questions.\n\n1. Please suggest if I should go with the 7800x3d or the 9800x3d. Are there any gains with the 9800x3d if paired with the 5080?\n2. Is the ZOTAC Nvidia 5080 solid OC a good card? Is there a point in going with more expensive ones?\n3. Is there any point to increasing the RAM to 64GB? Should 32GB be fine?\n4. What's with all these white edition components out there? Are they just for show?\n\nIt would be really helpful if anyone could suggest something. I don't have much expertise and all suggestions would be helpful. Thanks in advance.",

    "title": "Troubleshooting Hell: Fixed 'No Display/Intermittent Power' issue, now have 'Rear Audio Static'. Hardware fault?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm at the end of my rope with a PC problem that has evolved. I fixed the initial \"no boot\" issue, but now I have a new hardware-level problem. I've done a ton of troubleshooting and I'm looking for some expert opinions.\n\n# My Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 3600\n* **Motherboard:** ASRock B450M-HDV R4.0\n* **RAM:** 8GB DDR4 3200MHz\n* **Cooler:** Deepcool AK400\n* **GPU:** GT 1030\n* **PSU:** Corsair VS 450\n\n# The Original Problem:\n\nMy PC was working fine for a long time, then it suddenly started to fail.\n\n1. **Intermittent Power:** Sometimes pressing the power button did nothing. Other times, it would power on.\n2. **No Display:** When it *did* power on (fans spinning, lights on), I would **never** get a display output.\n\n# How I Fixed the \"No Display\" Issue:\n\nI went through the full troubleshooting gauntlet. I...\n\n* Tried a different, known-good GPU.\n* Reseated my RAM multiple times.\n* Checked and re-plugged every single power cable (24-pin, 8-pin CPU, etc.).\n* My motherboard has no debug LEDs.\n* I finally did a **full teardown**. I removed the motherboard, uninstalled the Ryzen 5 3600, cleaned it, re-applied thermal paste, and re-assembled everything.\n\n# The NEW Problem:\n\nThe good news: The PC now boots reliably and I get a display. Windows loads fine.\n\nThe bad news: I have **loud, constant static and no actual sound** coming from the **rear green audio port** (plugged directly into the motherboard I/O).\n\n# Troubleshooting I've ALREADY Done for the Audio:\n\n1. **Tested in Linux:** This is the most important part. I booted into a live Ubuntu USB, and the **exact same static problem happens there.** This confirms it is a **hardware problem**, not a Windows or driver issue.\n2. **Checked BIOS:** I went into the ASRock BIOS and changed `Onboard HD Audio` from `AUTO` to `Enabled`. \n3. **Reinstalled Drivers:** Even though I knew it was hardware, I uninstalled the Realtek audio device in Windows (checking \"Delete the driver software\") and reinstalled. It didn't help.\n4. **Checked Front Panel Audio:** I've plugged in the `HD_AUDIO` front panel cable, but this shouldn't matter since I'm testing from the rear port.\n\n# My Question:\n\nGiven that it's a hardware fault that appeared after a full rebuild, what's the most likely cause?\n\n* Is it possible the onboard audio chip was damaged by the earlier intermittent power failures?\n* Is it more likely I bent one of the I/O shield's metal grounding tabs *into* the green audio port, causing a physical short?\n\nI'm one step away from just buying a USB audio adapter, but I'd love to know if there's anything else I can check. Thanks for your time.",

I’ve been considering upgrading to a 9600x, but my budget has recently increased a bit, so I’m not sure if i should go with something different due to this.

I currently have a 4060ti OC and am worried that if I upgrade my CPU to something other than/better than a 9600x, it'll be overkill and not worth it for my GPU. I'm not sure if upgrading my GPU as well as my CPU would be worth it, or if I should just focus on upgrading my CPU.\n\nIn terms of usage, I mainly play Fortnite at high settings at 1440p. I do schoolwork on my PC and like to multitask when playing games (game on first monitor, video/chrome tabs on second monitor). I'd like to keep the entire upgrade under $1000.\n\nI’m planning on getting cl30 2x16 6000mhz ram, and am looking at getting the Gigabyte B850m Aorus Elite Wifi 6 for the motherboard. My build is entirely white, so I would prefer for a new GPU to be white.\n\nAny input or advice is appreciated!",

It can completely freeze, kernel panic or reboot without notice. I tried multiple other Linux OS: Chimera, Pop OS, Kubuntu, Mint and even Windows. They all had the same issue. Im just not sure what to do and I cant really diagnose the machine much cuz it crashes almost every time. \nTemps on the cpu seems fine, in 40s idle & 70s in gaming. Yeah in the beginning, i could game a bit when Chimera OS was installed but after a while it would freeze.\nAlso the case is very small, airflow might not be the best but as i say, temps seems fine except for AUXTIN0, AUXTIN3 & TMPIN4. Idk what these are but the temps are kinda extreme i think. In 80s-90s degrees.\nI really need help! \n\nMy specs:\nRyzen 5 5500\nAsus TUF a520 WiFi Mobo\nRadeon RX 7600\n16gb ram 3200mhz\nCorsair CX650 PSU\n",

Right now, I'm having a huge issue with the monitors consistently going out. The monitors are brand new, but they just keep going dark on me. Theyll either randomly go dark at some points, never even turn on on the first place, or randomly just go completely white or purple. On top of this the computer itself just kinda starts stuttering. \n\nFrom what I've done, I don't seem to have a virus and I've been troubleshooting but at this point my brains just like, \"Has the computer just reached its end?\". I can't seem to fix much of it, though I've been planning on buying a new one this year\n\nI can't name every single special off the top of my head, so sorry in advance but my specs I remember are:\nAMD Ryzen 5 3600 (I think) \nGTX 1080\n16gb Ram\n\nAnd that's about it.

    "selftext": "With the current Amazon sale going on, I’m looking for a good-value 360mm AIO under $130 for my 7800X3D. (Yeah, I know it doesn’t really need an AIO, but I prefer the aesthetics.)\n\nSo far, I’ve found a few that seem decent for the price, but if I don’t need to spend the full $130, that’d be even better. My main priority is that it runs quietly.\n\nI was originally looking at the FW 360 Ultra ARGB, since the screen looks really nice, but I’ve heard that the software has to stay open 24/7 for the screen to work. Apparently, when it’s running in the background, it constantly scans your drives and can severely impact FPS, which is a big red flag for me.\n\nA budget-friendly option would be great, but if those issues with the FW 360’s software aren’t actually a problem, I wouldn’t mind paying a bit extra for it. Still, it’s about a $50 difference compared to the cheaper ones I’ve found (linked below), and I’m worried that if I go too cheap — like with the Frozen Notte Aqua Elite 360 V3 — it might end up being really loud.\n\nAny help or advice would be greatly appreciated, as I’m planning to buy one today before the sales end. If it matters I'm in Australia but most aios I can find on Amazon and if it's not on sale for you feel free to still show me as it could be on sale for me\n\n\nhttps://amzn.asia/d/cNSEc0V\n\nhttps://amzn.asia/d/j0GNmTG\n\nhttps://amzn.asia/d/aTEhgtI\n\nhttps://amzn.asia/d/hiey1zR\n\nhttps://amzn.asia/d/3tu9r6c\n",

From the research that I've done all of these parts should be ok, but I wanted real end user feedback. I'm hoping to get just as many years from this new build as I did the last! Some very specific question that I have are\n\nIs the Lian Li AIO a good choice? I'm looking to run as little RGB software as possible between the fans and pump, which is why I'm choosing the same brand AIO as the case fans with the daisy link system\n\nIs the RAM selected a good fit for the build being DDR5-6000 CL30?\n\nI'm sorry for this being such a long post and a lot to discuss/ digest. Full disclosure, I have already purchased the CPU, Motherboard, RAM, Case, Power Supply, and some of the Lian Li fans. Thanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "This is my first time building a pc myself and wanted an outside opinion on the parts I picked before I start buying them. \n\nI would need the PC to be able to do a few things including: run art programs, video editing/content creation, light programing and some casual gaming like: Minecraft, Stardew Valley, ect. ect.\n\nHere's the parts I've chosen so far:\n[PC part picker list]\n(https://pcpartpicker.com/list/TbrDt3)\n**CPU:** Intel core i5-13400\n**CPU cooler:** cooler master hyper 212 rgb\n**GPU:** MSI GeForce nvidia RTX 3060 12gb  \n**Motherboard:** ASrock B760 Pro RS Wifi \n**Ram:** Silicon Power XPower Zenith gaming 16gb x2  \n**Storage(SSD):** PNY CS2230 1TB M.2-2280 x1 \n**PSU:** BeQuiet! Pure Power 12 M 650w\n**Case:** Vetroo AL800 ATX mid tower\n**Case fans:** NZXT F120 RGB core 120mm x2\n\nSome specific questions I have:\n\n*Is 750w too much? I want enough wiggle room incase I want to upgrade some parts later, but not too much that it\"s a wate of money. It also needs 2 ESP 8pin connectors for the current motherboard.\n\n*Is the motherboard good? I was having trouble trying to choose one that I liked.\n\n*I used few bottleneck calculators and most of them say I have a gpu bottleneck but it's mostly at higher resolutions than my monitor, and I don't plan on getting a new one at the momment. Should I still get a different gpu? If so, which ones would you recomend?\n\nThe Budget is about $1000 USD. I'm planing on getting some of the parts second hand to save some money, if you have any tips on that, please leave them aswell.",

The games I've played most are RDR2, Witcher 3, Apex Legends, Dota 2. I plan on playing more modern AAA games eventually. \n\nIn my country, upgrading to 5700x3d costs $100 less than upgrading to AM5 (7600, b650, 32gb cl32 6000mhz) IF I could sell my AM4 parts.\n\nFor GPU (that fits in my case), the cheapest 5070 (Palit) is $630, Gigabyte 9070 at $680. 5070 ti and 9070 xt are $800+  so its already beyond my budget.\n\nI plan on upgrading the monitor first since I feel that would have the biggest impact on my overall experience, GPU 2nd and CPU last. Is this sound strategy? Outside of gaming, I don't have a lot of productivity apps (mostly Excel, Sheets, Lightroom). I plan to upgrade every 5 years minimum.\n\nAlso should I just jump to AM5 given the prices stated above?\n\nThanks a lot.",

    "selftext": "I use a 2018-era Dell laptop (which I need to last me until I can get something newer, lol) running Windows 10 and plan to keep it at that.\n\nAs the title says. I'm no complete stranger to the world of drives but am also not a tech wizard either. I can follow the \"basics\" of drive information for the most part but there are SO many options and things to consider that my braind shuts down trying to even begin to decide what I should get.\n\nHere's my situation - I'm an autistic music collector (literally, thank you). I have several 8TB drives completely full of carefully curated and collected collections of hundreds of artists. My hobby is collecting/archiving/listening to live music mostly, so it's all Phish>Phish 1991>91 04 09 Colorado Springs\n\netc\n\nYou get the idea. For about 500 artists :P This collection has been curated by me since roughly 2008 or so. Basically, I currently have everything backed up on 2 large WD 8tb \"brick\" drives since about 2020 - one for audio and one for video\n\nBut my \"daily use\" drives are two WD MyPassport Ultras - one is 2TB and one is 5TB. Both are nearly full and have been going 6 or 7 years at this point. I've had, in that time I had one other one the same that just died randomly (click of death syndrome) and another that died when I dropped it from about a foot in the air by accident, but of course that's on me.\n\nPoint is, WD has treated me good so far but I'm definitely worried about their age and condition considering they are used hours a day, constantly in use with files being moved/re-arranged/listened to etc They are also often in my bag being used out at Starbucks or the Library, etc etc. I am always very conscious and careful of how I pack and transport them. I very carefully place them on the table, in my bag, don't jostle them ,etc\n\nMy gut is telling me I need to upgrade very, very soon (yesterday!) before these die on me. Everything is backed up on those 2 8TB drives that get plugged in every month or two for updates.\n\nI've seen people suggest getting, say, an 8 or 10TB SSD without an enclosure and sticking it in one and basically making another external drive. I'm down for that but wouldn't know where to start regarding specifics or tech info, etc. (2.5 vs 3.5, RAM this, MB that, etc)\n\nAnyone got any help or suggestions for me? My budget is the lower the better - can't afford over $150-175ish\n\n  \nThanks!! :D",

Storage and ram aren't really needed since I have some pretty good storage and a good spot to stop for ram. I also am using Windows 11 Ghost Spectre if that matters at all.\n\nIf anyone could give me any opinions then I need them soon because I'm trying to get this done and over with so my PCVR performance isn't extremely buggy.\n\nOne last thing that I would like help on is that I will be buying the parts in two different segments likely 300$ before Christmas and 300$ on Christmas.\n\nIf I don't get responses quickly I'm gonna buy a PSU and probably do some more overall research using AI and my last 3 braincells.

    "selftext": "Greetings Fellow Nerds! \n\nI did a custom build a few years ago. It has worked great!\n\nBut ... my work recently issued work laptops and shut off my RDP over VPN solution. So I find myself needing to switch frequently between my laptop/thunderbolt-4 docking station and PC. It is a bit of a pain to move the cables back and forth.\n\nI right now have the [MSI Z760-P motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-ProSeries-Motherboard-Supports-Processors/dp/B0BRQSWSFQ/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2NLA75N82H02Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WKEZCpQ-N01mlgM3zgcIP5OTLu_apqKp9nKcup9Z4hdE13_1tsa4qPzSeOBzpqrYmXppK_HXJ5Jc5uoH9uiHvtsVNJeQyY-z4fm1EsgNxK4bcmVEwJFjbQTOmyMQC7jWAGNu2G_KTT058OyHwsTKbawI8-yWHQppCyUCcHx-5bDyIJG2DlR5faMlf9xXsidDkP2pRkuWR-OGOKjvMafwzvhcn7Bki4Z0T8jLSln8ETg.RVuTLMmwItdhTmBsSAjfcarzCTyIga3aE6_Kr9-dCIo&dib_tag=se&keywords=z760%2Bmotherboard&qid=1761434315&sprefix=z760%2Bmotherboar%2Caps%2C195&sr=8-4&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.9fe8cbfa-bf43-43d1-a707-3f4e65a4b666&th=1) with LGA1700 socket, which if I have read right, lacks thunderbolt 4 support. I read about the PCI-E add-in cards, but those seemed to cost as much if not more than a thunderbolt-4 enabled board itself, with numerous compatibility questions. Does anyone know if I have interpreted this correctly? If not, I would be exceptionally grateful!\n\nAssuming yes, does anyone have recommendations for a cheap'ish quality board? \n\nMemory performance is not that important to me, and I don't overclock - computer is used mostly for my machine learning adventures. It would need to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth integrated!\n\nAnd right now, my dock only supports a single PC with no switching, so if there are recommendations on cheap and robust 2-device docking stations also wonderful! \n\nThank-you so much :) \n\n",

    "selftext": "Since the release of the RTX 5080, there’s been a lots of issues - from ridiculous pricing to overheating and melting reports. I decided to wait for the 5080 Ti, hoping Nvidia would fix those problems, but I’ve come to realize it’s probably never coming. And even if it does, it’ll be overpriced as hell.\n\nSo I started looking for alternatives.  \nRight now, I see three realistic options:\n\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** \\- around €950 in my country. Slightly lower performance, but much better value.\n* **RX 9070 XT** \\-  about €750, even stronger price/performance ratio. The thing is… I’ve been burned by AMD drivers before. My old 6800 XT literally died because of them, and DLSS still beats even the newest FSR in both quality and adoption.\n* **RTX 5080** \\- averages €1340. I'm just afraid of this card. I've heard only bad things about it. And it's cost almost twice as best AMD GPU.\n\nFor reference, here’s my current setup:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS TUF GAMING X570-PLUS (Wi-Fi)\n* **RAM:** 32 GB DDR4 @ 4,396 MHz\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n* **Main monitor:** 1440p HDR\n* **Secondary:** 1440p (YouTube / multitasking)\n* **PSU:** be quiet! Pure Power 12 M 1200 W (yeah, I know, overkill)\n\nMy 3080 Ti is starting to choke on newer titles, and the lack of access to modern upscaling tech is becoming noticeable.  \nIt sucks that so much of GPU performance now relies on software tricks, but here we are.\n\nSo… what would you do in my place?",

    "selftext": "Hey PC builders/experts, I need some quick advice on my current setup's SATA power situation. I'm using the only available SATA power cable (PSU Cosire CX750, white lettering on black label) that has three connectors coming off it.\n\nThis one cable is powering:\n\nAn 10-fan fan controller (currently running 8 ARGB case fans).\nTwo HDDs. One connector for controller and other two for HDDs\n\nMy concern is whether this single cable might become overwhelmed or draw too much current powering all those devices simultaneously, leading to potential instability or damage.\n\nIs this configuration safe ?\n\nTL;DR: One SATA power cable from PSU is feeding an 10-fan controller with 8ARGB fans connected and two HDDs. Is this safe?",

That's part of why I went with the ryzen 7600 instead of an intel i5 – read that the i5s are a bit more power hungry/less efficient. Also, went with the 7600 instead of 7500f so I'd have integrated graphics for troubleshooting in case the GPU ever has any issues. \n\nHoping this gets me by for another five to ten years.\n\nI think 64gb of ram is likely overkill, so definitely willing to drop that to 32 if there's consensus on that. Quick notes on why I'm considering it though: I'm a major multi-tasker often with four or five applications open at a time (browser with too many tabs, guitar emulation software, ableton, some random game running in the background, Discord, etc.) and if computers were sentient my tab usage would be a war crime. I'm coming from 16gb ddr4-2133 that maxes out with just the OS + Firefox though, and don't have a sense of how big of a difference 32gb of quality ddr5 would be compared to this.",

I've already played the beta, but had to play everything at the lowest resolution and the FPS wasn't particularly good (unfortunately, I haven’t measured it).\n\nOtherwise, I mainly play CS2 and PUBG.\n\nMy current components are:\n- AMD Ryzen 5 2600\n- 8GB XFX Radeon RX 570 RS\n- MSI B450 Gaming Plus MAX\n- 650 Watt Seasonic S12III\n\nI don't have a budget, but it should make sense. I don't currently play demanding games, but I would like to keep that option open. Otherwise, it would be important to me that the upgrade lasts for a few years.\n\nWhat do you think, is it worth upgrading individual components (such as a 3060 12GB), or should I generally replace/rebuild more?\n\nAdditional information: I live in Germany and have no problem with used parts, although I feel that the prices for used parts are often much too high.",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI have been using a gaming laptop for a fairly long time and looking to build a pc now. Right now, I am using the Lenovo Legion 5 pro with the Nvidia 3060 (which does the job frankly). But I'm looking to game at 4k with high settings, and some occasional editing stuff (Davinci Resolve). I have been out of the pc build space for some time and I'm thoroughly confused with the entire gamut of options available.\n\nHere is something I came up with:\n1. CPU: AMD RYZEN 7 9800X3D/7800X3D\n2. GPU: ZOTAC NVIDIA 5080 SOLID OC 16GB\n3. RAM: 32GB 6000 MHZ (any brand will do)\n4. SSD: Crucial p310 gen4 1TB M.2 NVME\n5. Cooler: Any 360mm AIO cooler\n6. PSU: Anything 850W and modular\n7. Case: Anything that is good enough for this build ( was looking at Antec full towers)\n\nI don't know if this is a good build, especially with the CPU. Here are my questions.\n\n1. Please suggest if I should go with the 7800x3d or the 9800x3d. Are there any gains with the 9800x3d if paired with the 5080?\n2. Is the ZOTAC Nvidia 5080 solid OC a good card? Is there a point in going with more expensive ones?\n3. Is there any point to increasing the RAM to 64GB? Should 32GB be fine?\n4. What's with all these white edition components out there? Are they just for show?\n\nIt would be really helpful if anyone could suggest something. I don't have much expertise and all suggestions would be helpful. Thanks in advance.",

    "title": "Troubleshooting Hell: Fixed 'No Display/Intermittent Power' issue, now have 'Rear Audio Static'. Hardware fault?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm at the end of my rope with a PC problem that has evolved. I fixed the initial \"no boot\" issue, but now I have a new hardware-level problem. I've done a ton of troubleshooting and I'm looking for some expert opinions.\n\n# My Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 3600\n* **Motherboard:** ASRock B450M-HDV R4.0\n* **RAM:** 8GB DDR4 3200MHz\n* **Cooler:** Deepcool AK400\n* **GPU:** GT 1030\n* **PSU:** Corsair VS 450\n\n# The Original Problem:\n\nMy PC was working fine for a long time, then it suddenly started to fail.\n\n1. **Intermittent Power:** Sometimes pressing the power button did nothing. Other times, it would power on.\n2. **No Display:** When it *did* power on (fans spinning, lights on), I would **never** get a display output.\n\n# How I Fixed the \"No Display\" Issue:\n\nI went through the full troubleshooting gauntlet. I...\n\n* Tried a different, known-good GPU.\n* Reseated my RAM multiple times.\n* Checked and re-plugged every single power cable (24-pin, 8-pin CPU, etc.).\n* My motherboard has no debug LEDs.\n* I finally did a **full teardown**. I removed the motherboard, uninstalled the Ryzen 5 3600, cleaned it, re-applied thermal paste, and re-assembled everything.\n\n# The NEW Problem:\n\nThe good news: The PC now boots reliably and I get a display. Windows loads fine.\n\nThe bad news: I have **loud, constant static and no actual sound** coming from the **rear green audio port** (plugged directly into the motherboard I/O).\n\n# Troubleshooting I've ALREADY Done for the Audio:\n\n1. **Tested in Linux:** This is the most important part. I booted into a live Ubuntu USB, and the **exact same static problem happens there.** This confirms it is a **hardware problem**, not a Windows or driver issue.\n2. **Checked BIOS:** I went into the ASRock BIOS and changed `Onboard HD Audio` from `AUTO` to `Enabled`. \n3. **Reinstalled Drivers:** Even though I knew it was hardware, I uninstalled the Realtek audio device in Windows (checking \"Delete the driver software\") and reinstalled. It didn't help.\n4. **Checked Front Panel Audio:** I've plugged in the `HD_AUDIO` front panel cable, but this shouldn't matter since I'm testing from the rear port.\n\n# My Question:\n\nGiven that it's a hardware fault that appeared after a full rebuild, what's the most likely cause?\n\n* Is it possible the onboard audio chip was damaged by the earlier intermittent power failures?\n* Is it more likely I bent one of the I/O shield's metal grounding tabs *into* the green audio port, causing a physical short?\n\nI'm one step away from just buying a USB audio adapter, but I'd love to know if there's anything else I can check.

    "selftext": "This is my first time building a pc myself and wanted an outside opinion on the parts I picked before I start buying them. \n\nI would need the PC to be able to do a few things including: run art programs, video editing/content creation, light programing and some casual gaming like: Minecraft, Stardew Valley, ect. ect.\n\nHere's the parts I've chosen so far:\n[PC part picker list]\n(https://pcpartpicker.com/list/TbrDt3)\n**CPU:** Intel core i5-13400\n**CPU cooler:** cooler master hyper 212 rgb\n**GPU:** MSI GeForce nvidia RTX 3060 12gb  \n**Motherboard:** ASrock B760 Pro RS Wifi \n**Ram:** Silicon Power XPower Zenith gaming 16gb x2  \n**Storage(SSD):** PNY CS2230 1TB M.2-2280 x1 \n**PSU:** BeQuiet! Pure Power 12 M 650w\n**Case:** Vetroo AL800 ATX mid tower\n**Case fans:** NZXT F120 RGB core 120mm x2\n\nSome specific questions I have:\n\n*Is 750w too much? I want enough wiggle room incase I want to upgrade some parts later, but not too much that it\"s a wate of money. It also needs 2 ESP 8pin connectors for the current motherboard.\n\n*Is the motherboard good? I was having trouble trying to choose one that I liked.\n\n*I used few bottleneck calculators and most of them say I have a gpu bottleneck but it's mostly at higher resolutions than my monitor, and I don't plan on getting a new one at the momment. Should I still get a different gpu? If so, which ones would you recomend?\n\nThe Budget is about $1000 USD. I'm planing on getting some of the parts second hand to save some money, if you have any tips on that, please leave them aswell.",

    "selftext": "Since the release of the RTX 5080, there’s been a lots of issues - from ridiculous pricing to overheating and melting reports. I decided to wait for the 5080 Ti, hoping Nvidia would fix those problems, but I’ve come to realize it’s probably never coming. And even if it does, it’ll be overpriced as hell.\n\nSo I started looking for alternatives.  \nRight now, I see three realistic options:\n\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** \\- around €950 in my country. Slightly lower performance, but much better value.\n* **RX 9070 XT** \\-  about €750, even stronger price/performance ratio. The thing is… I’ve been burned by AMD drivers before. My old 6800 XT literally died because of them, and DLSS still beats even the newest FSR in both quality and adoption.\n* **RTX 5080** \\- averages €1340. I'm just afraid of this card. I've heard only bad things about it. And it's cost almost twice as best AMD GPU.\n\nFor reference, here’s my current setup:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS TUF GAMING X570-PLUS (Wi-Fi)\n* **RAM:** 32 GB DDR4 @ 4,396 MHz\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n* **Main monitor:** 1440p HDR\n* **Secondary:** 1440p (YouTube / multitasking)\n* **PSU:** be quiet! Pure Power 12 M 1200 W (yeah, I know, overkill)\n\nMy 3080 Ti is starting to choke on newer titles, and the lack of access to modern upscaling tech is becoming noticeable.  \nIt sucks that so much of GPU performance now relies on software tricks, but here we are.\n\nSo… what would you do in my place?",

That's part of why I went with the ryzen 7600 instead of an intel i5 – read that the i5s are a bit more power hungry/less efficient. Also, went with the 7600 instead of 7500f so I'd have integrated graphics for troubleshooting in case the GPU ever has any issues. \n\nHoping this gets me by for another five to ten years.\n\nI think 64gb of ram is likely overkill, so definitely willing to drop that to 32 if there's consensus on that. Quick notes on why I'm considering it though: I'm a major multi-tasker often with four or five applications open at a time (browser with too many tabs, guitar emulation software, ableton, some random game running in the background, Discord, etc.) and if computers were sentient my tab usage would be a war crime. I'm coming from 16gb ddr4-2133 that maxes out with just the OS + Firefox though, and don't have a sense of how big of a difference 32gb of quality ddr5 would be compared to this.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need some advice on what to do. I built a budget gaming PC during the pandemic, but it's starting to show its age.\n\nSince I'm a big Anno fan, I'm a little concerned about the system requirements for Anno 117 and would like to optimize something. I've already played the beta, but had to play everything at the lowest resolution and the FPS wasn't particularly good (unfortunately, I haven’t measured it).\n\nOtherwise, I mainly play CS2 and PUBG.\n\nMy current components are:\n- AMD Ryzen 5 2600\n- 8GB XFX Radeon RX 570 RS\n- MSI B450 Gaming Plus MAX\n- 650 Watt Seasonic S12III\n\nI don't have a budget, but it should make sense. I don't currently play demanding games, but I would like to keep that option open. Otherwise, it would be important to me that the upgrade lasts for a few years.\n\nWhat do you think, is it worth upgrading individual components (such as a 3060 12GB), or should I generally replace/rebuild more?\n\nAdditional information: I live in Germany and have no problem with used parts, although I feel that the prices for used parts are often much too high.",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI have been using a gaming laptop for a fairly long time and looking to build a pc now. Right now, I am using the Lenovo Legion 5 pro with the Nvidia 3060 (which does the job frankly). But I'm looking to game at 4k with high settings, and some occasional editing stuff (Davinci Resolve). I have been out of the pc build space for some time and I'm thoroughly confused with the entire gamut of options available.\n\nHere is something I came up with:\n1. CPU: AMD RYZEN 7 9800X3D/7800X3D\n2. GPU: ZOTAC NVIDIA 5080 SOLID OC 16GB\n3. RAM: 32GB 6000 MHZ (any brand will do)\n4. SSD: Crucial p310 gen4 1TB M.2 NVME\n5. Cooler: Any 360mm AIO cooler\n6. PSU: Anything 850W and modular\n7. Case: Anything that is good enough for this build ( was looking at Antec full towers)\n\nI don't know if this is a good build, especially with the CPU. Here are my questions.\n\n1. Please suggest if I should go with the 7800x3d or the 9800x3d. Are there any gains with the 9800x3d if paired with the 5080?\n2. Is the ZOTAC Nvidia 5080 solid OC a good card? Is there a point in going with more expensive ones?\n3. Is there any point to increasing the RAM to 64GB? Should 32GB be fine?\n4. What's with all these white edition components out there? Are they just for show?\n\nIt would be really helpful if anyone could suggest something. I don't have much expertise and all suggestions would be helpful. Thanks in advance.",

Started playing stuff 2-3 years late instead.\n\nTurns out it's way better. Games are cheaper, bugs are fixed, I know which ones are actually worth my time. Just finished God of War (2018) and it hit harder than most \"new\" experiences I've chased.\n\nNo pressure to rush through for discourse. Just me and a complete, polished game.\n\nAnyone else embrace being late to everything? It's honestly freeing.",

    "selftext": "2 years ago, I was working at Blizzard on an unannounced survival game. Then Microsoft bought us and cancelled the project. I did some freelance work and started working on a game that I would enjoy, a combination of genres that I really like. \n- Tower Defense\n- Roguelite\n- Deck building\n\nSo I made Deck vs Doom! And it finally just released! It was a fun journey and I feel proud having it up on steam. If you want to check it out, here is the link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2811780/Deck_Vs_Doom/\n\nIt's currently on a launch sale right now! And if you do pick it up, you'll make a solo-dev really happy!",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

If you're in the mood for a great space opera with a satirical twist and RPG elements, you should definitely give this shooter a try.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pizza Fria](https://opencritic.com/outlet/915/pizza-fria)** - [Leandro Felippe de Paiva Gomes](https://opencritic.com/critic/10798/leandro-felippe-de-paiva-gomes) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://pizzafria.ig.com.br/analises/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 manages to captivate with its charismatic cast of characters, a world that truly rewards exploration, and a good variety of approaches and choices that generate real consequences in the player's journey.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Timothy Nunes](https://opencritic.com/critic/846/timothy-nunes) - [9 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-ps5/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 excels on almost all fronts, presenting you with an open RPG that lets you choose how you progress while still keeping you on a clear path. The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie’s Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

You can prove me wrong 😀\n\nGameplay consists of simple first person point-and-click mechanics. Where it stands out is interactivity. Environment is carefully hand-crafted with attention to detail, from the architecture of the buildings all the way down to the flushing sounds in the toilet.\n\nThe estimated length of the game is roughly 2 hours i would say. The length of the game depends on how fast you solve the puzzles. Some of them might be slightly on the more difficult side of the spectrum since they are a little bit unconventional.\n\n**Main features**\n\n* **Atmospheric first-person** mystery with light point-and-click style interactions.  \n* **Highly interactive environments** \\- almost everything reacts: drawers, switches, computers, instruments, sauna, etc.  \n* **Environmental storytelling**: newspapers, phones, and tiny props that hide clues.  \n* **Puzzles** that skew a bit **unconventional** \\- some are simple, a few are “huh… wait” moments by design.  \n\nBuilt to reward **curiosity** and **note-taking** rather than brute forcing.",

    "selftext": "To be more specific, Massive Entertainment put out a social media statement implying that they're encouraging staff to voluntarily leave the company/lay themselves off with benefits/company assistance:\n\n\"As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games. To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

Jeanette and Therese, the haunted house quest, damn it was good.\nThis feeling to be a monster, powerful, free, cover by vice decafance and sensuality..and humour. \n\nSo yeah, I knew VTM: Bloodlines 2 wouldn’t be great but a part of be wish they gat at least the atmosphere, the \" cool\" factor! ...well They dint and it turned out to be a disappointment. I was ready to play something less open-world, more action-driven, without the full open world and multi-gameplay style of the first.\n\nWhen I started the game, I had a little bit of hope... until they showed me the skill sheet and I realized how simple it was. I became... sad.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, it just doesn’t have a soul. It’s boring. The voice acting for every character, including the main one, is dull and lifeless, with no energy or personality. It lacks the sensuality, the vice, the dirtiness that made the first game unforgettable. The game feels too clean, like the studio didn’t want to take any risks. The female Nomad is boring as hell. Fabian the Malkavian is slightly less boring, but still not entertaining. And he’s a freaking Malkavian!\n\nThe controls are stiff, the combat is dull (I chose Tremere, maybe that was a mistake), and the game is full of bugs. The music... well, it’s somewhere? But when it plays, it completely lacks that epic gothic techno vibe from the first game.\n\nThat said, I do like the graphic style. It looks good. There’s something there, something that could make a great game if they knew what to do with it.\n\nI really hope this isn’t the last game of the series. I want a third one, something that lets them finally make a good game. I hope they listen to the community’s feedback and run with it.\n",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features. The Outer Worlds 2 showcases impressive narrative adaptability to player choices, lacking only a bit of technical ambition and polish to rank among the best role-playing games of today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[INVEN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/805/inven)** - [Kyuman Kim](https://opencritic.com/critic/9273/kyuman-kim) - *Korean* - [8.2 / 10](https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=310629)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 showcases Obsidian's RPG mastery through meaningful choices and dynamic character building, though the world lacks the vibrancy of modern open-world games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Just Play it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/936/just-play-it)** - [Aimen TAIB](https://opencritic.com/critic/10987/aimen-taib) - *Arabic* - [7.5 / 10](https://justplayit.info/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 may not be suitable for all players due to its complex narrative, but it’s undoubtedly a fitting choice for those seeking a deep RPG experience that demands thought and analysis. It offers you the freedom to choose a path that aligns with your own direction, both in terms of story and gameplay. However, it still suffers from several issues that need fixing.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Loot Level Chill](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)** - [Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser) - [9 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deceptively smart Looter-shooter RPG with colourful worlds and entertaining characters, and some really satisfying, malleable combat.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MondoXbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/794/mondoxbox)** - [Giuseppe Genga](https://opencritic.com/critic/7638/giuseppe-genga) - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.mondoxbox.com/recensione/3825/the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 improves upon its predecessor in mission design, combat, and meaningful player choice, offering a solid sci-fi RPG experience. However, it unfortunately falters in its narrative, with a lackluster story and unconvincing companions that fail to engage, leaving a technically proficient but less inspired adventure.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MonsterVine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/334/monstervine)** - [Joe Bariso](https://opencritic.com/critic/7475/joe-bariso) - [3.5 / 5](https://monstervine.com/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a serviceable RPG held back from greatness by playing it too safe and small. Too afraid to alienate players and make big swings like the setting deserves.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nexus Hub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus-hub)** - [Andrew Logue](https://opencritic.com/critic/3996/andrew-logue) - [8 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves if it ain’t broke, make it bigger and prettier - a solid sequel that expands upon the first game in meaningful ways, though some fans might experience a bit of déjà vu.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Vincent Ternida](https://opencritic.com/critic/8412/vincent-ternida) - [8 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a title well worth exploring, offering accessible gameplay and thoughtful quality-of-life enhancements that cater to both newcomers and returning fans. While it doesn’t radically reinvent the formula, it delivers a satisfying action RPG experience that scratches the adventure itch and rewards players who engage with its missions in full.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PPE.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/642/ppe-pl)** - [Patryk Dzięglewicz](https://opencritic.com/critic/8235/patryk-dzi-glewicz) - *Polish* - [8 / 10](https://www.ppe.pl/recenzje/387599/the-outer-worlds-2-recenzja-gry-chciwosc-kontra-totalitaryzm.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 may not revolutionize what we saw in the first installment, but it significantly improves on familiar elements. If you're in the mood for a great space opera with a satirical twist and RPG elements, you should definitely give this shooter a try.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pizza Fria](https://opencritic.com/outlet/915/pizza-fria)** - [Leandro Felippe de Paiva Gomes](https://opencritic.com/critic/10798/leandro-felippe-de-paiva-gomes) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://pizzafria.ig.com.br/analises/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 manages to captivate with its charismatic cast of characters, a world that truly rewards exploration, and a good variety of approaches and choices that generate real consequences in the player's journey.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Timothy Nunes](https://opencritic.com/critic/846/timothy-nunes) - [9 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-ps5/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 excels on almost all fronts, presenting you with an open RPG that lets you choose how you progress while still keeping you on a clear path. The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie’s Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

    "selftext": "Hey all, we're a small team of 4 brothers and are excited to announce our new game, Noblemen: 1941! \n\nIn a nutshell its an alternate reality ww2 3rd person shooter, with several strategic layers. In battle, you can deploy units alongside you (and give them orders via a tactical pause, if you want), and on a macro level you will seamlessly manage resources, supply lines, capture and defend locations, build structures, and more on a constantly evolving (in real time) strategic map. The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

    "selftext": "Little preface: I wrote this post over a few attempts at troubleshooting. Sorry if it's a bit messy because of that.\n\nFirst off, it seems like my computer just... doesn't record what I do? If I delete or download a file and then restart my pc, the file I deleted will reappear, and the stuff I downloaded will disappear. I'll have a browser tab open, close the window, do other stuff for an hour, and then restart my pc and reopen Firefox, and the initial tab will reopen as though it was open when I closed Firefox. If I move a file to another location, or move a shortcut around on my desktop, it just goes back to wherever it originally was. Past all of that, my pc has just generally been a bit slower. It takes a good deal longer to open stuff, longer to reboot, etc. Additionally, things have been a lot more prone to crashing / not responding.\n\nI booted my pc in safe mode, and while in safe mode, it seems like I'm able to delete and modify things like normal, so whatever issue my pc is having, seems to be solved by booting in safe mode for whatever reason. In safe mode, I ran DISM Restorehealth and SFC, and it said that it found and restored some corrupted files, which I think seemed to fix things for a little bit maybe? It did end up just going back to normal though. I tried running DISM and SFC again, and I don't think it did anything.\n\nI tried booting in safe mode again, and for some reason, now it's not working. I think it might be because of the windows update that came out today? Every time I boot my computer, it downloads the update again, which I think in turn makes it reset again such that it boots in normal mode. In any case, I can't seem to get my pc to boot in safe mode. I tried running DISM and SFC in normal mode, and neither work. I went into msconfig to try and force my pc to start in safe mode, and it was stuck on the restarting screen for like 10 minutes before I just hard restarted it. It did end up booting in safe mode though. I tried running windows defender anti-virus because I really couldn't think of anything else. Running the antivirus caused my pc to crash and give the error message \"The application or operating system couldn't be loaded because a required file is missing or contains errors. File: Windows/system32/winload.exe. Error code 0x00000e\"\n\nThis is a new computer, and it was working perfectly fine just a day ago. Does anybody have any clue what the hell's going on? Is it a virus, or some weird issue with my driver? I have the ability to open my BIOs prior to startup, which I think means that I can delete everything on my drive and fresh install Windows off a usb? Do I just have to completely factory reset my pc? Could it be some weird hardware issue? Any help would be deeply appreciated. I'm not very familiar with computers, and don't really know how I should possibly go about this random-ass issue.",

    "title": "Upgraded my existing build with 9070 XT. No RGB build.",
    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI decided to move away from liquid cooling entirely and went back to basics. Liquid cooling is great but it demands labor, maintenance and, transportation becomes risky and labor intensive. As I have to relocate and move between cities frequently I couldn't handle the extra work.\n\nI upgraded the CPU to 5600X as I got a very good deal on it and purchased a 9070XT. My goal was to be able to play games smoothly at 4K on a newly purchased 4K monitor. I think this build will serve me for a very long time and it's future-proof with FSR4.\n\nI purchased a CPU air cooler as well. CPU cooler is double tower and may seem to be an overkill for a 5600X but I got it at a very good price and it's future-proof with AM5 as well. I chose air cooler over an AIO because these last forever. No risk of leakage or replacement requirement when pump stops working. Also, I could set orientation of one top corner fan as exhaust and one as intake. I learnt this airflow strategy from a Noctua article. I think air coolers are great, as they require little to no maintenance apart from dust cleaning and they last almost forever.\n\nI upgraded the PSU as modern power supplies offer better transient response times and hold-up time. With my older PSU my PC sometimes used to get reset after a power outage as my inverter had a bit higher switch-over time.\n\nI upgraded the motherboard to AsRock B450 PRO4 R2.0. This was only motherboard that I could buy in B450 series and also being old it was available on a very good price. My older motherboard LAN card had become faulty and 1 CPU capacitor was burnt.\n\nAlso upgraded the HDDs to SSDs. That 4-bay 2.5\" SSD mount is 3D printed. And, upgraded the NVMe drive as it had stopped working. Although, PCle 3.0x4 SSDs don't require any additional heatsink but I got one installed anyway. It looks great. This is how storage is planned/utilized for now:\n\n2.5\" 512GB: Windows\n\n2.5\" 512GB: Devuan GNU+Linux\n\n2.5\" 2TB: Windows Storage\n\n2.5\" 2TB: Devuan Storage\n\nNVMe 1TB: I/O intensive games or software.\n\nAll fans (4) on the front side are intake. Top corner fans (2) are exhaust. Installed third additional (3) fan on CPU cooler after ordering mounting clips from Amazon. These clips are not readily available so I used Amazon to import them for a bit higher price. I have added custom cut mesh for every intake fan and gaps.\n\nCase USB panel had gone faulty so I have not attached it.\n\nI have played games for a few hours and ran some benchmarks. Everything looks great. I am calling this build \"The AirWolf\".\n\nIn case anyone wanting to checkout the parts list. Here's a [pcpartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/RsKp99) link.\n\nThank you for checking out my build. Looking forward to the comments and learn more from feedback.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I am reaching out with a difficult but urgent request for assistance.\nI am a 22-year-old recent graduate and a long-time PC enthusiast. I spent time working as a delivery person and finally purchased my first decent laptop—an Acer Aspire 7 (16GB RAM, 500GB storage, 3050 4GB GPU)—in 2023.\nJust a few days ago, a sudden power fluctuation caused the motherboard to burn out and cpu aint working.\nNeed-\nThe total cost for the repair is estimated at 20k Indian rupees($200). I have managed to secure $50 myself, and my parents, despite their own financial strain, can contribute a little more. This means I am still short of the full amount needed to get the laptop fixed.\nMy need is immediate because of a deadline-\n •Job Interview: I recently cleared several exams and have a critical job interview scheduled for mid-December. This is a major opportunity to secure a job that will help me support myself and my family.\n •Locked Data: All of my essential study notes, preparatory materials, and data for this interview are locked on the dead laptop's drive. I have no other computer to prepare with.\nI feel guilt even writing this appeal, but this is my last recourse to ensure I can properly prepare for exam 🥲\n\nI am requesting any help you can offer to bridge the repair cost gap.\nI promise to pay back any contribution once I secure the job. I am willing to be completely transparent. I can either\n •Hop on a call to show the damaged laptop.\n •Send the official repair quotation and any other proof required.\nIf you are able to help, please contact me. I understand any skepticism about online appeals, but I am truly in a desperate situation with my future on the line.\nIdk who's sees this but thank you for reading till here have a good day guys ♥️.\n",

    "selftext": "So three years ago my older cousin helped me build my pc. The problem arose when the motherboard was floating after the GPU was installed. I thought this was a design flaw. My cousin eventually implemented a fix that got my PC to work.\n\nYesterday, I opened my PC to add a 2TB ssd, as I’m going to install Linux. Then my PC wouldn’t boot. Okay, weird. So I tried it with just the old hdd. Not displaying. I spent hours trying to get my PC to just display again. After reinserting my GPU and Ram over and over again, my motherboard loosens. So I decide to breadboard it because I want it to display. And it works.\n\nSo I rebuild my PC and I learn that standoffs support the motherboard and is where the screws go. I then look at my case and see one singular standoff without a screw. This was my cousins solution to keep the motherboard in place. The standoff went in a spot where  there was no screw hole on the motherboard. He just put a stand-off in a random spot.\n\nRight now I’m putting the rest of the PC back together. Does anyone else have embarrassing PC building stories?",

He has a relatively old account. And we met at the police station. My hotspot wasn’t working to set it up so he could test it, I agreed to come tomorrow he handed me the money earlier and it looked real, He had come in a new white tesla too and seemed like a genuine guy. He wasn’t covering his face or anything and we talked about uni. We met up at the police station under the cameras outside the entrance and he asked to come inside the station but like mentioned it was closed. Today in the same place i setup the switch and he said he had to go soon since i was already 10 mins late myself and it was no big deal he takes the ally, opens up the case and hands me the same money again in the same little baggy. When i started opening it he started speed walking towards his car parked in-front of mine, I would never come to buy/sell on facebook without carrying and i hadn’t this time but i got to his window and he launched the tesla out of there. I came i a tesla too and the dashcam footage caught the whole interaction on camera and i went to check his profile being blocked. 15 minutes after i come home he has the audacity to message me saying how it looks legit and if he has any issues he will call me. this might be one of the dumbest criminals coming infront of a police station with his own car. The registration number shows it’s not stolen either.",

I do want to play both games, but they're also both quite frustrating & disappointing.\n\nVampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2 had been on my wishlist since 2019. I loved the original Bloodlines & played through it again last month. Bloodlines 2 has been in development hell for years & received very 7/10 reviews. I decided to meet it on its own terms & play anyway & yeah, it's kinda bad & a bit buggy, but there are still things I like.\n\nFootball Manager 26 has also been in development hell of sorts. FM25 was cancelled due to how bad the UI was, by the studio head's own admission. FM26 has just gone into beta 'Advanced Access' ahead of full launch in a couple of weeks. It's *very* buggy. It's also pretty bad in a lot of ways. This game is in the Unity engine & carries over most of the functionality from previous versions, but presents it very differently along with some much-improved graphics in the actual matches. The new UI takes some getting used to for veteran players, but a lot of it is just objectively bad. There is still enjoyment to be had though, the new tactical system makes things feel new again & seeing it all carried out in the new match engine is great.\n\nWhat do you do when 2 games you want to play launch at once?",

    "title": "The multi-billion dollar, 15-hour AWS outage that brought the internet to its knees last week was apparently caused by a single software bug",
    "selftext": "The culprit was a software bug in DynamoDB, AWS' DNS management system. DNS or \"Domain Name System\" is often analogized as the phone book of the internet, translating domain names preferred by human users into the IP addresses required by automated systems. On the modern internet, many services, such as cloud computing or streaming, need to be able to assign the same domain to multiple IP addresses in a network, allowing efficient use of geographically distributed servers.\n\n  \nDNS Enactor, a component of DynamoDB responsible for updating these tables, \"experienced unusually high delays needing to retry its update on several of the DNS endpoints.\" While Enactor played catch-up, DynamoDB continued generating new plans for it to follow, which another, on-time DNS Enactor helpfully tried to implement.\n\n  \nThe fresh DNS configuration that resulted was overwritten by a significantly outdated one when the delayed Enactor finally caught up, bypassing a safeguard meant to prevent just such an error which was also experiencing delays. The second, on-time Enactor then deleted the outdated plan altogether, detecting that it was stale. This state of affairs resulted in knock on effects across AWS, requiring engineers to manually diagnose the problem and resolve it.",

    "title": "Upgraded my existing build with 9070 XT. No RGB build.",
    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI decided to move away from liquid cooling entirely and went back to basics. Liquid cooling is great but it demands labor, maintenance and, transportation becomes risky and labor intensive. As I have to relocate and move between cities frequently I couldn't handle the extra work.\n\nI upgraded the CPU to 5600X as I got a very good deal on it and purchased a 9070XT. My goal was to be able to play games smoothly at 4K on a newly purchased 4K monitor. I think this build will serve me for a very long time and it's future-proof with FSR4.\n\nI purchased a CPU air cooler as well. CPU cooler is double tower and may seem to be an overkill for a 5600X but I got it at a very good price and it's future-proof with AM5 as well. I chose air cooler over an AIO because these last forever. No risk of leakage or replacement requirement when pump stops working. Also, I could set orientation of one top corner fan as exhaust and one as intake. I learnt this airflow strategy from a Noctua article. I think air coolers are great, as they require little to no maintenance apart from dust cleaning and they last almost forever.\n\nI upgraded the PSU as modern power supplies offer better transient response times and hold-up time. With my older PSU my PC sometimes used to get reset after a power outage as my inverter had a bit higher switch-over time.\n\nI upgraded the motherboard to AsRock B450 PRO4 R2.0. This was only motherboard that I could buy in B450 series and also being old it was available on a very good price. My older motherboard LAN card had become faulty and 1 CPU capacitor was burnt.\n\nAlso upgraded the HDDs to SSDs. That 4-bay 2.5\" SSD mount is 3D printed. And, upgraded the NVMe drive as it had stopped working. Although, PCle 3.0x4 SSDs don't require any additional heatsink but I got one installed anyway. It looks great. This is how storage is planned/utilized for now:\n\n2.5\" 512GB: Windows\n\n2.5\" 512GB: Devuan GNU+Linux\n\n2.5\" 2TB: Windows Storage\n\n2.5\" 2TB: Devuan Storage\n\nNVMe 1TB: I/O intensive games or software.\n\nAll fans (4) on the front side are intake. Top corner fans (2) are exhaust. Installed third additional (3) fan on CPU cooler after ordering mounting clips from Amazon. These clips are not readily available so I used Amazon to import them for a bit higher price. I have added custom cut mesh for every intake fan and gaps.\n\nCase USB panel had gone faulty so I have not attached it.\n\nI have played games for a few hours and ran some benchmarks. Everything looks great. I am calling this build \"The AirWolf\".\n\nIn case anyone wanting to checkout the parts list. Here's a [pcpartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/RsKp99) link.\n\nThank you for checking out my build. Looking forward to the comments and learn more from feedback.",

    "subreddit": "pcmasterrace",
    "title": "The state of Linux for gaming and general use from a Linux veteran's perspective",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nEvery day I see some really weird takes about Linux being upvoted to high heavens that simply are half-truths at best, outright false at worst which makes me believe there's a lack of knowledge about what Linux is and how a modern Linux environment operates, so I'm writing this to give you some insight about the actual state of things.\n\nFirst and foremost, basic Linux terminology. Linux is a group of operative systems (software that communicates with your hardware such as Windows and macOS) mainly spread into three big categories, with many smaller (and bigger in the case of Ubuntu being based on Debian) ones that are edits of the big ones. these are:\n\nDebian (with Ubuntu being a famous derivative), Arch and Fedora. there are ***many*** other options out there and Linux enthusiasts will argue hard for why their weapon of choice is really the best one, but that's where we stand in general.\n\n# Why not Linux?\n\nLet's just get this out of the way at first - Linux is ***not*** flawless or in ***any way shape or form*** or better than Windows If you like the way Microsoft does things with Windows and want the broadest software compatibility (read: everything works) on the market. Using Linux is ***mainly*** a painless experience, but only if you use Linux in suppported use cases. Most of the pain about Linux I read are people that break their own systems doing things they don't understand nor do they know how to recover even though Linux has a very handy snapshot feature that allows you to recover to a previous state just like Windows.\n\nThere's also a current major pain point in the Linux world regarding a transition from X11 to Wayland as a display server protocol (the way you show stuff on your screen, simplified).\n\n**So how does Linux run all of this Windows software if devs aren't making Linux versions?**\n\nOn Linux you quite simply (but extremely technically complex in execution) pretend you're Windows by wrapping software calls into software such as Proton that in turn in based on Wine, or you use Wine directly. The program thinks it is running on Windows and is thus happy to do its thing, and as a result it just works.\n\nThe completely unsupported use cases are primarily the inability to run software with kernel level anticheat (League of Legends, Valorant, Fortnite, Battlefield 6, Call of Duty, Apex Legends) but there's also issues with fringe hardware such as some racing wheels as an example and hardware software such as iCUE that relies on third party implementations instead.\n\nFringe software does ***not*** include most brand name printers on the market, this problem has been solved and continues to be solved by simply installing the printer driver just like you would on Windows if that driver doesn't come prebundled. The main issue here is that Windows often installs a lot of stuff \"in case you need it\", Linux is sometimes doing the same, but more often than not expects you to install things you need, rather than assume you need 90 different printer drivers even though you don't own a printer.\n\nNow if that's not the biggest of issues for you, or you're willing to dual boot (run Linux and Windows on the same machine) whenever that two week long CoD binge strikes you, or finally just want to know more about Linux read on.\n\n# I thought Linux was all terminal to do anything?\n\nOftentimes in this sub I see people going \"well to get anything done you have to enter weird commands\", and while that is true for some enthusiast linux dists (such as arch) Linux is a well polished product of many decades and have simple easy to use UI:s that are simple enough for your granny to use - really! And if you do run into very peculiar problems (happens to the best of us) well, yeah the terminal is the main weapon of choice, but let us not pretend like modifying the registry on Windows with regedit is a simple easy to understand process either.\n\n**So if Linux isn't all terminal, what does it look like?**\n\nOne of the strengths of Linux is that you really get to choose how Linux looks like, but there's a couple of major default looks to Linux: [Cinnamon](https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/cinnamon.png), [GNOME](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cAFmNr18Yxc/maxresdefault.jpg) and [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.22.0/plasma.png) but also stuff like XFCE, LXTq... list is long.\n\nThere's also major support for extremely custom crazy looking desktops like you find over in r/unixporn  such as [1](https://preview.redd.it/rectangle-i-really-really-like-e-ink-v0-9bbh1hx9xnke1.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=51a7140cfe6b18e16938beafc25fffbcc77906b1), [2](https://preview.redd.it/herbstluftwm-my-functional-sleek-elegant-stylish-nice-v0-32a0pm56bekf1.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d8bcad6909fdedda0df3af970abb9e489c01240d) and [3](https://preview.redd.it/hyprland-second-linux-rice-v0-6xky6m2kaymf1.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e1aedc4c101a2893759369b43de6f61aea2a7f70). All these examples rely on keyboard-first workflows, so if you're not a person that presses Windows + E to open Explorer, do not fret - there's plenty of things for people that prefer clicking too.\n\n**OK so it kinda looks like Windows, but how do I download software if I can't run exe installers I find on the web?!**\n\nThe main way to download software on Linux is actually through application repositories or as you might know them app stores. That's right, the thing that you use on your phone is how you (primarily) download software on Linux.\n\n# But installing Linux is super hard, right? That has to be all terminal?\n\nWhile some dists pride themselves in doing almost completely manual installations (looking at you Arch) as a rite of passage most dists have simple to use installers (Arch derivative CachyOS does, as an example) complete with nice banner graphics and a step by step process where you enter your wifi password and then you're simply done. If you've never installed a OS before such as the OS came preinstalled on your computer or someone did it for you - an installer [looks a bit like this.](https://ubuntucommunity.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/2X/2/29ec0f5c3d8c5b51f7b7440c4e2a95cc9f4a0118.png)\n\n# Ok so... why Linux?\n\n1. Many linux dists use vastly less resources than Windows because they don't preinstall things you don't necessarily need - if you need it you install it. Windows assumes you might need things, and installs it before hand just in case. This leads to a scenario where say a fresh Arch install can be using around 400 MB or less of RAM, whereas Windows typically clocks in at 3 GB right out of the box. On top of that as there's not a whole lot of software running once again just in case, Arch is snappier - this is subjective, you don't necessarily need snappy once you've launched a game and you're playing it and you don't necessarily need 2 GB of extra RAM either.\n\n2. If you're a person that greatly enjoys clicking on things and just want things to run, I really don't recommend Linux. Windows is the reigning champion in the \"click shortcut, run game\" sphere.\n\nBut if you're opposed to the way Microsoft does business (such as forcing AI and telemetrics on you) now is a good time to get your toes wet and seeing what's over the proverbial hedge.\n\n3. You want to be able to customise your computer experience in a way that suits you (once again, r/unixporn) with virtually unlimited freedom to do amazing (and stupid) things.\n\nAll in all, I hope I have helped to dispel some of the common misconceptions about Linux being a \"computer nerd\"-only affair and showing you that unless you go crazy with it, it is really just like using Windows but with a slightly different look (and a working app store).",

    "selftext": "The culprit was a software bug in DynamoDB, AWS' DNS management system. DNS or \"Domain Name System\" is often analogized as the phone book of the internet, translating domain names preferred by human users into the IP addresses required by automated systems. On the modern internet, many services, such as cloud computing or streaming, need to be able to assign the same domain to multiple IP addresses in a network, allowing efficient use of geographically distributed servers.\n\n  \nDNS Enactor, a component of DynamoDB responsible for updating these tables, \"experienced unusually high delays needing to retry its update on several of the DNS endpoints.\" While Enactor played catch-up, DynamoDB continued generating new plans for it to follow, which another, on-time DNS Enactor helpfully tried to implement.\n\n  \nThe fresh DNS configuration that resulted was overwritten by a significantly outdated one when the delayed Enactor finally caught up, bypassing a safeguard meant to prevent just such an error which was also experiencing delays. The second, on-time Enactor then deleted the outdated plan altogether, detecting that it was stale. This state of affairs resulted in knock on effects across AWS, requiring engineers to manually diagnose the problem and resolve it.",

I've made some upgrades based on suggestions + you can all see the full picture of my space I've been talking about (ie where the podcaster is now + mics etc and other side of the wall)\n\n**Check pictures here:** [**WIDE VIEW**](https://freeimage.host/i/pxl-20251025-011046826mp.Kr7j1zg) **|** [**CLOSE VIEW**](https://freeimage.host/i/pxl-20251025-011325535mp.Kr7kK9p)\n\n1. Added riser under monitor\n2. Added keybo/mouse pad (my old one, ordered new one to test)\n3. Added a power shelf under the table on the right\n4. FIXED the monitor tilt, more cable management, tucked computer away behind bar\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\n1. Waiting on new shelf and plants.\n2. Ordered a pegboard as well for charging station\n3. New larger grey scale mouse pad\n4. Headphones modern stand coming in Monday\n\nThank you all for the recommendations and trolling :P was fun!  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Original Post  \nFinally got around revamping my work station.\n\n* Used the [74\" IKEA Kitchen KIRBY Walnut Veneer Table Top](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/karlby-countertop-for-kitchen-island-walnut-veneer-30297641/#content)\n* Got a welder to custom build legs for me\n* Bought square leg risers to add some height + have padding on the bottom of the feet.\n* Added LED lights from Temu\n* Cable management under the monitor area via Amazon\n* Monitor arm from Amazon as well\n* Yamaha HS7 Monitor + Amazon Stands (I wish the stands were shorter but the smaller ones couldn't handle the weight)\n\nMy computer is tucked in the back under, it doesnt stick out...just an early picture ( I built without lights for the first time thinking I wouldn't care lol, wish I got a sick case, but oh well)\n\nWaiting for blackfriday to get a new chair as the current one is too old.\n\nI wanted to add shelving so I bought one but not sure where to add it lol. The left of the table is a window in the basement that throws off the whole look. I will upload an updated picture but thought I would post this to get some feedback in the meantime!",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the ***Logitech G915 TKL*** and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the *G515* with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the ***Keychron K1 Max*** with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using [launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/) but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use [usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

Big win for us all!\n\nI'm a big fan of marbley sounds and the Hi75 is the perfect model for this. Even stock, this thing sounded great.\nI tried HMX Canglan switches on this board, which sounded great but had a more muted and thocky sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the MMD Princesses which had a slightly higher-pitched sound, which I think really helps with the marbley sound as opposed to a more deep and flat sound. I was inspired by sound tests like [this one with MMD Princesses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2iPPrgfkIo) and [this one with Epomaker Jade Blossoms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9EoDIbE9OU) which sound basically perfect to me. The former is more like what my build sounds like IRL so I'm over the moon with the sound, but I still have Jade Blossoms on the way to see what they sound like as well.\n\nI'm also pleasantly surprised by these Osume keycaps. Not only do I like the non-standard legends and gradient colors from top to bottom, the packaging itself was very thoughtful (all rows separated in different trays, and individual places in the trays labeled, as opposed to all keycaps in one enormous tray with no labeling to help). And of course as a Taiwanese guy, I loved these novelties and had to spring for those as well. :)\n\nOverall this is the most perfect build I've ever made and I'm so happy with what the market looks like in 2025.",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Found bigger silicone bumpons that dont sink into deskpads completely, fixing “thudding”. input parts number 107091 into [Here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/), order a reasonable amount and should deliver it to you for free\n\n\nNowadays I’ve been noticing that some keyboards like the Frog Mini and some if the newer Neo boards having issues with how it sounds. This is mostly due to those keyboards having pretty short feet leading to the bottom of the keyboard to touch your deskpad as it compresses due to the weight of the keyboard which causes it to “thud”. \n\nI’ve had issues with this in the past since I use a XSoft mousepad from LethalGamingGear. When i put my keyboard on my mousepad it at first sounds fine, but as the keyboard starts to sink down due to its weight, i start to hear vibrations and “thudding” from the desk.\n\nWhile building a drawer from ikea, i noticed that it came with some silicone bumpons to reduce the noise from the contact of the wood. And now compared to the normal hemisphere silicone bumpons that keyboards usually come with, these are a bit bigger. So I thought to try them on a keyboard that is thudding, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, tall enough so that the bottom does not touch my mousepad. I did some searching to see where i can find more of these and lo and behold, ikea actually gives them for free. Simply go to the [IKEA spare parts](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/) website and input part number 107091 and it should show up. Each one comes in a pack of 2 so as long as you order a reasonable amount, they should give them to you for free delivered straight to you.\n\nEDIT: Size for comparison. Smaller original feet are from a JJW Moment https://imgur.com/a/T48CUmH",

It has the option to be either a single-handed keyboard or a normal macropad, I specifically use my copy of the board for gaming. It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB. That said, this is the [PCB Edition](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-pcb-kit) which is available on my shop if people are interested, in addition to the keycaps and 3D printed case. You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

All keys are working, only one caveat: the upper left LED is not blinking, but I am not a LED guy and its switched off any way (been using Das Keyboard Ultimate with unlabeled keys for years). Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

All are connected to my PC at the same time (don’t ask) and I just grab one depending on what I’m doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn’t want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I’m done!! 😊\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

This is my first ever experience with SA profile, which I was somewhat worried about but turned out to be really compatible with my hands and typing habits. I’m an 80s baby so the thick typewriter style of SA felt oddly familiar as I definitely played with vintage typewriters and word processors. \n\nBoard is a Massdrop CTRL V1 with HMX Gulf switches. ",

    "selftext": "\n\nA flat typing surface is not very comfortable. Most keyboards solve this problem by using profiled keycaps that form the general shape of a curve. However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws:  \n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

    "selftext": "My first mechanical keyboard was an aluminum NK65 into which I popped Zilents, but it soon became a closet board (and then I left it at my childhood home for when I visit the ‘rents and work from here). Since I’ve bought a couple ai03 boards, a Neo Ergo, a Rama U-80B, a couple Jacky Hippos, and the Classic TKL. The latter most really shocked me with how good it felt and sounded at the price point. I also stocked up on Gateron Oil Kings because of all the praise and was really shocked at how great they feel out of the box without added lube.\n\nAnyways, this week I’ve been back home and I’m miserable typing on the NK65. Everything feels and sounds bad. Maybe it’s because I’m a linear man now, and obviously I’m typing on better quality boards at home, but it’s also revelatory to me just how much progress has been made, on switch quality, on stabilizers, on affordable boards. I’m probably going to buy another Classic TKL to leave here and retire/ewaste my old NK alu boards (I have the 80% one also).\n\nCurious if others have found themselves having to type on their first boards from years back and what that experience was like. It has been very very hard for me to revert.",

Overall feels expensive.\n\nBuild quality 10/10 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mpl47f4fowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae90f1ab48f6aab4d5b4eadaf9bd55c81359175d\n\nThe keyboard looks pretty darn well first look, giving off that \"cute aesthetic\" vibe to it (IMHO), I was a bit disappointed because my whole setup is dark/black and the keyboard is standing out between all the dark parts of my PC. I was hoping for the black edition but was out of stock so it's understandable.\n\nI been using 60% and 75% keyboards for 3 years now and overall this big keyboard felt a bit weird at first but then became second nature after 1 or 2 hours. Not to mention it feels smooth to type (using it to type this post RN lol) and it's not that loud, has that \"THOCK\" sound that some are never endlessly looking for.\n\nThe RGB feels okay, wish it was more \"shine through\" (this could be fixed with some shine through keycaps) and it feels okay, have not set it up that much but overall I like it, not intrusive like others.\n\nLooks and feel: 9.5/10\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn8a2p8vfowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c0d3fe5999a988e455883a0f382b130c05a124\n\n  \nThis keyboard has a TON of features, starting with the little screen \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wflohgblowf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4432d2d43d32bcbeff9208a1c4ca89358224d92d\n\nFully customizable and guess what? You don't need an additional driver/software on your PC for yet another keyboard, this one can be used via browser (I think only on Google Chrome) but that's a FANTASTIC advantage, you can use it on Linux and Mac without sacrificing the software or customization of the keys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yps8hhyklowf1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fbd0e74884beee989f1b7b101b883bf279171b9\n\nKudos to Chiikey for this, this is a fantastic feature and something to praise, also it was incredibly easy to just post a gif to the little screen instead of having to cut the gif into multiple images and upload them all like other keyboards\n\nSoftware/Drivers 11/10\n\nAs for the unboxing process it was pretty standard and actually a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nFor starters you do not get any fancy tools to remove the keycaps or the mechanical switches itself, still no clear indication if it's hot swappable 3 or 5 pins (still yet to tear it down, wanted to test it out of the box with no modifications or me removing parts of it) it IS hot swappable but there's no really a lot of transparency of how many pins or what switches are supported.\n\nYou don't get any additional switches unlike other keyboards (some only bring 3 but at least they bring them unlike this one) there's the tab for the compartment where you can store things and also you get some screws, some plastic... tabs? and a little black thing that I am yet to recognize at the time of writing.\n\nAnd of course, you get a USB cable to charge or connect your keyboard, type C so no worries there.\n\nThe USB dongle is inside the keyboard on the bottom part hidden in a tiny\n\nThe packaging was impeccable, very beautiful box and the keyboard was very well wrapped and protected, no dents or scratches and it wasn't all over the place, all neatly packaged in a big rectangular box.\n\nUnboxing and contents: 5/10 \n\nAs mentioned before the switches on this keyboard make a very satisfying \"THOCK\" \"THOCK\" sound, it's not clear if this is lubed but it really feels good, really really good, not that loud too just \"right\"\n\nIt doesn't strain my hands as far as I tested it (around 5 or 6 hours in total, more than enough for someone who works at an office and is constantly typing non stop, even now typing this review lol)\n\nMy only complaint is that no matter what I did, the knob click behaviour never changed when I changed it in the software, it always defaults to \"mute\" instead of \"pause\" or play.\n\nTyping experience 8.5/10\n\nTotal score: 10 + 9.5 + 11 + 5 + 8.5 / 5 = 8.8/10 \n\nPersonal score being honest would be more of a 9/10, it's a pretty darn good keyboard and worth every penny, my only grip is the lack of switches or tools to customize the keyboard to your heart's content and the color, really wish it could have been the dark colored version but that's something I will learn to live with.\n\nCheers!",

[As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the ***Logitech G915 TKL*** and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the *G515* with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the ***Keychron K1 Max*** with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using [launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/) but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use [usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "selftext": "About a year or two ago, I released the [ScottoFrog (Handwired Edition)](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/macropads/scottofrog-handwired-macropad) which is a completely free-to-build 3D printed macropad based on the [Frogpad](http://frogpad.com). It has the option to be either a single-handed keyboard or a normal macropad, I specifically use my copy of the board for gaming. It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB. That said, this is the [PCB Edition](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-pcb-kit) which is available on my shop if people are interested, in addition to the keycaps and 3D printed case. You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

Big win for us all!\n\nI'm a big fan of marbley sounds and the Hi75 is the perfect model for this. Even stock, this thing sounded great.\nI tried HMX Canglan switches on this board, which sounded great but had a more muted and thocky sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the MMD Princesses which had a slightly higher-pitched sound, which I think really helps with the marbley sound as opposed to a more deep and flat sound. I was inspired by sound tests like [this one with MMD Princesses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2iPPrgfkIo) and [this one with Epomaker Jade Blossoms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9EoDIbE9OU) which sound basically perfect to me. The former is more like what my build sounds like IRL so I'm over the moon with the sound, but I still have Jade Blossoms on the way to see what they sound like as well.\n\nI'm also pleasantly surprised by these Osume keycaps. Not only do I like the non-standard legends and gradient colors from top to bottom, the packaging itself was very thoughtful (all rows separated in different trays, and individual places in the trays labeled, as opposed to all keycaps in one enormous tray with no labeling to help). And of course as a Taiwanese guy, I loved these novelties and had to spring for those as well. :)\n\nOverall this is the most perfect build I've ever made and I'm so happy with what the market looks like in 2025.",

All keys are working, only one caveat: the upper left LED is not blinking, but I am not a LED guy and its switched off any way (been using Das Keyboard Ultimate with unlabeled keys for years). Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the ***Logitech G915 TKL*** and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the *G515* with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the ***Keychron K1 Max*** with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using [launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/) but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use [usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: just ranting over AOC being the type of guy who leaves you on delivered while they're online\n\nI bought a monitor from them during black Friday last year when I saw a nice OLED deal for 400$ (not including tax) for a PC build I was planning. Color saturation was a bit weird (especially for an OLED) no matter how much I tweak with the settings, but otherwise it served me well.\n\nAround August, 9 months after purchase, I noticed some weird glitching at the bottom of the panel. I thought it might be a problem with my PC, thought after days of troubleshooting, I realized the problem was with the monitor since using a different cable with a my old laptop still didn't solve the issue. I contacted AOC about this since then thought various methods, from their official website to their email but with no response, and the issue is only getting worse, because on late August black horizontal bars are all over the monitor and on September 16 the monitor started to black screens every 15 seconds or so for around 4 seconds.\n\nThe warranty I got is 4 years of no dead pixels, 4 years of advanced replacement and a year of free replacement for accidental damage, and with my luck so far I'm sure their gonna find something to get them to have it go under user-damage, and I only got 4 weeks until that expires.\n\n\nWhat hurts is that I spent a lot to ship this monitor to my region and that I sacrificed some of the GPU budget to squeeze in that OLED panel so I guess the moral of the story is don't ship monitors overseas and prioritize performance over display for gaming if you can't stretch your budget\n\n",

EVERY time it does it.) this means that either the panel isnt 1440p but bigger, or the displayed image is smaller than 1440p.\n\nI paid for a monitor with a resolution of 2560x1440 and I would like to think that I get to use all of those pixles at the same time without having to \"bunch\" my image by even a fraction of a percent and have 2 rows of pixels merging/overriding each other.\n\nIt doesn't sit well with me to know I'm at no point ever using the entire panel at once which has the specified resolution. I surely cannot be alone with that. I'd like to turn pixel shift off.\n\nIs there a firmware version out there that lets me turn it off? Is my assumption about the panel wrong? Do you have thoughts or opinions to share about burn-in risks without pixel shift? Please let me know.\n\n  \nEdit: Downvoted to zero for a simple question with zero fluff or bullshit. Now nobody that might have valuable input can see this post. Thanks guys",

If I increased the refresh rate beyond 60 all the colors would become sharper, which isn't inherently bad, but in some games the colors would become so dark it was almost unplayable, and I wasn't able to find any setting on the monitor itself to change the color mode.

    "selftext": "Hey ya’ll, I finally got around to making this review/comparison. I’m currently running side by side mounted on their stands. Please note I have no professional equipment and this is all just side by side comparison. I did come from a nice IPS display that was an omen 27qs and I have an LG CX oled TV for comparison. Used my iphone 16 PM as well lol. \n\n[Proof!](https://preview.redd.it/jqjmjoq0ndxf1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b3b88da3874fcf3f64fdc764c7546dbe17adb33)\n\n**GPU: RX 9070xt**  \n**OS:** Linux (CachyOS) and Windows 11 Pro 24H2.  \n**Connection:** OEM Included DP cables.  \n**Games Tested**: Stalker 2, Arc Raiders Playtest, The finals, BF6, Factorio, Halo Infinite, Returnal.\n\n# Quality:\n\n* **Stand:** The MSI stand is interesting because it feels expensive yet cheap. I think the metal base and looks make it seem high quality but the plastics feel a little cheap and the height adjustment is a little disappointing. It goes about half an inch lower than the KTC and monitors unboxed mentioned this. The MSI's rotating and pivoting feels good. No issues there. Definitely feels higher quality than KTC. The KTC feels a little flimsier and has less friction overall which doesn’t feel as luxurious, but it gets the job done. KTC is all plastic, no metal base.\n* **Joystick:** The MSI is on another level here. The texture on the button is nice and it’s firm and tactile. Definitely feels like when you first use the Xbox Elite series controller. Everything feels tight. It’s also lit, so that’s kinda nice. The KTC is again flimsy and honestly feels like it’s been used for years. It literally has stick drift brand new and it’s also in the back instead of the bottom so it’s harder to reach. \n\n# Monitor Build/looks:\n\nAgain the MSI wins hands down Looks better from the back, the chin doesn’t bother me. Creaking and build quality seems similar.\n\n# Accessories:\n\nThe MSI has white cables which is nice. I don’t really care but if you do it’s a nice add on. Although the MSI cables feel a little short. KTC are black and again fine. Both have the usb type b as the KVM but the msi has a slightly different shaped plug. Not sure what’s up with that. Ports are fine. \n\n# Software:\n\nMSI wins in some areas and KTC in others. As I said before, it has better customization. It has more crosshairs and the crosshair changes color. You can also update the firmware so there is optimism if anything needs to be fixed and in my experience something does seriously need to get fixed. But I’ll get to that later. You can customize which quick setting is set for each of the four directions. And dual mode is accessible with 2 button clicks. The MSI also has a desktop app so you can configure it there. Pretty nice.  The ktc is non customizable and dual mode has to be dug in the settings. BUT, you can actually control gamma, hue, and saturation on it. In case you need to make adjustments with that. It also has more HDR modes. I kept it on the Vesa one the whole time. Keep in mind the KTC likely will not have hardware updates. On their website it says firmware is final, so that’s a little concerning. \n\n# Dual Monitor:\n\nWould not recommend the 1080 mode on either. It’s so blurry imo. I have 3 1080p 27 inch monitors for work and they are much clearer. I had to play some games with AA off to make it more bearable. Or maybe TAA and Non Integer scaling don’t work for me. Too fuzzy and made my eyes strain and my head hurt. You might be ok. \n\n# Now the Good Stuff!\n\n# Response:\n\nIn SDR the input lag is imperceptible to me on both displays. And it seems in professional testing that it’s around 5 ms without Local Dimming so it’s not really an issue. Felt snappy and didn’t notice any issues at 4k 60hz or 4k 120HZ+.\n\nIn HDR, it was a little difficult. I feel like it was just barely close enough to not feel it. What I mean is, you get used to it so fast since it’s so small, if you can feel it. This is unlike frame gen which adds significant input lag and I can feel it every time. So, HDR or Local Dimming in SDR had no issues with input lag on both monitors. It felt fine to me running at mostly 120fps+ on the competitive games I played (The Finals, Arc Raiders Playtest, BF6). YMMV.\n\n# Brightness:\n\nIn SDR, the ktc gets significantly brighter. It easily outshines the MSI. The MSI by comparison looks a little bit dull. I find that confusing as it’s the same panel and it’s SDR, neither is hitting 1000+ nits. The MSI felt around 400 nits, the KTC felt maybe close to double which is crazy. They both get low enough to not have any issues in the dark. \n\nIn HDR, I had weird issues. When running 2 monitors at HDR on windows, it seemed to prefer the MSI all the time. It worked well with auto HDR, and was brighter than the KTC consistently. Which made no sense as the KTC 100 percent is brighter on other platforms. Could be because I have an amd card or could just be KTC and windows. I tried HDMI, DP, different cables, different ports, and updated to 25H2 to see if it was fixed. YMMV. \n\nIn Linux and on my Chromecast, the KTC gets what seems 30-50% brighter than the MSI consistently. The MSI is good, but the KTC actually blows you away a bit and easily destroys my LG CX. \n\nReally only used Linux to A/B test with Windows for some of the issues I had. Didn’t play games since Linux HDR support is iffy. \n\n# HDR Color:\n\nThis is the point where hopefully I don’t get called a hypocrite. If you look at my comment history I recommended the E16M consistently once I got it. But I was mistaken. At first when I received the MSI, I thought the KTC looked washed out and overbrightened. But really the MSI is saturated, unnaturally so.  Even when trying to dull everything down with HDR calibration and the ODS settings. The greens on the MSI look too green. The trees, grass, and plants are too vibrant. The reds are too red.  Dirt, house colors, the sun, even the color of an owl looks to yellowy/orange. Watching this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s), the sunsets look too deeply red. Not at all like real life. The houses at 13:43 don’t look a pale, sun beaten orange. It seems like somebody dropped a bit of highlighter red on them and they pop too much. At 5:31 the yellow line on the road looks too orangey-yellowish. I know what those lines look like in real life and they don’t look red shifted. Feels like I’m looking at a Samsung AMOLED from like 10 years ago with the vivid setting set to max. I tried everything, updated the firmware, calibrated, changed cables, changed OS’s, installed the msi driver, used the icc profile from msi, tried the desktop software to try and force the movie preset for more accuracy. I even changed the saturation and color on amd’s adrenalin. Nothing fixed it. It happens in both linux, windows, and my Chromecast so I know it’s the panel/firmware/calibration. It’s very unfortunate because once you catch it in a video or movie. It really irks you that the colors are unrealistic.\n\nFunnily it helps BF6 not look washed out, but it's not good for more regular naturally lit content.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the KTC destroys the MSI in colors, especially in HDR. Compared to my OLED TV and OLED iphone 16PM, the KTC is basically the same. The colors are accurate and realistic in HDR. And the brightness is freaking awesome. The problem is the KTC is not detected by auto HDR usually, and is very wonky with Windows. So it's hard to test video games that don't have native HDR. The MSI was consistently using auto HDR which was awesome for me since I don’t have an Nvidia gpu. \n\nAlso, at really bright, white scenes, the MSI loses detail. On a scene with a white cat laying down on top of a white blanket, the MSI is just overblown white on the blanket, while KTC preserves detail and you can see the individual blanket strings and the reflections at the tips. \n\n# SDR colors:\n\nIn SDR the panels are very close, although the MSI is slightly saturated still. But it would be passable. It seems they are suitable for professional work due to the clamping down. The sRGB modes looked identical to me. \n\nNote: Don’t touch the “premium color” gaming option on the MSI at HDR. All the saturation gets even worse and looks horribly overcolored. in SDR, it's ok. Makes everything pop a lot.\n\n# HDR Contrast/Blooming:\n\nBlooming is handled better by the MSI. It’s not a stomping, but the MSI gets a bit darker and has a bit less blooming. This is probably related to the brightness with the KTC being brighter. Although blooming is still well controlled, just not as excellently as the MSI. It's actually difficult to notice blooming on the MSI sometimes. It’s there but you have to pay attention to it. Once you play or watch a video you’ll never notice it again unless it's the youtube video menu's at the edge. I think since those are at the edge and because they cover so much they can be more noticeable. The KTC is close but you can see it a little easier. TBH, neither broke immersion or caused any issues. It’s just whether you want better contrast and less eye searing light scenes or slightly worse contrast but blinding bright snow scenes. Both do well. Although I have to say, the MSI only does this well on the highest LD setting, the other two settings still have that IPS glow. The KTC has 3 levels and all show what you expect of Mini-LED just at different aggressiveness with the brightness suffering at the highest level.\n\nNote: You can use LD in SDR content but you have to be comfortable with haloing and artifacting around text. Especially on grey backgrounds like youtube, steam, etc.. \n\n# Productivity:\n\nBoth are awesome for this. IPS at 4k 27 inch. Text is perfect and no eyestrain. Whites on the KTC are actually white though. The MSI are grayish white it seems again. I think my panel is borked. Or could be brightness issues again, but the MSI does not look white. Even after calibration and on full brightness\n\n# Issues: \n\n**MSI:** Actually I would’ve kept the MSI if color reproduction was good and whites we’re… white. It worked every time with windows and auto HDR actually worked consistently. Never had issues with games or playing anything. The software is nice too along with the desktop app. It’s really just the color inaccuracy which is unacceptable. I think something was definitely wrong with it but not enough to not be sent out. Annoying. \n\n**KTC:** It didn’t play that well with windows. HDR colors looked washed out on the desktop and auto HDR only turned on in a couple of games as opposed to MSI. If it was consistent, this is a killer panel and awesome monitor. The colors and brightness are exactly what you expect out of this type of tech. I’m kinda sad I couldn’t keep this one tbh…..\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAt the end of the day. Neither of the monitors worked out for me for different issues. The KSI has the better panel (or calibration), the MSI the better software. I think I’ll be returning them both and going back to my dual 1440p fast IPS monitors. I can’t justify spending half a rack for something that doesn’t work right and waiting for hopefully some update that fixes it. I’ll wait to see if things are ironed out and maybe try again at a later date. OLED is a no go for me since I do development work and supposed eye strain. I hope this helps and if you buy either, I hope you have no issues. \n\nLet me know if you want to know anything else. I’ll be returning them within the next week so I can answer any questions while they are on my desk. AND if you have any suggestions for solutions. I’m open to it!\n\nThanks for your time!",

I really want OLED quality as it looks like ASD but worried about text clarity and burn in mainly. Samsung on the other hand is IPS so i expect colours will be a bit washed out and generally reviews are mixed bag. Here i can’t really return the monitors, Samsung doesn’t do return at all unless faulty. ",

No matter if ACM is on or off, all colors are oversaturated. I don't want to use the sRGB mode of the monitor or clamp the whole OS to sRGB via GPU driver because when I don't want to change all the settings every time I consume content with a wide gamut. \n\nWhat do I have to do to got accurate colors? I noticed that with HDR enabled it looks a lot better, still more saturated but better. Small follow-up question on that topic, how can I check if the HDR output is correct? DisplayCAL does not support HDR, and I'm not sure if it is a bit more vibrant because the creator of the HDR content actually intended it, or if it is more vibrant because the HDR mode of my monitor is oversaturated.",

It's a [27\" BenQ GW2760HL](https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/8d7a1439) (1080p, 60Hz, 4ms). I mainly use it for gaming, browsing, and some audio work.\n\nI bought it in 2019.

I’ve watched a couple of YouTube reviews and saw there was the possibility of burn-in with OLEDs, especially with mixed use. This gave me some concerns for when I’ll be using it with the Mac Mini where I’ll have static images and toolbars constantly present on the screen for hours. \n\nAn alternative option I had was Mini-LED. From the reviews I’ve seen it’s the next best thing in terms of image quality and doesn’t have the downsides of potential burn-in with mixed use. The monitor I was considering was the MSI MPG 274URDFW E16. It had good reviews, offers more than what I actually need and is less than half the price of the Asus. But, it’s not an OLED. \n\nI really had my heart set on an OLED, so am I being too paranoid about burn-in and should just go for it? Should I go with the more sensible option with the MSI? Or is there any different option you would suggest instead?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated :)",

I also like the big 32″ LG.. it’s huge, which is nice, but of course that means lower pixel density.\n\nSpecs:\n\nACER XB273UV3\n-167,23€\n-IPS Panel\n-27\" \n-WQHD \n-180Hz\n-FreeSync Premium\n-350cd/m²\n-VESA DisplayHDR 400\n\nSAMSUNG Odyssey G55C S27CG554EU\n-154€\n-VA Panel\n-27\" \n-Curved \n-WQHD \n-165Hz(140Hz native)\n-FreeSync\n-300cd/m²\n-HDR10\n\nLG 32GS60QC-B \n-159,90€\n-VA Panel\n-32\" \n-WQHD \n-Curved \n-180Hz\n-FreeSync\n-300cd/m²\n-HDR10\n\n\nThank you! :)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1ofzgri)",

I play single player games, do programming, watching Netflix, Anime etc. and browsing. I was leaning towards the AW2725DM since it has Freesync and Gsync compatible but the lack of audio jack or speakers is bugging me, as I use to for my PC, laptop, office laptop and PS5. It seems the only option I have for AW2725DM (correct me if I am wrong) is using HDMI audio extractor which adds to the cost. If I increase the budget like by 150 bucks is there a monitor better than these 2?",

I'm hoping that I'm just overlooking some good options.  My minimum requirements are:\n\n- standard 4k resolution (not ultrawide)\n\n- 39-43 inches\n\n- 3ms response time or less ( <= 1ms preferred )\n\n- 60Hz refresh rate (120+ preferred)\n\n- excellent text clarity\n\n- not OLED - burn in scares me for this type of usage",

Something that just looks great to look at and easy on the eyes as some screens give me a headache.\n\nThe part I’m a bit confused about is the difference between VA and IPS panels when it comes to picture quality, contrast, and colour accuracy. I’ve read mixed opinions online.\n\nHere are my top contenders (not limited to): \nDell S3425DW \nDell P3425WE \nLG 34WR55QK-B \nMSI MPG 346CQRF X24 \nAOC CU34G2XPD\n\nWould really appreciate your advice or personal experience with any of these.",

    "selftext": "\nFirst of all, sorry if I make any grammatical mistakes; I’m not a native English speaker, but I’ll try to explain myself as clearly as possible.\n\nAlright, let me give a bit of context. I’m a computer engineering student, and I have an Asus TUF Gaming F15 with an i7 13620H processor and an NVIDIA 4060 GPU. I use it for programming, studying, watching videos and movies, and playing games (I don’t play many FPS games; I prefer AAA titles and LoL hahaha). Basically, it’s an all-rounder. I know a laptop isn’t the most optimal thing in the world, but it’s very convenient for taking it to class, moving houses, etc.\n\nLately, after spending so many hours in front of the computer, I get tired very quickly, and I can’t spend more than 30 minutes straight programming or studying because with that small 15” screen and a keyboard that isn’t the most comfortable, I end up feeling overwhelmed. I don’t really know how to explain it, but after two years it’s like whenever I have to sit down to program, it feels really exhausting.\n\nSo I thought that to get the best of both a laptop and a desktop, I could set up a workstation at home to use my laptop like a tower PC, with a proper setup including a monitor (I think 1440p is optimal for my F15) and a keyboard (I was thinking of the Razer BlackWidow V3 TKL, but I’m open to suggestions). I’d also like minimal compatibility with the PS5, since I already have one, so I might as well use it.\n\nThe monitor is where I have doubts. I’ve been obsessed for weeks watching reviews, rankings, etc. In the price range I want, >€250, I’ve found two main contenders: the MSI MAG 274QRF-QD E2 and the AOC Q27G3XMN.\n\nI’ve read that the MSI has really good colors and comes highly recommended, but I honestly haven’t found many reviews. I relied a lot on the specs, and there’s no RTINGS review of this E2 model, only the previous one, which they tore apart for its HDR, basically calling it trash hahaha. This one has been seen here in Spain, where I live, for around €230-240, so I suppose during Black Friday it might drop to about €220.\n\nAny suggestion??? Any model that im missing?? \n\n",

I cant go any higher on the refresh rate - if i use e.g. `140`, `144` or `240` it just results in a black screen. \n\nHere's my questions:\n- Why cant i go higher on custom refresh rate - theoretically the display should be able to handle up to 240hz? \n- Would a custom (kernel/software) EDID solve this issue? If so - what are the risks? I'm not overclocking per se (it supports 240hz natively), so it might not be a problem? (I will *not* flash an EDID to the display via IPC, only sideload the EDID on the kernel side).\n\nThanks\n",

    "selftext": "So I was recently in the market for a high end gaming+productivity monitor, decided to give miniLED a shot, KTC M27P6 specifically. I have plenty of experience with miniLED from current high end macbooks, so I thought if I could get something similar that would be great. Boy was it not even close. So local dimming ON in normal OS usage and web browsing looks horrific and is completely unusable. Every window thats not with pure black or white background is completely non-uniform with a gigantic darker halo following the cursor. Later I found out that apparently with external miniled monitors you are supposed to run local dimming exclusively for videos and games, and switch it off and have normal IPS mode for the OS. Is that actually the case for every external miniled monitor on the market? Even by legit brands like asus/samsung? You can't even enjoy the benefits of miniled in normal OS use with occasional black background for a website or a picture? I'll give it a bit of credit in terms of looking better than normal IPS in games and videos, and the LD off mode looks like a perfectly fine raw IPS monitor with phenomenal brightness too, I just have a hard time getting behind not being able to \"set and forget\" the monitor settings as well as not being able to use LD on for general OS use. Btw LD auto mode doesn't actually remove the need for manual switching, it just ties it to the hdr, so you have to manually switch HDR. Apple seems to have pulled off local dimming zones being on permanently and looking decent by having 6x the zone density and having a tight controller integration into the frame drawing pipeline. If this is indeed the state of miniled monitors on the market rn, this is just another reason to ditch LCD for oled. Unless I'm missing something?",

    "selftext": "We’ve started a **partnership with Titan Army** and will be showcasing new models going forward (with honest community feedback) and probably some giveaways in the future. First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters. [P2712V Link](https://bit.ly/4gmDFse)\n\n**P275MV Plus (Mini-LED with DyDs)**\n\n* Same **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** dual mode\n* **Mini-LED FALD (1152 zones), HDR1000**\n* **What is DyDs**: the backlight is driven in sync with the panel update to keep motion clean **with local dimming on** and to improve visibility in dark scenes (less smearing/black crush than typical FALD IPS). [P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

    "title": "MSI MPG 274URDFW E16M vs KTC M27P6 Comparison:",
    "selftext": "Hey ya’ll, I finally got around to making this review/comparison. I’m currently running side by side mounted on their stands. Please note I have no professional equipment and this is all just side by side comparison. I did come from a nice IPS display that was an omen 27qs and I have an LG CX oled TV for comparison. Used my iphone 16 PM as well lol. \n\n[Proof!](https://preview.redd.it/jqjmjoq0ndxf1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b3b88da3874fcf3f64fdc764c7546dbe17adb33)\n\n**GPU: RX 9070xt**  \n**OS:** Linux (CachyOS) and Windows 11 Pro 24H2.  \n**Connection:** OEM Included DP cables.  \n**Games Tested**: Stalker 2, Arc Raiders Playtest, The finals, BF6, Factorio, Halo Infinite, Returnal.\n\n# Quality:\n\n* **Stand:** The MSI stand is interesting because it feels expensive yet cheap. I think the metal base and looks make it seem high quality but the plastics feel a little cheap and the height adjustment is a little disappointing. It goes about half an inch lower than the KTC and monitors unboxed mentioned this. The MSI's rotating and pivoting feels good. No issues there. Definitely feels higher quality than KTC. The KTC feels a little flimsier and has less friction overall which doesn’t feel as luxurious, but it gets the job done. KTC is all plastic, no metal base.\n* **Joystick:** The MSI is on another level here. The texture on the button is nice and it’s firm and tactile. Definitely feels like when you first use the Xbox Elite series controller. Everything feels tight. It’s also lit, so that’s kinda nice. The KTC is again flimsy and honestly feels like it’s been used for years. It literally has stick drift brand new and it’s also in the back instead of the bottom so it’s harder to reach. \n\n# Monitor Build/looks:\n\nAgain the MSI wins hands down Looks better from the back, the chin doesn’t bother me. Creaking and build quality seems similar.\n\n# Accessories:\n\nThe MSI has white cables which is nice. I don’t really care but if you do it’s a nice add on. Although the MSI cables feel a little short. KTC are black and again fine. Both have the usb type b as the KVM but the msi has a slightly different shaped plug. Not sure what’s up with that. Ports are fine. \n\n# Software:\n\nMSI wins in some areas and KTC in others. As I said before, it has better customization. It has more crosshairs and the crosshair changes color. You can also update the firmware so there is optimism if anything needs to be fixed and in my experience something does seriously need to get fixed. But I’ll get to that later. You can customize which quick setting is set for each of the four directions. And dual mode is accessible with 2 button clicks. The MSI also has a desktop app so you can configure it there. Pretty nice.  The ktc is non customizable and dual mode has to be dug in the settings. BUT, you can actually control gamma, hue, and saturation on it. In case you need to make adjustments with that. It also has more HDR modes. I kept it on the Vesa one the whole time. Keep in mind the KTC likely will not have hardware updates. On their website it says firmware is final, so that’s a little concerning. \n\n# Dual Monitor:\n\nWould not recommend the 1080 mode on either. It’s so blurry imo. I have 3 1080p 27 inch monitors for work and they are much clearer. I had to play some games with AA off to make it more bearable. Or maybe TAA and Non Integer scaling don’t work for me. Too fuzzy and made my eyes strain and my head hurt. You might be ok. \n\n# Now the Good Stuff!\n\n# Response:\n\nIn SDR the input lag is imperceptible to me on both displays. And it seems in professional testing that it’s around 5 ms without Local Dimming so it’s not really an issue. Felt snappy and didn’t notice any issues at 4k 60hz or 4k 120HZ+.\n\nIn HDR, it was a little difficult. I feel like it was just barely close enough to not feel it. What I mean is, you get used to it so fast since it’s so small, if you can feel it. This is unlike frame gen which adds significant input lag and I can feel it every time. So, HDR or Local Dimming in SDR had no issues with input lag on both monitors. It felt fine to me running at mostly 120fps+ on the competitive games I played (The Finals, Arc Raiders Playtest, BF6). YMMV.\n\n# Brightness:\n\nIn SDR, the ktc gets significantly brighter. It easily outshines the MSI. The MSI by comparison looks a little bit dull. I find that confusing as it’s the same panel and it’s SDR, neither is hitting 1000+ nits. The MSI felt around 400 nits, the KTC felt maybe close to double which is crazy. They both get low enough to not have any issues in the dark. \n\nIn HDR, I had weird issues. When running 2 monitors at HDR on windows, it seemed to prefer the MSI all the time. It worked well with auto HDR, and was brighter than the KTC consistently. Which made no sense as the KTC 100 percent is brighter on other platforms. Could be because I have an amd card or could just be KTC and windows. I tried HDMI, DP, different cables, different ports, and updated to 25H2 to see if it was fixed. YMMV. \n\nIn Linux and on my Chromecast, the KTC gets what seems 30-50% brighter than the MSI consistently. The MSI is good, but the KTC actually blows you away a bit and easily destroys my LG CX. \n\nReally only used Linux to A/B test with Windows for some of the issues I had. Didn’t play games since Linux HDR support is iffy. \n\n# HDR Color:\n\nThis is the point where hopefully I don’t get called a hypocrite. If you look at my comment history I recommended the E16M consistently once I got it. But I was mistaken. At first when I received the MSI, I thought the KTC looked washed out and overbrightened. But really the MSI is saturated, unnaturally so.  Even when trying to dull everything down with HDR calibration and the ODS settings. The greens on the MSI look too green. The trees, grass, and plants are too vibrant. The reds are too red.  Dirt, house colors, the sun, even the color of an owl looks to yellowy/orange. Watching this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s), the sunsets look too deeply red. Not at all like real life. The houses at 13:43 don’t look a pale, sun beaten orange. It seems like somebody dropped a bit of highlighter red on them and they pop too much. At 5:31 the yellow line on the road looks too orangey-yellowish. I know what those lines look like in real life and they don’t look red shifted. Feels like I’m looking at a Samsung AMOLED from like 10 years ago with the vivid setting set to max. I tried everything, updated the firmware, calibrated, changed cables, changed OS’s, installed the msi driver, used the icc profile from msi, tried the desktop software to try and force the movie preset for more accuracy. I even changed the saturation and color on amd’s adrenalin. Nothing fixed it. It happens in both linux, windows, and my Chromecast so I know it’s the panel/firmware/calibration. It’s very unfortunate because once you catch it in a video or movie. It really irks you that the colors are unrealistic.\n\nFunnily it helps BF6 not look washed out, but it's not good for more regular naturally lit content.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the KTC destroys the MSI in colors, especially in HDR. Compared to my OLED TV and OLED iphone 16PM, the KTC is basically the same. The colors are accurate and realistic in HDR. And the brightness is freaking awesome. The problem is the KTC is not detected by auto HDR usually, and is very wonky with Windows. So it's hard to test video games that don't have native HDR. The MSI was consistently using auto HDR which was awesome for me since I don’t have an Nvidia gpu. \n\nAlso, at really bright, white scenes, the MSI loses detail. On a scene with a white cat laying down on top of a white blanket, the MSI is just overblown white on the blanket, while KTC preserves detail and you can see the individual blanket strings and the reflections at the tips. \n\n# SDR colors:\n\nIn SDR the panels are very close, although the MSI is slightly saturated still. But it would be passable. It seems they are suitable for professional work due to the clamping down. The sRGB modes looked identical to me. \n\nNote: Don’t touch the “premium color” gaming option on the MSI at HDR. All the saturation gets even worse and looks horribly overcolored. in SDR, it's ok. Makes everything pop a lot.\n\n# HDR Contrast/Blooming:\n\nBlooming is handled better by the MSI. It’s not a stomping, but the MSI gets a bit darker and has a bit less blooming. This is probably related to the brightness with the KTC being brighter. Although blooming is still well controlled, just not as excellently as the MSI. It's actually difficult to notice blooming on the MSI sometimes. It’s there but you have to pay attention to it. Once you play or watch a video you’ll never notice it again unless it's the youtube video menu's at the edge. I think since those are at the edge and because they cover so much they can be more noticeable. The KTC is close but you can see it a little easier. TBH, neither broke immersion or caused any issues. It’s just whether you want better contrast and less eye searing light scenes or slightly worse contrast but blinding bright snow scenes. Both do well. Although I have to say, the MSI only does this well on the highest LD setting, the other two settings still have that IPS glow. The KTC has 3 levels and all show what you expect of Mini-LED just at different aggressiveness with the brightness suffering at the highest level.\n\nNote: You can use LD in SDR content but you have to be comfortable with haloing and artifacting around text. Especially on grey backgrounds like youtube, steam, etc.. \n\n# Productivity:\n\nBoth are awesome for this. IPS at 4k 27 inch. Text is perfect and no eyestrain. Whites on the KTC are actually white though. The MSI are grayish white it seems again. I think my panel is borked. Or could be brightness issues again, but the MSI does not look white. Even after calibration and on full brightness\n\n# Issues: \n\n**MSI:** Actually I would’ve kept the MSI if color reproduction was good and whites we’re… white. It worked every time with windows and auto HDR actually worked consistently. Never had issues with games or playing anything. The software is nice too along with the desktop app. It’s really just the color inaccuracy which is unacceptable. I think something was definitely wrong with it but not enough to not be sent out. Annoying. \n\n**KTC:** It didn’t play that well with windows. HDR colors looked washed out on the desktop and auto HDR only turned on in a couple of games as opposed to MSI. If it was consistent, this is a killer panel and awesome monitor. The colors and brightness are exactly what you expect out of this type of tech. I’m kinda sad I couldn’t keep this one tbh…..\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAt the end of the day. Neither of the monitors worked out for me for different issues. The KSI has the better panel (or calibration), the MSI the better software. I think I’ll be returning them both and going back to my dual 1440p fast IPS monitors. I can’t justify spending half a rack for something that doesn’t work right and waiting for hopefully some update that fixes it. I’ll wait to see if things are ironed out and maybe try again at a later date. OLED is a no go for me since I do development work and supposed eye strain. I hope this helps and if you buy either, I hope you have no issues. \n\nLet me know if you want to know anything else. I’ll be returning them within the next week so I can answer any questions while they are on my desk. AND if you have any suggestions for solutions. I’m open to it!\n\nThanks for your time!",

    "title": "Does AOC usually screw customers over like this?",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: just ranting over AOC being the type of guy who leaves you on delivered while they're online\n\nI bought a monitor from them during black Friday last year when I saw a nice OLED deal for 400$ (not including tax) for a PC build I was planning. Color saturation was a bit weird (especially for an OLED) no matter how much I tweak with the settings, but otherwise it served me well.\n\nAround August, 9 months after purchase, I noticed some weird glitching at the bottom of the panel. I thought it might be a problem with my PC, thought after days of troubleshooting, I realized the problem was with the monitor since using a different cable with a my old laptop still didn't solve the issue. I contacted AOC about this since then thought various methods, from their official website to their email but with no response, and the issue is only getting worse, because on late August black horizontal bars are all over the monitor and on September 16 the monitor started to black screens every 15 seconds or so for around 4 seconds.\n\nThe warranty I got is 4 years of no dead pixels, 4 years of advanced replacement and a year of free replacement for accidental damage, and with my luck so far I'm sure their gonna find something to get them to have it go under user-damage, and I only got 4 weeks until that expires.\n\n\nWhat hurts is that I spent a lot to ship this monitor to my region and that I sacrificed some of the GPU budget to squeeze in that OLED panel so I guess the moral of the story is don't ship monitors overseas and prioritize performance over display for gaming if you can't stretch your budget\n\n",

    "selftext": "More of a discussion thread. I'd like to hear your thoughts.\n\nSince pixel shift draws a slightly smaller image within my panel and then shifts that around (which, by the way I notice. EVERY time it does it.) this means that either the panel isnt 1440p but bigger, or the displayed image is smaller than 1440p.\n\nI paid for a monitor with a resolution of 2560x1440 and I would like to think that I get to use all of those pixles at the same time without having to \"bunch\" my image by even a fraction of a percent and have 2 rows of pixels merging/overriding each other.\n\nIt doesn't sit well with me to know I'm at no point ever using the entire panel at once which has the specified resolution. I surely cannot be alone with that. I'd like to turn pixel shift off.\n\nIs there a firmware version out there that lets me turn it off? Is my assumption about the panel wrong? Do you have thoughts or opinions to share about burn-in risks without pixel shift? Please let me know.\n\n  \nEdit: Downvoted to zero for a simple question with zero fluff or bullshit. Now nobody that might have valuable input can see this post. Thanks guys",

This is my first IPS monitor so I'm not sure how I feel about the constant noticeable backlighting I can see. (couple screenshots to show what it looks like on camera, which looks way worse in camera than with my human eyes)\n\nI'm doing my best to research and learn about monitors and their features, but admittedly I am still very ignorant.\n\nI came from a Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 and I think the biggest thing I didn't like about that was the ghosting around test and the cursor (which I believe is probably from the fact it was a VA panel?)\n\nI'm not noticing that ghosting issue at all with this MSI IPS monitor, but I'm curious if maybe something like that Innocn GA27T1M being a mini-LED IPS would maybe be that sweet spot?\n\nAlso before I bought the MSI, I tried the new [ASUS XG27UCDMG](https://www.bestbuy.com/product/asus-rog-strix-27-4k-oled-240hz-0-03ms-gaming-monitor-with-freesync-premium-pro-and-hdr-displayport-hdmi-black/JJGGLQ5XSP) and I think I've ultimately decided that OLED is not for me. They're just too dark for my enjoyment.\n\nIf anyone has any advice or recommendations on a 27\" or 32\" 2K or 4K non-OLED monitor, I'd be happy to hear :)\n\nThank you everyone for your time and your advice, and have a great day!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4zkk5almexf1.jpg?width=2104&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70872b4582234ddc7679524a3171700fac0bdeec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yobs5almexf1.jpg?width=1404&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db59b9e83443a78b0914d0fce1e13bfd086a8924",

At some point it all got a little much, cause you have like \"IPS\" and \"VA\" and \"Mini-LED\" and IPS displays can also be Mini-LED at the same time? Just need some suggestions that fall within my requirements and needs.\n\nBudget is around 3000NOK give or take (roughly 300USD) per display, though I'm not looking to get more than two.\n\nHas to be 16:9.\n\nHas to have VESA 100x100mm or 75x75mm mounts.  \nHas to weigh 13kg or less. \n\nPrefer the display to have a physical size of 25 inches, I don't know if could comfortably fit two 27 inch displays next to each other with the space I have, even with monitor arms. And I'd rather have two displays of the same size and not mismatched sizes to work around space constraints.\n\nPrefer 1440p at most, anything above that is overkill IMO.\n\nNot too fuzzy about refresh rate, my current AOC G2590FXs have been capped to 60Hz for the past 7 years despite being 144Hz. If I increased the refresh rate beyond 60 all the colors would become sharper, which isn't inherently bad, but in some games the colors would become so dark it was almost unplayable, and I wasn't able to find any setting on the monitor itself to change the color mode. Not saying I expect this to be the case with all monitors, just saying this was my experience with my first high refresh rate monitor which is why I'm currently not fuzzy about high refresh rates. ",

I tried watching YouTube and downloaded media and Im satisfied switching between both \n\nSince in my country returns if not satisfied is not a thing I might just be disappointed and waste my money for something I can't appreciate.\n\nI've tried watching the 2020 OLED the black hdr from LG global YouTube channel from 2 of my phone's and don't see the difference \n\n\nOne thing I did notice is my 2019 Macbook pro looks so good compared to my 1080p matte monitor is the glossy finish i think or maybe it's just the ppi.\n\n\nIf you guys have any suggestions for ways to discern contrast on lcd and OLED phone that would be great thanks",

OLED is out of the question because I don't want to deal with the inevitable burn in that gives a hard limit to the monitor's lifespan. That leaves IPS, and whether it comes with Mini-LED backlighting or not. \n\nAs of now, I'm not really bothered by \"black isn't really black\" but more the... dynamic range? In some games lots of details seem lost to crushed blacks and clipped highlights. When I turn on HDR the details come back but the colors look kind of wonky, especially in the Windows environment.\n\nWill appreciate feedback from anyone who has experience with the difference between regular IPS and Mini-LED/OLED in not-pitch-black room settings!",

    "selftext": "So I was recently in the market for a high end gaming+productivity monitor, decided to give miniLED a shot, KTC M27P6 specifically. I have plenty of experience with miniLED from current high end macbooks, so I thought if I could get something similar that would be great. Boy was it not even close. So local dimming ON in normal OS usage and web browsing looks horrific and is completely unusable. Every window thats not with pure black or white background is completely non-uniform with a gigantic darker halo following the cursor. Later I found out that apparently with external miniled monitors you are supposed to run local dimming exclusively for videos and games, and switch it off and have normal IPS mode for the OS. Is that actually the case for every external miniled monitor on the market? Even by legit brands like asus/samsung? You can't even enjoy the benefits of miniled in normal OS use with occasional black background for a website or a picture? I'll give it a bit of credit in terms of looking better than normal IPS in games and videos, and the LD off mode looks like a perfectly fine raw IPS monitor with phenomenal brightness too, I just have a hard time getting behind not being able to \"set and forget\" the monitor settings as well as not being able to use LD on for general OS use. Btw LD auto mode doesn't actually remove the need for manual switching, it just ties it to the hdr, so you have to manually switch HDR. Apple seems to have pulled off local dimming zones being on permanently and looking decent by having 6x the zone density and having a tight controller integration into the frame drawing pipeline. If this is indeed the state of miniled monitors on the market rn, this is just another reason to ditch LCD for oled. Unless I'm missing something?",

I think the metal base and looks make it seem high quality but the plastics feel a little cheap and the height adjustment is a little disappointing. It goes about half an inch lower than the KTC and monitors unboxed mentioned this. The MSI's rotating and pivoting feels good. No issues there. Definitely feels higher quality than KTC. The KTC feels a little flimsier and has less friction overall which doesn’t feel as luxurious, but it gets the job done. KTC is all plastic, no metal base.\n* **Joystick:** The MSI is on another level here. The texture on the button is nice and it’s firm and tactile. Definitely feels like when you first use the Xbox Elite series controller. Everything feels tight. It’s also lit, so that’s kinda nice. The KTC is again flimsy and honestly feels like it’s been used for years. It literally has stick drift brand new and it’s also in the back instead of the bottom so it’s harder to reach. \n\n# Monitor Build/looks:\n\nAgain the MSI wins hands down Looks better from the back, the chin doesn’t bother me. Creaking and build quality seems similar.\n\n# Accessories:\n\nThe MSI has white cables which is nice. I don’t really care but if you do it’s a nice add on. Although the MSI cables feel a little short. KTC are black and again fine. Both have the usb type b as the KVM but the msi has a slightly different shaped plug. Not sure what’s up with that. Ports are fine. \n\n# Software:\n\nMSI wins in some areas and KTC in others. As I said before, it has better customization. It has more crosshairs and the crosshair changes color. You can also update the firmware so there is optimism if anything needs to be fixed and in my experience something does seriously need to get fixed. But I’ll get to that later. You can customize which quick setting is set for each of the four directions. And dual mode is accessible with 2 button clicks. The MSI also has a desktop app so you can configure it there. Pretty nice.  The ktc is non customizable and dual mode has to be dug in the settings. BUT, you can actually control gamma, hue, and saturation on it. In case you need to make adjustments with that. It also has more HDR modes. I kept it on the Vesa one the whole time. Keep in mind the KTC likely will not have hardware updates. On their website it says firmware is final, so that’s a little concerning. \n\n# Dual Monitor:\n\nWould not recommend the 1080 mode on either. It’s so blurry imo. I have 3 1080p 27 inch monitors for work and they are much clearer. I had to play some games with AA off to make it more bearable. Or maybe TAA and Non Integer scaling don’t work for me. Too fuzzy and made my eyes strain and my head hurt. You might be ok. \n\n# Now the Good Stuff!\n\n# Response:\n\nIn SDR the input lag is imperceptible to me on both displays. And it seems in professional testing that it’s around 5 ms without Local Dimming so it’s not really an issue. Felt snappy and didn’t notice any issues at 4k 60hz or 4k 120HZ+.\n\nIn HDR, it was a little difficult. I feel like it was just barely close enough to not feel it. What I mean is, you get used to it so fast since it’s so small, if you can feel it. This is unlike frame gen which adds significant input lag and I can feel it every time. So, HDR or Local Dimming in SDR had no issues with input lag on both monitors. It felt fine to me running at mostly 120fps+ on the competitive games I played (The Finals, Arc Raiders Playtest, BF6). YMMV.\n\n# Brightness:\n\nIn SDR, the ktc gets significantly brighter. It easily outshines the MSI. The MSI by comparison looks a little bit dull. I find that confusing as it’s the same panel and it’s SDR, neither is hitting 1000+ nits. The MSI felt around 400 nits, the KTC felt maybe close to double which is crazy. They both get low enough to not have any issues in the dark. \n\nIn HDR, I had weird issues. When running 2 monitors at HDR on windows, it seemed to prefer the MSI all the time. It worked well with auto HDR, and was brighter than the KTC consistently. Which made no sense as the KTC 100 percent is brighter on other platforms. Could be because I have an amd card or could just be KTC and windows. I tried HDMI, DP, different cables, different ports, and updated to 25H2 to see if it was fixed. YMMV. \n\nIn Linux and on my Chromecast, the KTC gets what seems 30-50% brighter than the MSI consistently. The MSI is good, but the KTC actually blows you away a bit and easily destroys my LG CX. \n\nReally only used Linux to A/B test with Windows for some of the issues I had. Didn’t play games since Linux HDR support is iffy. \n\n# HDR Color:\n\nThis is the point where hopefully I don’t get called a hypocrite. If you look at my comment history I recommended the E16M consistently once I got it. But I was mistaken. At first when I received the MSI, I thought the KTC looked washed out and overbrightened. But really the MSI is saturated, unnaturally so.  Even when trying to dull everything down with HDR calibration and the ODS settings. The greens on the MSI look too green. The trees, grass, and plants are too vibrant. The reds are too red.  Dirt, house colors, the sun, even the color of an owl looks to yellowy/orange. Watching this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s), the sunsets look too deeply red. Not at all like real life. The houses at 13:43 don’t look a pale, sun beaten orange. It seems like somebody dropped a bit of highlighter red on them and they pop too much. At 5:31 the yellow line on the road looks too orangey-yellowish. I know what those lines look like in real life and they don’t look red shifted. Feels like I’m looking at a Samsung AMOLED from like 10 years ago with the vivid setting set to max. I tried everything, updated the firmware, calibrated, changed cables, changed OS’s, installed the msi driver, used the icc profile from msi, tried the desktop software to try and force the movie preset for more accuracy. I even changed the saturation and color on amd’s adrenalin. Nothing fixed it. It happens in both linux, windows, and my Chromecast so I know it’s the panel/firmware/calibration. It’s very unfortunate because once you catch it in a video or movie. It really irks you that the colors are unrealistic.\n\nFunnily it helps BF6 not look washed out, but it's not good for more regular naturally lit content.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the KTC destroys the MSI in colors, especially in HDR. Compared to my OLED TV and OLED iphone 16PM, the KTC is basically the same. The colors are accurate and realistic in HDR. And the brightness is freaking awesome. The problem is the KTC is not detected by auto HDR usually, and is very wonky with Windows. So it's hard to test video games that don't have native HDR. The MSI was consistently using auto HDR which was awesome for me since I don’t have an Nvidia gpu. \n\nAlso, at really bright, white scenes, the MSI loses detail. On a scene with a white cat laying down on top of a white blanket, the MSI is just overblown white on the blanket, while KTC preserves detail and you can see the individual blanket strings and the reflections at the tips. \n\n# SDR colors:\n\nIn SDR the panels are very close, although the MSI is slightly saturated still. But it would be passable. It seems they are suitable for professional work due to the clamping down. The sRGB modes looked identical to me. \n\nNote: Don’t touch the “premium color” gaming option on the MSI at HDR. All the saturation gets even worse and looks horribly overcolored. in SDR, it's ok. Makes everything pop a lot.\n\n# HDR Contrast/Blooming:\n\nBlooming is handled better by the MSI. It’s not a stomping, but the MSI gets a bit darker and has a bit less blooming. This is probably related to the brightness with the KTC being brighter. Although blooming is still well controlled, just not as excellently as the MSI. It's actually difficult to notice blooming on the MSI sometimes. It’s there but you have to pay attention to it. Once you play or watch a video you’ll never notice it again unless it's the youtube video menu's at the edge. I think since those are at the edge and because they cover so much they can be more noticeable. The KTC is close but you can see it a little easier. TBH, neither broke immersion or caused any issues. It’s just whether you want better contrast and less eye searing light scenes or slightly worse contrast but blinding bright snow scenes. Both do well. Although I have to say, the MSI only does this well on the highest LD setting, the other two settings still have that IPS glow. The KTC has 3 levels and all show what you expect of Mini-LED just at different aggressiveness with the brightness suffering at the highest level.\n\nNote: You can use LD in SDR content but you have to be comfortable with haloing and artifacting around text. Especially on grey backgrounds like youtube, steam, etc.. \n\n# Productivity:\n\nBoth are awesome for this. IPS at 4k 27 inch. Text is perfect and no eyestrain. Whites on the KTC are actually white though. The MSI are grayish white it seems again. I think my panel is borked. Or could be brightness issues again, but the MSI does not look white. Even after calibration and on full brightness\n\n# Issues: \n\n**MSI:** Actually I would’ve kept the MSI if color reproduction was good and whites we’re… white. It worked every time with windows and auto HDR actually worked consistently. Never had issues with games or playing anything. The software is nice too along with the desktop app. It’s really just the color inaccuracy which is unacceptable. I think something was definitely wrong with it but not enough to not be sent out. Annoying. \n\n**KTC:** It didn’t play that well with windows. HDR colors looked washed out on the desktop and auto HDR only turned on in a couple of games as opposed to MSI. If it was consistent, this is a killer panel and awesome monitor. The colors and brightness are exactly what you expect out of this type of tech. I’m kinda sad I couldn’t keep this one tbh…..\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAt the end of the day. Neither of the monitors worked out for me for different issues. The KSI has the better panel (or calibration), the MSI the better software. I think I’ll be returning them both and going back to my dual 1440p fast IPS monitors. I can’t justify spending half a rack for something that doesn’t work right and waiting for hopefully some update that fixes it. I’ll wait to see if things are ironed out and maybe try again at a later date. OLED is a no go for me since I do development work and supposed eye strain. I hope this helps and if you buy either, I hope you have no issues. \n\nLet me know if you want to know anything else. I’ll be returning them within the next week so I can answer any questions while they are on my desk. AND if you have any suggestions for solutions. I’m open to it!\n\nThanks for your time!",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: just ranting over AOC being the type of guy who leaves you on delivered while they're online\n\nI bought a monitor from them during black Friday last year when I saw a nice OLED deal for 400$ (not including tax) for a PC build I was planning. Color saturation was a bit weird (especially for an OLED) no matter how much I tweak with the settings, but otherwise it served me well.\n\nAround August, 9 months after purchase, I noticed some weird glitching at the bottom of the panel. I thought it might be a problem with my PC, thought after days of troubleshooting, I realized the problem was with the monitor since using a different cable with a my old laptop still didn't solve the issue. I contacted AOC about this since then thought various methods, from their official website to their email but with no response, and the issue is only getting worse, because on late August black horizontal bars are all over the monitor and on September 16 the monitor started to black screens every 15 seconds or so for around 4 seconds.\n\nThe warranty I got is 4 years of no dead pixels, 4 years of advanced replacement and a year of free replacement for accidental damage, and with my luck so far I'm sure their gonna find something to get them to have it go under user-damage, and I only got 4 weeks until that expires.\n\n\nWhat hurts is that I spent a lot to ship this monitor to my region and that I sacrificed some of the GPU budget to squeeze in that OLED panel so I guess the moral of the story is don't ship monitors overseas and prioritize performance over display for gaming if you can't stretch your budget\n\n",

    "selftext": "More of a discussion thread. I'd like to hear your thoughts.\n\nSince pixel shift draws a slightly smaller image within my panel and then shifts that around (which, by the way I notice. EVERY time it does it.) this means that either the panel isnt 1440p but bigger, or the displayed image is smaller than 1440p.\n\nI paid for a monitor with a resolution of 2560x1440 and I would like to think that I get to use all of those pixles at the same time without having to \"bunch\" my image by even a fraction of a percent and have 2 rows of pixels merging/overriding each other.\n\nIt doesn't sit well with me to know I'm at no point ever using the entire panel at once which has the specified resolution. I surely cannot be alone with that. I'd like to turn pixel shift off.\n\nIs there a firmware version out there that lets me turn it off? Is my assumption about the panel wrong? Do you have thoughts or opinions to share about burn-in risks without pixel shift? Please let me know.\n\n  \nEdit: Downvoted to zero for a simple question with zero fluff or bullshit. Now nobody that might have valuable input can see this post. Thanks guys",

At some point it all got a little much, cause you have like \"IPS\" and \"VA\" and \"Mini-LED\" and IPS displays can also be Mini-LED at the same time? Just need some suggestions that fall within my requirements and needs.\n\nBudget is around 3000NOK give or take (roughly 300USD) per display, though I'm not looking to get more than two.\n\nHas to be 16:9.\n\nHas to have VESA 100x100mm or 75x75mm mounts.  \nHas to weigh 13kg or less. \n\nPrefer the display to have a physical size of 25 inches, I don't know if could comfortably fit two 27 inch displays next to each other with the space I have, even with monitor arms. And I'd rather have two displays of the same size and not mismatched sizes to work around space constraints.\n\nPrefer 1440p at most, anything above that is overkill IMO.\n\nNot too fuzzy about refresh rate, my current AOC G2590FXs have been capped to 60Hz for the past 7 years despite being 144Hz. If I increased the refresh rate beyond 60 all the colors would become sharper, which isn't inherently bad, but in some games the colors would become so dark it was almost unplayable, and I wasn't able to find any setting on the monitor itself to change the color mode. Not saying I expect this to be the case with all monitors, just saying this was my experience with my first high refresh rate monitor which is why I'm currently not fuzzy about high refresh rates. ",

We live in a rural area and it’s two hours to the nearest so it’s a novel event and we wandered around checking out everything . Outside of some Bose about 15+ years ago, I’ve never had occasion to be near NC Headphones. \n\nAnyway, I popped these on and EVERYTHING went dead silent. Best of all, my wife’s voice, right in front of my face trying to talk to me. Reminded me of that scene in, I think, Face Off with travolta and cage where someone drops headphones of soothing music on the little 4 yr old kid and then a huge gun battle breaks out. In that crazy, crowded, noisy store I heard nothing but soft cool jazz. I could see my wife’s lips moving but could hear a word and it was pure bliss. Not sure which model I had but they were like $500+ at the time. \n\nQ: Anything BETTER, or cheaper yet still super isolating and effective these days? How would I go about trying other models out? \n\nAlso appreciate advice on replacing ear pads, battery life, overall longevity of devices. ",

Yeah the highs are crisp, and I'll admit footsteps sound good, but I'm not getting the same emersive factor that I was getting from the nova pros. For example jumping out the plane in warzone the wind and engine sounded like it was actually up in your face if that makes sense, but with the Maxwells it just sounds thinned out. I have Atmos and the latest firmware installed and yes I tweaked with the EQ. Is there something I'm missing here?",

Especially the high-quality bass. But one thing that made me really happy as a customer is the accessories you get. When I bought much more expensive headphones, they don't treat you as good as FiiO. You get the regular 3.5mm cable with 6.35mm adapter but also a premium looking case and A BALANCED 4.4MM CABLE! Amazing headphones with amazing accessories. all for an amazing price. It's super convenient because I always wanted a balanced cable for my HD 600 and Edition XS but they are quite expensive. The fact that FiiO included them is just really nice. Now I can use them for my Edition XS without having to go out and look and spend money on them.\n\nThis really reminds me of how cheap smartphones gives you more than $1000 smartphones. You get a screen protector already applied, a free phone case included in the box and of course a should-be-mandatory charging brick. But for $1000 you don't even get a charger, like how is a dude gonna charge the damn phone???",

Out of the box yes but with EQ bass shelf on 6xx it gets much closer. They complement them well. 6xx is more of an intimate sound, XV is more spacious.\n\nKick drums and high hat sound perfect IMO. Love it\n\nOne weird thing I noticed....I always run through freq sweeps and tone generators every once in awhile to make sure there is no driver buzzing or other weird stuff going on.\n\nWith these Edition XV, there is no driver buzzing. However, when running the tone generator on squig.link I notice there is a tone within the tone at various frequencies. Not sure what that's about.\n\n300hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n1700hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n4000hz - left channel there are two seperate freqs coming through\n\n4900hz - right channel tone issue\n\nWould I have ever noticed just listening to music and watching videos? No. But now that I know it's there...\n\nI'll use for a couple weeks and see if it goes away.",

    "selftext": "I recently realized that most of my headphone stands put undue focused pressure on my headbands or compress the pads. I have seen some really nice stands on vids by Resolve (a Focal stand) and GadgetryTech (forget the brand), but those are $250-$500, more than I want to pay for a stand. I found these HiFi For All stands (pictured) which are affordable, and solve the problem, but I would prefer one with a bit of a longer headband area (vs just wide depth-wise). Like the ones on Gadgetry’s vids - there is one that has a little knob that looks like it is for length adjustment that looks nice too, but I can’t find it on the net. (Third picture, from his Aune AR5000 review, sorry for blurriness).\n\nI am thinking there must be some hidden gems out there that are reasonable affordable, and available in the US sans tariff/import fees, preferably.",

I never had a issue with the XS comfort either, but the Arya's feel so far more comfortable.\n\nThe sound is such an upgrade. Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better. I was listening to my go to testing track Dreams by Fleetwood Mac and song just felt livelier. Stevie Nicks' voice had more character, the kick drums had presence and everything felt musical. The treble is spicy, but in not treble sensitive and actually prefer (call me crazy). The sound stage is bigger too!\n\nI am using these with my Ifi Neo Idsd that using the Burr Brown for reference and power these with ease. \n\nMy edition XS has been great for the last 3 years, but it's time to retire/sell them. I'll be listening to the Aryas and Fiio FT1 from now on, so they don't have any use. \n\nIn conclusion, these are brilliant and very happy I finally pulled the trigger. Well couldn't help it for £585 open box directly from Hifiman and comes with standard warranty 👌🏿. ",

Everything loud (explosions, ambience, gunfire, airstrikes etc.) is overly forward, while footsteps are very hard to pick up. After a full month of trying to adapt, it still feels wrong.\n\nI’ve already watched the well-known EQ videos on YouTube, searched Reddit threads, tried EQ from GPT suggestions and used Sonar / PEACE to do EQ! \n\nBut I still can’t get good game experience. 😂😭\n\nAt this point I’m honestly desperate!! I’m even willing to pay someone if they can help me get a working EQ preset for competitive play. 🙏\n\nIf anyone has a tried-and-tested Warzone EQ for the DT 770 PRO X (48 ohm) specifically — or knows what frequencies need to be reduced/boosted for footstep clarity on this model — I would be extremely grateful.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

The pads start to hurt my bottom left ear which has never happened before with stock pads or the stpad deluxe I have. Both my ears turned quite red. Maybe it’s different for you.\n\nEdit 2: I repositioned the headphone a bit backwards. Seems to help with the ear pain. But I don’t have confidence to say the pads will provide longer session comfort.\n\nUnfortunately, same as the stock pads, stpad2 don't really improve the passive sound isolation.\n\nThe pads noticeably change the sound for the better. You can feel the wider sound stage or I should say the distance the pads created the second you put them on.\n\nLess bass but just right, stock bass was too much for me. Sub bass doesn’t seem to be impacted much.\n\nBetter mids IMO. more separation, details.\n\nTreble is definitely more, airy but not really harsh to me so far.\n\nFeels like the tuning is now neutral bright like IEMs but still has good amount of bass.

    "selftext": "**source:** tidal or personal flac files through bluetooth aptx\n\n**FIT:**\n\nHDB 630 - very comfortable but loosest of the bunch. felt a bit insecure. if l looked up or shook my head I had that feeling they may fall off. smaller ear cups too if you're concern about that and I could feel contact with my ears but nothing uncomfortable for me.\n\nPX7 S3 - slightly more clamping force which got a little uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. best seal out of the bunch so pick your poison.\n\nPx8 S2 - most comfortable. not too tight, not too loose. just right on my head. doesn't feel insecure.\n\n**BUILD QUALITY:**\n\nHDB 630 - decent. I would expect more at this price. honestly feels a bit plasticky and cheap. style also is very bland. doesn't look premium. Also, I personally don't like the swipe touch controls and I found them finicky.\n\nPX7 S3 - excellent. no leather. great styling and premium look. I enjoy the button controls better than the Sennheiser.\n\nPx8 S2 - excellent. has leather if you're concern about that. great styling and premium look even more than the px7. same button controls as the px7.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nHDB 630 - good but not great. with airplane noise it's about the same as the Px7. 630's were better with distinct noises like voices or background noise in a cafe or on a bus.\n\nPX7 S3 - good. not great. pretty good with airplane noise but distinct noises leak through quite a bit.\n\nPx8 S2 - just okay. worst of the bunch surprisingly. let in more airplane noise than the other two and distinct sounds leaked through quite a bit like the Px7\n\n**SQ:**\n\n**HDB 630:**\n\ntuning: pretty neutral\n\nspace and technicalities: space and staging is good. not great but all three are closed back so that's a natural limitation. Sennheiser is more relaxed and less \"fun\" but some audiophiles prefer that. both the Px7 and Px8 everything sounds closer and more \"fun\". good technicalities though. everything feels snappy and controlled. instrument separation is great.\n\nbass: well extended into sub bass and well controlled but is definitely not the star of the show. a bit thin sounding if you're not used to audiophile tuning. they can rumble though if you boost the bass with the EQ\n\nmids: maybe it's the audiophile tuning but it sounds a bit shouty to me. definitely not warm. lower mids seems thin while upper mids sound too forward. vocals sound a bit thin and snares sound a little sharp. actually a bit annoying to my ears but I tend to be treble sensitive.\n\ntreble: great as you would suspect from audiophile tuning. well extended and controlled but do weirdly get harsh for me. again, I'm a bit sensitive to treble so YMMV with that.\n\n**PX7 S3:**\n\ntuning: very bloated bass. maybe you'll like it if you're a basshead. good extension into sub bass but a bit less controlled than the px8 and 630 but still pretty good.\n\nspace and technicalities: worst of the bunch but still pretty good and pleasant to the ears. I only really notice they're worse after listening to the other headphones. both the px8 and 630 extract more detail and sound more spacious and 3D.\n\nbass: way bloated. strong and good extension into sub bass\n\nmids: my favorite here actually. sounds intimate and full. smooth and fun tuning. not shouty.\n\ntreble: my favorite also. sounds well extended and airy but not overly so. doesn't get sharp or shouty. maybe a tad rolled off and recessed compared to true audiophile tuning but to my ear they are close to just right. very pleasant sounding. the treble adds a bit of nice air and sparkle without getting annoying.\n\n**Px8 S2:**\n\ntuning: I would still consider these bass bloated but less so than the px7. mids feel a tiny bit more recessed than the px7 but more present and forward than the 630. more treble presence than the px7. maybe about the same as the 630 but sounds less shouty.\n\nspace and technicalities: very good here. better 3D space and detail than the px7. bass is tighter and transients feels slightly snappier than the px7. similar to the 630 in terms of space and detail but again, the B&Ws feel closer and more \"fun\".\n\nbass: my favorite bass of the three. still sounds bloated to me but less so than the px7. more balanced and controlled than the px7. definitely way more power here than the 630 without EQing.\n\nmids: very good. tiny bit recessed compared to the px7. sounds smooth and balanced.\n\ntreble: very good here. well controlled and extended but still sounds smooth. about the same presence as the 630 but sounds more balanced to me.\n\n**what I'm keeping?**\n\nto my surprise, I think I'm keeping the Px7 S3. I'm hoping the band loosens a bit. the ANC is pretty good especially with airplane noise. the B&W styling is very attractive. mids and highs are great and tuned to my liking. sense of space and technicalities are still very good and pleasant to listen to. and for now, I have the low bass down 3.5 and mid bass down 2.0 and they sound less bloated.",

    "selftext": "To start off, these are such incredible cans. It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

While I think the ATs beat them in imaging, it isn’t that big of a difference. They are less comfortable, don’t have any bass, build quality feels cheap. \n\nI tried them with BF6 and while it was immersive, the moment I put on the 490s after these the difference was apparent. The velour pads work well with my glasses and are way more comfortable than the audio technicas. \n\nI also tried listening to some music, namely BRAT because I love the production on that album and these lacked any sort of punch. I have SONY MDR MV1s coming in tomorrow, will see how they hold up against what I already have. Looking for something more V shaped and lush compared to the 560s sound signature and I’ve heard that the mv1s fit that description well. If they don’t I might return the 490s, R70xas and MV1s and skipping mid fi completely and move to some Hi Fi offerings like Clears/Meze 109 pro/FT7 (because I want to try planars). Any other suggestions are welcome, looking for open backs with a big soundstage as well as a bass boost. Not too concerned with neutrality. ",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 - Maybe Buy 2 Headphones Instead",
    "selftext": "**TLDR:** Good sound, good customization, bad comfort, finnicky connectivity, high price. Audeze Maxwell + Momentum 4 for $50 more (can be less if you're cool with open box) do more things better.\n\n**The positives:**\n\n* **One of the best ever sounding closed backs**, definitely the best I've heard with ANC (vs Bathys, XM5/XM6, Momentum 4, QC Ultra, Airpods Max), competes with or beats many wired closed backs. I think they fall just short of Audeze Maxwell with some EQ adjustments, but those headphones are very close to my tastes out of the box so YMMV.\n* Pairs great tuning with anatomy measurements to normalize low end performance between different users and re-seating.\n* **PEQ** to dial in to your tastes\n* **Low latency** (matched my monitor's input lag near identically in gaming mode by my perception))and high res Bluetooth connections with the dongle. I think Sennheiser are getting close to or even beating that 30ms latency in the low latency dongle mode\n* **The sound with the dongle is excellent**, even in the low latency mode\n* Solid all around functionality as a portable ANC headphone\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n* **Comfort is not great**. Fairly shallow pads that compress easily cause heat and pressure on the pinna, and I don't have big ears. They (and Momentum 4) also have an odd cup angle that requires you to rotate the headband forward which is sub-optimal. For comparison, I find the Bathys comfier in the pads but slightly less comfy in the headband. I hate the XM5/XM6 comfort-wise, 630 are an improvement. APM are comfier and QC Ultra are much much comfier.\n* The WC Freeze pads for Momentum 4 fit and are way comfier but hurt the seal a lot (which makes ANC and sound both much worse) making those pads a complete no-go IMO.\n* No 2.4GHz on the dongle\n* Finicky pairing and touch controls. Same issues as Momentum 4.\n* **No ability to use the mic + get full sound quality at the same time**\n* No options for a boom mic\n* **Boring looking and no color options,** and they are a bit too thick in the cups to look normal vs other ANC.\n* **Expensive**: **You can get a pair of Momentum 4 + an Audeze Maxwell for $50 more**, and less than the price of the HDB 630 if you are willing to do refurbs/open box. Maxwell is comfier to me (weight doesn't bother me, capra strap improves even more) and sounds better + has the boom mic and low latency via 2.4ghz. Momentum 4 sounds pretty good with the built in graphic EQ and not that much worse than HDB 630 if you use another app for PEQ.\n\n**Deeper Sound Breakdown**: These headphones were very quickly determined to be not worth the money for me, so these impressions are not my most thorough. As with all sound impressions, YMMV.\n\n* **Tuning**\n   * They are **a bit mid-bass focused** for me, sounding a bit bloated in the low end. Luckily the blending into the mids is very clean and not boomy. The extension is good, but the midbass focus also reduces how apparent this is\n   * **The mids are very nice.** Perhaps a bit lacking in energy, but this can be fixed with a peak filter most likely somewhere between 1-3k. I often find 2-2.5k helps with this a lot.\n   * **They are very natural sounding in timbre**. This is the one thing that they solidly beat the Momentum 4 at even with the M4 dialed in with the in-app EQ.\n   * **The treble very even and pleasant albeit** maybe a tad too relaxed for me.\n* **Technicalities**\n   * **Bass texture is lacking.** Even with a filter reigning in the midbass, they lacked the grit and texture in the low-end that I really look for in a headphone\n   * **Treble is a bit oversmoothed, leading to a perceived lack of resolution**. This may actually be affecting the bass texture situation.\n   * **They aren't that punchy or energetic**. The midbass focus and a bit of relaxed 1-3k lead to a bit of dullness. Kick drums don't impact as nicely as I'd like, and higher voices don't come through as strongly as I think they should.\n   * **They are a well-controlled but not super 'fast'.** Especially with the bass reduced, they do give the impression of not being sloppy or slow, but they aren't super quick in terms of attack or decay.\n   * **A note about imaging/soundstage**: I am a speaker guy first and foremost. I don't get any impression of verticality or layering from any headphones unless the music is mastered specifically with headphones and spaciousness in mind. I find that production to be very rare. The things I do notice are imaging and distance. **The imaging is good; t**his is mostly just down to consistent channel matching across the FR. **Spaciousness is exactly what you'd expect.** They aren't completely inside my head, but they give no impression the sound is coming from a distance outside of the headphone. This is typical for me for closed backs.\n* **EQ Suggestions:**\n   * Peak filter around 120hz, q\\~1, -1-3db to get rid of the bass bloat\n   * If you are more of a bass roll-off fan, do a bass shelf with 2-5db reduction.\n   * Find the area between 1-3k that increasing with a q filter of \\~1 by 1-3db gives you more energy and punch.\n   * Find any over-emphasis in the low treble, 3-7k and reduce that if needed.\n   * See if you have any aggressive peaks above 5k, and reduce them with smaller q value filters\n   * Add a treble shelf to boost detail if needed.\n\n**Summary:** excellent sound especially with PEQ, mediocre comfort, boring design that looks a bit bulky on head, good latency and sound via dongle, no boom mic, sound is bad when using mic, and pricey vs a dedicated ANC + dedicated gaming headphone. I like the Maxwell + Momentum 4 enough to make it a no-go for me. **But if the mic situation and comfort are good for you, they're very hard to beat as an all-around single solution.**",

    "selftext": "So all the negative press the Jlab Epic Lux Lab Edition received has been rectified with the firmware updates? Also, if anyone has experience with both these and the Epic Lab Edition TWS, how do they compare/how does the Jlab Signature sound profile for each compare? Thank you.\n\nI am someone who was originally aiming towards the Creative Aurvana Ace 3s, but love the sound profile of the Jlabs too much (I use the Knowles Sound Profile with a bump in the bass) and thought why not upgrade to the headphones instead of the TWS to compensate for the difference in soundstage and generational gap as the Epic Lab Edition TWS are a few years dated now compared to the Creatives.",

    "selftext": "Listening to them as I write this. Technically a fist impression but like I know what I'm listening for and done all my test songs so I feel confident on how I feel. They sound great, shocker right. The big thing is music just sounds correct in these. Good bass extension so still fun. Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other — everything has its space.\n\nHaven’t played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it’s nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony’s level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it’s impressive how well the ANC works — definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn’t.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn’t quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it’s not far behind — way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts — 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I’d still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I’m really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic — clean, balanced, natural — and they’re super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic — super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality’s surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

    "selftext": "I am a regular music listener and always use my headphones to do so, however using them for a long time builds up a lot of earwax which often completely shuts off my ear after waking up. The mesh around it too get earwax on them, needing to clean them every few days.  \nIt's just become a regular routine for me to clean off my earwax atleast once a day to avoid getting my ears shut off due to the wax. Was not too confident with hydrogen peroxide, so got an ear camera cleaning tool by bebird, and honestly it is quite good to use.  \nThe scoop is silicone based so i dont feel much sceptical about it to not put in my ear... However for my headphones i dont have any solution to the wax which gets stuck on the mesh, even after trying to get it off by toothpick and small objects it just stays there. Removing it would obviously damage the pre glued seal which would have to be reapplied then. Any suggestions for removing the earwax from the mesh of the headphone..?",

The midrange is a little forward, and the treble has some peaks that I am very certain is down to the resin chamber.\n\nThis is purely a for fun project, not final as I plan to do stamped metal as the actual chamber for my closed back.

    "selftext": "That cord always ends up tangled in my pocket, a tiny knot of chaos I have to spend minutes undoing. My clumsy fingers wrestle with the plastic wire, while people with wireless earbuds would’ve already finished two songs by now. It’s been too long—its rubber coating has started to get sticky, the volume button on the controller feels jammed, and sometimes there’s a faint electric buzz in the right ear. Maybe it’s time to replace it.\n\nBut I just can’t quit that little click when I plug it into my phone.\nSo soft, yet so solid.\nLike the sound of an old door lock turning, shutting the whole world out.\n\nWalking is the worst. The wire swings across my chest, rustling against my jacket’s zipper. On the stairs I have to hold it tight, or it’ll catch on the railing. Windy days are even worse—the wire tangles in my hair and pulls hard enough to hurt. I still remember that rainy day when my best friend and I huddled under the convenience store awning. She naturally took off her right earbud and handed it to me:\n“Listen—this intro is amazing.”\nA raindrop slid down the wire into my collar, cold and sharp. We stood together in that shared ninety centimeters of space, and the warmth of her body seemed to flow through the copper line. For a moment, the rain really did feel like decoration.\n\nNow my friend wears thousand-yuan noise-cancelling headphones, walking with confidence, never worrying about tangled cords. She says technology is great—it’s freed us from the wire.\nBut I’m still using this glitchy old pair, the left side fine, the right side buzzing now and then—only working if I hold it at just the right angle. Like me, struggling in that night without an ending—broken, stuttering, unclear.\n\nYesterday on my way to class, the wire snagged on my backpack strap again. I crouched to untie the knot while the person behind me clicked their tongue in annoyance. But honestly, I kind of enjoy this clumsiness. Wireless feels too perfect—perfect like a lie. The spotless charging case, the precise touch controls, never tangled, never messy. But my life is a tangle—why should my music be perfectly ordered?\n\nThis wired earphone has been with me for nearly three years. The braided cable is pilling, the gold plating on the plug worn thin. These flaws are like folded corners in an old diary, recording every ordinary day. Of course a new pair would be better—sleek and shiny—but it doesn’t know my ears. It hasn’t heard the song I played on repeat after you left during that fight. It doesn’t know the white noise that lulled me to sleep on sleepless nights.\n\nLast month I almost replaced it. I even placed the order for the newest model—then canceled it at 3 a.m. The customer service agent asked if there was a problem with the product.\n“No,” I said. “The problem’s with me.”\n—Nostalgia is a sickness with no cure.\n\nToday, as the taxi climbed the overpass, the right ear suddenly went silent. I instinctively twisted the yellowed plug, feeling the rough edge of the tape under my fingers. The river below flowed calmly, and in my left ear Eason Chan was singing:\n‘The water knows well—it’s my duty to cherish the flowers.’\nThe music sounded thin, like a bird that had lost one wing.\nAnd still, I never replaced these earphones.\n\nThe right one is dead now. So be it. One side is enough.\nThis worn-out cord I clung to—\nin the end, it couldn’t keep the two worlds playing in sync.",

At first, I was slightly afraid they were fakes, but after listening, I am fairly sure they are the real deal.\n\nTheir value is STRONG. The cable is braided below the Y-split. Makes them appear a bit more refined, I guess. These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

Burson Conductor Voyager Max DAC/AMP  \n3. ModHouse Tungsten DS V1\n\n \n\nI had a lot of headphones before like Mezes Empy II or Elite, DCAs Expanse, ZMFs Atrium and Verite open, Finals D8000 Pro and Hifimans HE1000 Stealth. After all of them I can say after one moth I own the Tungsten, the Tungsten is the clear winner for me.\n\nBase is such punchy and crisp at the same time and goes so crazy deep. Holy smokes. Its also wonderful layered.\n\nMids are present but not so much in your face as Finals D8000 Pro. Its more like the HE1000 Stealth.\n\nTreble is smooth and not fatiguing overall. It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

    "selftext": "Mini-Rant: I have now purchased 4 different headphones ranging from $20-$80. All of them have this annoying amount of mid-bass added to them that practically acts as a vibrator on your head. All of them did not say anywhere on the box, \"bass-boosted\".\n\nRant over.\n\nBefore people say, \"Just use a live equalizer\". I do, and it results in my audio randomly skipping on my PC every 5-10 seconds or so, no matter the bandwidth. As a musician, that is very annoying.\n\nOn a more serious discussion, why do manufacturers feel the need to do this? Like I understand if your product is labeled, \"bass-boosted\". I've used plenty of other people's expensive headphones, and even they have this issue.\n\nEDIT: Type of headphones because I forgot like dumb, dumb. Something with aux and amp connections, that's it. ",

    "selftext": "DO NOT RECOMMEND OR PURCHASE!!\n\nThe Heavys H1H headphones, marketed for metal fans with an eight-driver design, promised durability and premium sound for $485. Instead, they delivered a flimsy build, muddy audio, and abysmal customer service, making this purchase a complete letdown.\nDurability: Shockingly Fragile\nThe website claims the H1H survived 1.8m drops onto hard floors, but this is a blatant lie. My headphones’ headband snapped in two after a mere 0.4m drop onto a soft carpeted floor. For a premium product, this fragility is outrageous. The 308g weight also made them uncomfortable for extended wear, and the satin finish attracted fingerprints, further cheapening the experience.\n\nCustomer Service: Insulting Response,\n\nWhen I contacted Heavys about the broken headband, their response was slow and unhelpful. After days of generic emails, they offered a 25% discount on another purchase. Why would I buy a faulty product again? This dismissive attitude left me feeling cheated and ignored.\n\nSound and Features: Substandard,\n\nThe sound was bass-heavy and muddy, burying vocals and guitars in tracks like Iron Maiden’s Run to the Hills. The app’s EQ barely helped, and the soundstage felt cramped. The “Hell Blocker” noise cancellation was ineffective against basic background noise, and clunky buttons made adjustments a hassle.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Heavys H1H are a massive disappointment. A fragile build, false durability claims, poor sound, and insulting customer service make these headphones a waste of money. Metal fans, steer clear and invest in something reliable.",

Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better.

Especially the high-quality bass. But one thing that made me really happy as a customer is the accessories you get. When I bought much more expensive headphones, they don't treat you as good as FiiO. You get the regular 3.5mm cable with 6.35mm adapter but also a premium looking case and A BALANCED 4.4MM CABLE! Amazing headphones with amazing accessories. all for an amazing price. It's super convenient because I always wanted a balanced cable for my HD 600 and Edition XS but they are quite expensive. The fact that FiiO included them is just really nice. Now I can use them for my Edition XS without having to go out and look and spend money on them.\n\nThis really reminds me of how cheap smartphones gives you more than $1000 smartphones. You get a screen protector already applied, a free phone case included in the box and of course a should-be-mandatory charging brick. But for $1000 you don't even get a charger, like how is a dude gonna charge the damn phone???",

I know that it wasn’t there before, because my mom did a very good job of making sure I had a good head shape when I was an infant. I also had a thing where I’d just have my hands in my hair.

    "title": "3 year Review of the Audeze LCD-X (Post 2021 Version)",
    "selftext": "To start off, these are such incredible cans. It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

I’m About to make a job change to wfh and decided last week I’d get myself a Christmas present of noise cancellation, over the ear headphone to reduce those outside distractions while I’m trying to concentrate and focus. \n\n4 or 7 years or so ago the wife and I were goofing in a mall and visiting a crowded Apple Store for some reason. We live in a rural area and it’s two hours to the nearest so it’s a novel event and we wandered around checking out everything . Outside of some Bose about 15+ years ago, I’ve never had occasion to be near NC Headphones. \n\nAnyway, I popped these on and EVERYTHING went dead silent. Best of all, my wife’s voice, right in front of my face trying to talk to me. Reminded me of that scene in, I think, Face Off with travolta and cage where someone drops headphones of soothing music on the little 4 yr old kid and then a huge gun battle breaks out. In that crazy, crowded, noisy store I heard nothing but soft cool jazz. I could see my wife’s lips moving but could hear a word and it was pure bliss. Not sure which model I had but they were like $500+ at the time. \n\nQ: Anything BETTER, or cheaper yet still super isolating and effective these days? How would I go about trying other models out? \n\nAlso appreciate advice on replacing ear pads, battery life, overall longevity of devices. ",

Are there any other considerations that should be taken into account?\n\nObviously some of these are very well-produced, i.e. the first half or so, but I'd still like your input, especially on the rest.\n\n* Christ Jones - Long After You're Gone\n* Alan Taylor - Colour to the Moon\n* Boz Scaggs - Thanks to You\n* Dominique Fils-Aimé - Birds\n* Dave Brubeck - Take Five\n* Dave Brubeck - Far More Drums\n* Whiplash soundtrack - Caravan\n* Patricia Barber - Yellow Car III\n* Patricia Barber - Nardis\n* Club Boogaloo - The Yellow Theme\n* Tom Waits - Step Right Up\n* Amy Irving - Why Don't You Do Right (having extreme difficulty finding this one)\n* Michael Jackson - Billie Jean\n* Madonna - Vogue (from the Immaculate Collection, \"QSound\" encoded. Unsure about this, as the effect doesn't translate well to headphones)\n* Stevie Wonder - Superstitious\n* Fleetwood Mac - The Chain\n* Billy Joel - Piano Man\n* The Philosopher Kings - You Don't Love Me\n* Rammstein - Deutschland\n* Radiohead - Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box\n* Tool - Pneuma\n\nSome of you will certainly disagree with at least some (or perhaps even all) of my choices for subjective reasons (i.e. you don't like the song) and that's fine, but I'm not looking for those opinions. Also, in an ironic twist of hypocrisy, please do not recommend anything under the electronic genre, rap, country, classical, or any live recordings (I do not enjoy hearing crowds with my music).\n\nEdit: Also, do not recommend any streaming services. Not going to happen, not now, not ever, for so many reasons.",

I found these HiFi For All stands (pictured) which are affordable, and solve the problem, but I would prefer one with a bit of a longer headband area (vs just wide depth-wise). Like the ones on Gadgetry’s vids - there is one that has a little knob that looks like it is for length adjustment that looks nice too, but I can’t find it on the net. (Third picture, from his Aune AR5000 review, sorry for blurriness).\n\nI am thinking there must be some hidden gems out there that are reasonable affordable, and available in the US sans tariff/import fees, preferably.",

For example jumping out the plane in warzone the wind and engine sounded like it was actually up in your face if that makes sense, but with the Maxwells it just sounds thinned out.

I would expect more at this price. honestly feels a bit plasticky and cheap. style also is very bland. doesn't look premium. Also, I personally don't like the swipe touch controls and I found them finicky.\n\nPX7 S3 - excellent. no leather. great styling and premium look. I enjoy the button controls better than the Sennheiser.\n\nPx8 S2 - excellent. has leather if you're concern about that. great styling and premium look even more than the px7. same button controls as the px7.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nHDB 630 - good but not great. with airplane noise it's about the same as the Px7. 630's were better with distinct noises like voices or background noise in a cafe or on a bus.\n\nPX7 S3 - good. not great. pretty good with airplane noise but distinct noises leak through quite a bit.\n\nPx8 S2 - just okay. worst of the bunch surprisingly. let in more airplane noise than the other two and distinct sounds leaked through quite a bit like the Px7\n\n**SQ:**\n\n**HDB 630:**\n\ntuning: pretty neutral\n\nspace and technicalities: space and staging is good. not great but all three are closed back so that's a natural limitation. Sennheiser is more relaxed and less \"fun\" but some audiophiles prefer that. both the Px7 and Px8 everything sounds closer and more \"fun\". good technicalities though. everything feels snappy and controlled. instrument separation is great.\n\nbass: well extended into sub bass and well controlled but is definitely not the star of the show. a bit thin sounding if you're not used to audiophile tuning. they can rumble though if you boost the bass with the EQ\n\nmids: maybe it's the audiophile tuning but it sounds a bit shouty to me. definitely not warm. lower mids seems thin while upper mids sound too forward. vocals sound a bit thin and snares sound a little sharp. actually a bit annoying to my ears but I tend to be treble sensitive.\n\ntreble: great as you would suspect from audiophile tuning. well extended and controlled but do weirdly get harsh for me. again, I'm a bit sensitive to treble so YMMV with that.\n\n**PX7 S3:**\n\ntuning: very bloated bass. maybe you'll like it if you're a basshead. good extension into sub bass but a bit less controlled than the px8 and 630 but still pretty good.\n\nspace and technicalities: worst of the bunch but still pretty good and pleasant to the ears. I only really notice they're worse after listening to the other headphones. both the px8 and 630 extract more detail and sound more spacious and 3D.\n\nbass: way bloated. strong and good extension into sub bass\n\nmids: my favorite here actually. sounds intimate and full. smooth and fun tuning. not shouty.\n\ntreble: my favorite also. sounds well extended and airy but not overly so. doesn't get sharp or shouty. maybe a tad rolled off and recessed compared to true audiophile tuning but to my ear they are close to just right. very pleasant sounding. the treble adds a bit of nice air and sparkle without getting annoying.\n\n**Px8 S2:**\n\ntuning: I would still consider these bass bloated but less so than the px7. mids feel a tiny bit more recessed than the px7 but more present and forward than the 630. more treble presence than the px7. maybe about the same as the 630 but sounds less shouty.\n\nspace and technicalities: very good here. better 3D space and detail than the px7. bass is tighter and transients feels slightly snappier than the px7. similar to the 630 in terms of space and detail but again, the B&Ws feel closer and more \"fun\".\n\nbass: my favorite bass of the three. still sounds bloated to me but less so than the px7. more balanced and controlled than the px7. definitely way more power here than the 630 without EQing.\n\nmids: very good. tiny bit recessed compared to the px7. sounds smooth and balanced.\n\ntreble: very good here. well controlled and extended but still sounds smooth. about the same presence as the 630 but sounds more balanced to me.\n\n**what I'm keeping?**\n\nto my surprise, I think I'm keeping the Px7 S3. I'm hoping the band loosens a bit. the ANC is pretty good especially with airplane noise. the B&W styling is very attractive. mids and highs are great and tuned to my liking. sense of space and technicalities are still very good and pleasant to listen to. and for now, I have the low bass down 3.5 and mid bass down 2.0 and they sound less bloated.",

You can feel the wider sound stage or I should say the distance the pads created the second you put them on.\n\nLess bass but just right, stock bass was too much for me. Sub bass doesn’t seem to be impacted much.\n\nBetter mids IMO. more separation, details.\n\nTreble is definitely more, airy but not really harsh to me so far.\n\nFeels like the tuning is now neutral bright like IEMs but still has good amount of bass.

Awesome bass + sub bass (FT1 pro is better), droolworthy soundstage/imaging.\n\nI cannot believe the things I am hearing in music and while playing BF6, I can pinpoint instruments and gunshots in any direction like I'm right there. All of this and no Beyer sibilance? absolutely brilliant.\n\nThese headphones are damn near perfect for my use case while being sensitive to higher frequencies. If you dont take lightly to bright headphones give these a try!\n\n",

Out of the box yes but with EQ bass shelf on 6xx it gets much closer. They complement them well. 6xx is more of an intimate sound, XV is more spacious.\n\nKick drums and high hat sound perfect IMO. Love it\n\nOne weird thing I noticed....I always run through freq sweeps and tone generators every once in awhile to make sure there is no driver buzzing or other weird stuff going on.\n\nWith these Edition XV, there is no driver buzzing. However, when running the tone generator on squig.link I notice there is a tone within the tone at various frequencies. Not sure what that's about.\n\n300hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n1700hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n4000hz - left channel there are two seperate freqs coming through\n\n4900hz - right channel tone issue\n\nWould I have ever noticed just listening to music and watching videos?

Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better. I was listening to my go to testing track Dreams by Fleetwood Mac and song just felt livelier. Stevie Nicks' voice had more character, the kick drums had presence and everything felt musical. The treble is spicy, but in not treble sensitive and actually prefer (call me crazy). The sound stage is bigger too!\n\nI am using these with my Ifi Neo Idsd that using the Burr Brown for reference and power these with ease. \n\nMy edition XS has been great for the last 3 years, but it's time to retire/sell them. I'll be listening to the Aryas and Fiio FT1 from now on, so they don't have any use. \n\nIn conclusion, these are brilliant and very happy I finally pulled the trigger.

I definitely think they're a little boomy without an EQ so any help would be appreciated.",

Especially the high-quality bass. But one thing that made me really happy as a customer is the accessories you get. When I bought much more expensive headphones, they don't treat you as good as FiiO. You get the regular 3.5mm cable with 6.35mm adapter but also a premium looking case and A BALANCED 4.4MM CABLE! Amazing headphones with amazing accessories. all for an amazing price. It's super convenient because I always wanted a balanced cable for my HD 600 and Edition XS but they are quite expensive. The fact that FiiO included them is just really nice. Now I can use them for my Edition XS without having to go out and look and spend money on them.\n\nThis really reminds me of how cheap smartphones gives you more than $1000 smartphones. You get a screen protector already applied, a free phone case included in the box and of course a should-be-mandatory charging brick. But for $1000 you don't even get a charger, like how is a dude gonna charge the damn phone???",

I have this dent, and although I haven’t worn my over-ears in more than a week, it doesn’t seem to be going away. I am still fairly young, and was young when I started wearing my headphones. I am very worried because I’m already insecure and I don’t want to worry about being even more ugly because I messed up my head because I like music. Is there any way to fix this or does it go away? I know that it wasn’t there before, because my mom did a very good job of making sure I had a good head shape when I was an infant. I also had a thing where I’d just have my hands in my hair. I never felt this dent till recently, and I am very scared. Sorry if this is long, or annoying, or not very fluent. I speak english fine, I just struggle writing it out.\n\nTLDR; Is the headphone dent permanent/can I fix it?",

    "selftext": "Hello! I understand this is a very, VERY niche situation, but I believe it would be important to share, since there's very few articles about this out there.\n\nSo, I'm making this post as a warning and a guide for how to recover from a \"bricked\" system, after enrolling keys and enabling secure boot through sbctl in Arch Linux ( this locks you out of SteamOS, and any other OSes not signed by your secure boot keys :) )\n\nI just went through a roller coaster of emotions because I hadn't done enough research, went fiddling around with the system, and found out way too late that there's no way to disable secure boot in the SD's BIOS.\n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, here are the steps to remove the enrolled keys from the system, even if you didn't sign any files before rebooting (don't ask how I managed that):\n\n\nYou will need the following packages:\n\n- sbctl\n\n- efitools\n\n- mokutil\n\n\nIf no system files were signed:\n\n- Take the drive with your OS, and mount it to another computer;\n\n- Disable secure boot in the second device, and boot;\n\n- Sign the necessary files (using \"sudo sbctl verify\", then \"sudo sbctl sign -s <file>\").\n\n\nIf system files are signed:\n\n- Boot into your OS on your Steam Deck;\n\n- Find the \"PK.key\", \"KEK.key\" and \"db.key\" files that were created with \"sbctl create-keys\" (I used the command: sudo find / -type f -name \"*.key\");\n\n- Use the commands \"mokutil --pk\", \"mokutil --kek\" and \"mokutil --db\" to see the keys that are still enrolled into the system;\n\n- And the following commands to delete each key, one by one (you might have to run some of these multiple times, to account for the multiple keys):\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/PK.key PK\",\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/KEK.key KEK\", and\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/db.key db\"\n\nAfter there are no more keys showing up when the mokutil commands are ran, you should be able to use \"sbctl status\", and see that there are no \"vendor keys\"; Now you can reboot your system, and secure boot should be disabled! Yay!\n\nI combined these steps from these two great guides, thank you very much to the authors:\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Assisted_process_with_sbctl\n\nhttps://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SecureBootForSteamDeck",

It's a bit annoying to have to tinker with it every time I wanna swap between docked and handheld modes... \n\nAre there any mods or tweaks to make couch co-op a little easier when it comes to controller connections??

    "title": "Another Thread on SD OLED WiFi Issues",
    "selftext": "I have had my Steam Deck OLED for several weeks now, and have made a bunch of changes to it like a 2TB SSD and hall effect sticks and what not. I even built a headless server (Ryzen 7 5800XT, RX 9060 XT 16GB) running Windows 11 specifically for streaming my Windows-only titles (like Battlefield 6) to my Deck. For a while I was just using Steam Remote Play (with all the settings configured according to other threads for the most reliable performance), but frequent gamescope crashes/freezes led me to try Sunshine/Moonlight. Lately I have been using this (along with MoonDeck and MoonDeck Buddy) and have had good results, **when it works**.\n\nFor additional context, I have a pretty high-end home networking setup consisting of all Ubiquiti hardware, and very dense AP coverage (I have a lot of ESP-based IoT devices on a separate SSID). I have a 2.5Gb symmetrical fiber ISP (irrelevant to local streaming but figured I would mention), UCG Fiber gateway/NVR, USW Pro XG 8 PoE 10Gb core switch, USW Flex 2.5g PoE secondary switch, two U7 Pro XGS APs, two U7 In-Wall APs, one U6+ AP and some other PoE switches, etc. etc. The streaming server is on GbE, and I have a highly configured wireless environment with fine-tuned radio transmit power on each AP, minimum RSSI set, etc.\n\nAll that to say, my home network is NOT the issue here, and I have narrowed it down to the WiFi chipset on the Deck being the problem. I have read about these issues and try pretty much every fix there is, but there are just constant issues with the WiFi - dropped packets, disconnects, weird power state issues (even after disabling WiFi power management in the developer settings), and overall just an unplayable streaming experience once the issues start. Sometimes it works without issue, even for several hours, sometimes I cannot even get into a match before it starts stuttering or something crashes. It even frequently causes driver hangs on the host machine because of the connection issues on the Deck.\n\nConversely, using the Moonlight client on my Mac mini (on a 10GbE wired connection), the stream is flawless and rock solid stable even on the longest streaming sessions.\n\nI am wondering if there is any workaround to the frankly unacceptable WiFi issues? Is there a hardware mod to replace the chipset with something better? Third party kernel with different WiFi drivers (or different drivers in general)? Does the SteamOS beta channel have different drivers that solve all these problems? Also, I have tried forcing the WPA supplicant backend, but this just breaks streaming altogether (black screen and choppy audio, Remote Play just flat out refuses to start), so I wasn't able to test stability with the different backend.\n\nI know Valve is 'aware' of the issue, but given that the OLED has been out this long and there still isn't an official fix, I'm at the point of going really far into a rabbit hole to fix it myself. Wondering if anyone in the SD community has come up with a solution.",

This is not a consistent problem, as games like Abiotic Factor are able to be played just fine with keyboard and mouse, but certain games don't have the built-in functions to receive keyboard and mouse inputs instead of Steam Deck inputs. I've looked all over online and have found no real way to fix this, even trying to boot up games with various versions of Proton.

While this works near perfectly in desktop mode, keeping largely to 30/60 of the four hours I've tried it, Game Mode seems to override this switch. Causing the problem most people experience where the game dips into the 40s instead with plenty of slowdown. I'm not sure how to fix this.\n\nthat's all I've got right now.",

IT did randomly decide to work for a couple minutes after sitting for a while but then I dropped my controller and it unplugged and it proceeded to cause all of the issues all over again. Im guessing it has to do with my dock because there are no problems at all in handheld mode. If anyone has any experience with these kinds of issues and has a fix so that I dont have to go as far as laying down on the road outside, that would be appreciated. \n\nUpdate: it is now even worse as I cannot even get the buggy twitchy screen to show up and now I only have black screen when docked.",

    "selftext": "So I've been playing metroidvanias pretty much nonstop since I got back into them a couple years ago. I've realized that I'm woefully inexperienced on the \"classics\" of the genre; namely, Metroid and Castlevania games. I've only played one of each: Metroid Dread and Castlevania: SotN.\n\nAfter doing some research I've narrowed down my list of games I \"aught\" to play down to 5 from each series (actually, 5 +3 for Castlevania, since it was unclear the quality of those last 3). I'll post the games list at the end. Given the wide swath of consoles these games come from (SNES, GBA, GC, 3DS, DS, PS1, TG16), my question is: what is the best way to play them?\n\nI've also noticed the huge spike in retro handhelds being advertised on social media that come with emulators and tons of games preinstalled. I'm not opposed to buying a device dedicated for this, just for the pure simplicity of just buying it and I'm ready to play. There are a lot out there now. Is there one that you guys think would be best suited for my needs? Is there a 3rd party that sells a version of it with these games on it?\n\nI also have a Switch and Steam Deck. I'm not opposed to buying the games for the switch, though I don't really use it much anymore. The Steam Deck seems like the best solution since (1) I assume it's the most powerful of the three options and (2) I regularly use it for my other portable gaming. Would it be really painful to get all these games working well on the SD? I'm not opposed to putting in the work, but I can see myself spending tons of time getting everything set up, only so not every actually play the, (Skyrim modding anyone). I started looking into it and the sheer number of emulators and options and such seemed a bit... daunting.\n\nTLDR; What's the best way to play the older Metroid and Castlevania games these days?\n\n \n\nSuper Metroid (Super Nintendo, 1994)\n\nMetroid: Fusion (GBA, 2002)\n\nMetroid: Zero Mission (GBA, 2004)\n\nMetroid Prime (GameCube, 2002)\n\nMetroid: Samus Returns (3DS, 2017)\n\nSuper Castlevania IV (SNES, 1992)\n\nCastlevania: Symphony of the Night (PS1, 1997)\n\nCastlevania: Aria of Sorrow (GBA, 2003)\n\nCastlevania: Dawn of Sorrow (DS, 2005)\n\nCastlevania: Order of Ecclesia (DS, 2009)\n\n  \n\\-----Castlevania Maybes-----\n\nCastlevania: Rondo of Blood (TG16, 1993)\n\nCastlevania: Circle of the Moon (GBA, 2001)\n\nCastlevania: Portrait of Ruin (DS, 2006)",

Trying to config most console one by one but I got some problem with the 3ds one and haven't been able to find a solution.\n\nI have some really bad stutter, it's unplayable. I tried to set vulkan for the API and enabled Async shader compilation, even tried to set the internal resolution to the lowest but still a mess.\n\nFor reference I'm using the azahar emulator that's already within emudeck, I have seen some people using citra and something else, are those better? I didn't see them in emudeck though.\n\nI also launch my game through desktop with the es-de emulator, haven't really understood how to properly set this up through steam, imo I don't mind but would that boost the performances to launch the emulate game from steam directly? Yea sorry I'm also still kind of new to the steam deck too lol\n\nThanks",

Selfishly I love gaming and I want to be able to still play a few hours a day , and I know I’ll be having sleepless nights, and probably no access to the main TV!\n\nI won’t be playing online games on my steam deck , it’ll be single player games. \nI have a ps5 so I was hoping to cast it using the Chiaki thing (I’ve done some research )\n\nSo my question is - what is the resolution and latency like if I cast from my ps5? I don’t want it to look washed out or to have ridiculous lag that I can’t enjoy it .  Does it run smooth? Are the OLED colours looking vibrant ? Could I still get a good framed per second on a game such as… Ghost of Yotei if I cast from my ps5? Or is it because the steam deck couldn’t run it if I purchased it from steam then I also couldn’t cast it with a good frame rate?\n\nHonestly that’s my last hurdle before I buy one!!\n\nThanks in advance \n\n",

I set up controls in the controller settings so that holding r5 is alt+tab and double tapping the menu button is windows specifically for helldivers. However it doesn't work, I get the haptic feedback but nothing else happens. I'm also having an issue where the trackpad doesn't work in the overlay mode while on a game. Both of these issues are fixed if I attach a mouse and keyboard via the dock, but I'm wanting to play this handheld. I have already tried a few things, like trying different bindings, running steam as administrator and messing around with the controller settings.\n\nDoes anyone know a solution to these issues? ",

Death Stranding and Cyberpunk 2077 are what i'm looking at the most. I know that both games don't run perfect, but a lot of people praise them on the Deck. \n\nWhat game is a better experience? In terms of stability, battery, fan noise, graphical fidelity, and compatibility with Lossless Scaling? \n\nI can adjust to minor lag spikes, as long as they're in isolated scenes or areas and don't occur regularly in the game world.",

In trying to get them on, I kind of “twisted” the actual steam left joystick and it became incredibly stiff. I was convinced I had to return to valve. I then gently rotated it the other way and it worked again. If I touch the joystick, it just seems to wobble in a way the right doesn’t. It doesn’t seem to affect gameplay in any noticeable way, but it doesn’t make a slightly different sound when I touch the stick as opposed to the right. Has this happened to anyone else?\n",

Works normally even on sleep mode and gameplay. But of course, slow charging.\n\n- resetted the EC Controller I believe. The thing where yung press and hold the volume up and the power button when turned off and then after the light blinks, connect charger. Result: Still not working correctly\n\n\n- completely shutting down > connects charger to work > boots up  while charging > reconnect charger. Result: It doesnt charge anymore when I reconnect the charger.\n\n\nI don't know if there is an issue with power delivery controller or what. Or an issue with the charging port now.\n\nAppreciate any tips or advice. Thank u",

    "selftext": "Hello! I understand this is a very, VERY niche situation, but I believe it would be important to share, since there's very few articles about this out there.\n\nSo, I'm making this post as a warning and a guide for how to recover from a \"bricked\" system, after enrolling keys and enabling secure boot through sbctl in Arch Linux ( this locks you out of SteamOS, and any other OSes not signed by your secure boot keys :) )\n\nI just went through a roller coaster of emotions because I hadn't done enough research, went fiddling around with the system, and found out way too late that there's no way to disable secure boot in the SD's BIOS.\n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, here are the steps to remove the enrolled keys from the system, even if you didn't sign any files before rebooting (don't ask how I managed that):\n\n\nYou will need the following packages:\n\n- sbctl\n\n- efitools\n\n- mokutil\n\n\nIf no system files were signed:\n\n- Take the drive with your OS, and mount it to another computer;\n\n- Disable secure boot in the second device, and boot;\n\n- Sign the necessary files (using \"sudo sbctl verify\", then \"sudo sbctl sign -s <file>\").\n\n\nIf system files are signed:\n\n- Boot into your OS on your Steam Deck;\n\n- Find the \"PK.key\", \"KEK.key\" and \"db.key\" files that were created with \"sbctl create-keys\" (I used the command: sudo find / -type f -name \"*.key\");\n\n- Use the commands \"mokutil --pk\", \"mokutil --kek\" and \"mokutil --db\" to see the keys that are still enrolled into the system;\n\n- And the following commands to delete each key, one by one (you might have to run some of these multiple times, to account for the multiple keys):\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/PK.key PK\",\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/KEK.key KEK\", and\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/db.key db\"\n\nAfter there are no more keys showing up when the mokutil commands are ran, you should be able to use \"sbctl status\", and see that there are no \"vendor keys\"; Now you can reboot your system, and secure boot should be disabled! Yay!\n\nI combined these steps from these two great guides, thank you very much to the authors:\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Assisted_process_with_sbctl\n\nhttps://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SecureBootForSteamDeck",

This is not a consistent problem, as games like Abiotic Factor are able to be played just fine with keyboard and mouse, but certain games don't have the built-in functions to receive keyboard and mouse inputs instead of Steam Deck inputs. I've looked all over online and have found no real way to fix this, even trying to boot up games with various versions of Proton.

    "selftext": "Hi, ive been a steamdeck user for close to two years so I know this thing has its quirks. Last week ive started experiencing a problem where my screen is choppy, has lines and randomly black screens upon being docked and running on my monitor for a few seconds over and over again. Ive tried using developer options to change the channel to main to fix, no dice, ive gone into the konsole and reset some resolution properties, nada, changed monitors, changed to a tv, unplugged everything and nothing seems to work. IT did randomly decide to work for a couple minutes after sitting for a while but then I dropped my controller and it unplugged and it proceeded to cause all of the issues all over again. Im guessing it has to do with my dock because there are no problems at all in handheld mode. If anyone has any experience with these kinds of issues and has a fix so that I dont have to go as far as laying down on the road outside, that would be appreciated. \n\nUpdate: it is now even worse as I cannot even get the buggy twitchy screen to show up and now I only have black screen when docked.",

    "selftext": "Hello! I understand this is a very, VERY niche situation, but I believe it would be important to share, since there's very few articles about this out there.\n\nSo, I'm making this post as a warning and a guide for how to recover from a \"bricked\" system, after enrolling keys and enabling secure boot through sbctl in Arch Linux ( this locks you out of SteamOS, and any other OSes not signed by your secure boot keys :) )\n\nI just went through a roller coaster of emotions because I hadn't done enough research, went fiddling around with the system, and found out way too late that there's no way to disable secure boot in the SD's BIOS.\n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, here are the steps to remove the enrolled keys from the system, even if you didn't sign any files before rebooting (don't ask how I managed that):\n\n\nYou will need the following packages:\n\n- sbctl\n\n- efitools\n\n- mokutil\n\n\nIf no system files were signed:\n\n- Take the drive with your OS, and mount it to another computer;\n\n- Disable secure boot in the second device, and boot;\n\n- Sign the necessary files (using \"sudo sbctl verify\", then \"sudo sbctl sign -s <file>\").\n\n\nIf system files are signed:\n\n- Boot into your OS on your Steam Deck;\n\n- Find the \"PK.key\", \"KEK.key\" and \"db.key\" files that were created with \"sbctl create-keys\" (I used the command: sudo find / -type f -name \"*.key\");\n\n- Use the commands \"mokutil --pk\", \"mokutil --kek\" and \"mokutil --db\" to see the keys that are still enrolled into the system;\n\n- And the following commands to delete each key, one by one (you might have to run some of these multiple times, to account for the multiple keys):\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/PK.key PK\",\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/KEK.key KEK\", and\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/db.key db\"\n\nAfter there are no more keys showing up when the mokutil commands are ran, you should be able to use \"sbctl status\", and see that there are no \"vendor keys\"; Now you can reboot your system, and secure boot should be disabled! Yay!\n\nI combined these steps from these two great guides, thank you very much to the authors:\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Assisted_process_with_sbctl\n\nhttps://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SecureBootForSteamDeck",

Instead of defaulting to Keyboard and Mouse controls, games will keep the Controller UI, and in some cases, will entirely bar me from certain functions (i.e. riding a mount in Palworld) as there is simply no input to do it. This is not a consistent problem, as games like Abiotic Factor are able to be played just fine with keyboard and mouse, but certain games don't have the built-in functions to receive keyboard and mouse inputs instead of Steam Deck inputs. I've looked all over online and have found no real way to fix this, even trying to boot up games with various versions of Proton. I am losing my mind, and am begging for some way to be able to either \"trick\" my games into thinking a computer is running them, or anything else that might work. Thank you. ",

Basically if we have negative air pressure in the room I risk burning up my oven control units very quickly. As you can imagine this is expensive both to repair and both in time. Air pressure can be controlled with the facilitation of a make up air system and multiple exhaust fans that can be individually switched on and off. \n\nIdeally I’d have sensor that goes off and sounds an audible alarm if say there is too much negative air pressure so that the bakers can adjust things.\n\nDoes something like this exist ready to go out of the box?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello, I am a bit tech challenged and I spent the last several years kinda nervous about Alexas and similar devices (It doesn't have to be Alexa specifically but I'm kinda like the gma that calls all video games Nintendo regardless of what console it is, even though I'm only 35.) but I was nervous before because I'd heard about them getting hacked and stuff like that. And I do still want to be safety minded for any risks there might be for things like that. But I'm also going through a lot of big life changes right now that having a little help from an at home assistant type device would be super helpful where I can just tell it a thing and it will remind me or add it to other devices and stuff like that. I'm also getting some home security stuff (free through my internet provider), but being able to connect all that stuff together or having all the devices stuff connected to my phone & the Alexa would be so helpful and maybe help me understand some of it a bit better. I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

I can get them to all come back if I powercycle all of my Echos at the same time, but they start dropping off again within an hour.\n\nI'm at a dead-end as far as troubleshooting.

As I previously mentioned, all firmware is up to date.  If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'd be tearing my hair out if I had any left.  Thank you in advance.",

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "title": "Turn ESP32 devices into through-wall motion sensors",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

(and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "selftext": "Christmas post… thinking about it already! I’m looking for a compact smart plug that sits between an outlet and a device. When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

    "selftext": "My parents have a lovely little property with a garden and a few acres of land. It’s their pride and joy... they take care of it all themselves, from flower beds to chickens.\n\nBut lately I’ve noticed it’s becoming harder for them to keep track of everything.... Cars pull into the wrong driveway, random animals wander near the fence line, and sometimes packages get left at weird spots around the yard. Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar? Any recommendations for brands or setups that don’t need heavy installation or complicated apps?",

None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

Air pressure can be controlled with the facilitation of a make up air system and multiple exhaust fans that can be individually switched on and off. \n\nIdeally I’d have sensor that goes off and sounds an audible alarm if say there is too much negative air pressure so that the bakers can adjust things.\n\nDoes something like this exist ready to go out of the box?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "title": "Turn ESP32 devices into through-wall motion sensors",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "title": "Air pressure sensor with audio warning?",
    "selftext": "Hi all\n\nKind of an odd post for this thread but I own a commercial bakery and I have a need for an air pressure sensor. Basically if we have negative air pressure in the room I risk burning up my oven control units very quickly. As you can imagine this is expensive both to repair and both in time. Air pressure can be controlled with the facilitation of a make up air system and multiple exhaust fans that can be individually switched on and off. \n\nIdeally I’d have sensor that goes off and sounds an audible alarm if say there is too much negative air pressure so that the bakers can adjust things.\n\nDoes something like this exist ready to go out of the box?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

Ideally, I’d like to avoid having several different hubs.\n\nI noticed that the new Echo Dot Max has a built-in smart hub supporting Zigbee, Matter, and Thread Border Router.\nIf I understand correctly, does this mean I wouldn’t need any additional hubs, and I could connect different Zigbee or Matter devices directly to Alexa?\n\nIs the Echo Dot Max good choice as smart home hub? Is Alexa a good choice for simple automation setups?\n\nWhich protocol would you recommend — Matter, Zigbee?\n\nAny recommendations for socket relays and motion/presence sensors that work well with Alexa?\n\nThanks in advance for any tips or personal experiences!",

Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "selftext": "Hey, Some of you might remember my original LightTrack project from about 6 months ago. The feedback was amazing and inspired me to build a completely redesigned version 2.0 based on your suggestions.\n\nAfter months of work, here are the biggest upgrades:\n\n* **🧠 Radar + Predictive AI:** It now uses a mmWave radar to not just detect motion, but to analyze its trajectory. A new ESP32-S3 processor predicts your movement and lights the path ahead of you. No more stepping into the dark.\n* **🌧️ All-Weather Outdoor Version:** I designed and 3D-printed a fully waterproof enclosure with potted electronics, so it works perfectly on garden paths, decks, and outdoor stairs.\n* **🚫 Exclusion Zones:** You can now draw \"dead zones\" on a radar map via a web UI. This tells the system to ignore movement in specific areas, like around your bed or a pet's food bowl.\n* **💡 Flawless Line of Light:** Upgraded to a high-density LED strip for a smooth, continuous glow with no visible dots.\n\nAs always, the project is **fully open-source**. You can find all the code, schematics, and 3D models on my GitHub: [**https://github.com/DiyYari/LightTrack-VISION**](https://github.com/DiyYari/LightTrack-VISION)\n\nFor those who'd rather skip the soldering, I've also launched a **Kickstarter** for a ready-to-install kit (both indoor and outdoor versions). Your support would mean the world to me!\n\n➡️ **Check out the Kickstarter here:** [**https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diy-yari/lighttrack-vision-smart-lighting-that-moves-with-you**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diy-yari/lighttrack-vision-smart-lighting-that-moves-with-you)\n\nI'll be here all day to answer any questions.

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

Hit the power button via the app and sure enough it went off.\n\nWent into SmartThings linked services and reconnected it successfully to the Sengled cloud. Device is now controllable again in Smartthings.\n\nI know most (if not all) people that have Sengled devices have moved on to non-cloud dependent devices, but figured anyone that still has a Sengled device and has been using the manual control button since their cloud service went offline, might want to know that it's back up again. Guess we'll see how long it lasts this time.\n\n  \nEdit: 10/20/2025 was when traffic started logging in my firewall again for the Sengled device.",

Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I’ve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I’m wondering if there’s a better alternative.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4–5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you’ve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn’t a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance — and if you’ve built something like this, I’d love to see your setup!",

I can set the HA things later. \n\nI Thought KNX would be the way, but there are still a few disadvantages:\n\n- I cant program ETS by myself\n- I would like to have the main functions to work with KNX (heating, shading, lights, main door lock, garage door) to be controled over switches AND something like a Shelly walldisplay which should have all functions.\n\nSo my questions is:\n-Is it possible to control shading, main door lock etc. also over HA? (Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

It’s all been working fine through Home Assistant and Apple Home, but I’m starting to feel the mess of having multiple bridges and protocols.\n\nSo now I’m trying to go “Matter-only” as much as possible. My next step is replacing the IKEA Zigbee shades. I came across Bringnox blinds that natively support Matter and connect directly to Apple Home without a bridge, which sounds like a good fit for where I’m headed.\n\nHas anyone here gone through a similar migration — especially with shades or blinds? Any tips on what works smoothly under Matter right now?",

    "selftext": "Hey, Some of you might remember my original LightTrack project from about 6 months ago. The feedback was amazing and inspired me to build a completely redesigned version 2.0 based on your suggestions.\n\nAfter months of work, here are the biggest upgrades:\n\n* **🧠 Radar + Predictive AI:** It now uses a mmWave radar to not just detect motion, but to analyze its trajectory. A new ESP32-S3 processor predicts your movement and lights the path ahead of you. No more stepping into the dark.\n* **🌧️ All-Weather Outdoor Version:** I designed and 3D-printed a fully waterproof enclosure with potted electronics, so it works perfectly on garden paths, decks, and outdoor stairs.\n* **🚫 Exclusion Zones:** You can now draw \"dead zones\" on a radar map via a web UI. This tells the system to ignore movement in specific areas, like around your bed or a pet's food bowl.\n* **💡 Flawless Line of Light:** Upgraded to a high-density LED strip for a smooth, continuous glow with no visible dots.\n\nAs always, the project is **fully open-source**. You can find all the code, schematics, and 3D models on my GitHub: [**https://github.com/DiyYari/LightTrack-VISION**](https://github.com/DiyYari/LightTrack-VISION)\n\nFor those who'd rather skip the soldering, I've also launched a **Kickstarter** for a ready-to-install kit (both indoor and outdoor versions). Your support would mean the world to me!\n\n➡️ **Check out the Kickstarter here:** [**https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diy-yari/lighttrack-vision-smart-lighting-that-moves-with-you**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diy-yari/lighttrack-vision-smart-lighting-that-moves-with-you)\n\nI'll be here all day to answer any questions.

It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "title": "Been testing Bringnox smart shades with HomeKit for 3 weeks — here’s what I learned",
    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

But when I tried to use the DIY function where I physically put the remote up to the IR blaster so it can read the signal outputted by the remote so that it can read that signal and out put it itself, it doesn't work but when I tried the remote on the ac itself it does work. AC doesnt support a wifi function so it won't work with the TCL home app. The Smart IR blaster is an OEM tuya remote. \n\nI first tried to consult this to an AI model but it said that remotes often transmit a long code containing temperature, modes and whatnot and that the IR receiver of the blaster might not be picking that long code and only picking up a quick bit of it. Then it just said to bring this up to a community so here I am. I think my problem might not be with TCL but that I'm trying to use an AC",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nAfter years of saying I’d never get into the whole smarthome thing (“I can just get off the couch and turn on the lights myself”), I’ve finally caved.  \nUp until now, my only smart device was my robot vacuum — *Consuela* — but it’s time for something new.\n\nI want to build a **wake-up light** setup in my bedroom that can also double as extra lighting during the darker winter months.\n\n**The plan:**  \nI’m thinking of installing a **4–5 meter LED strip** between the edge of my dropped ceiling and my curtains, using an L-profile so the light shines down and bounces softly off the curtains. Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I’ve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I’m wondering if there’s a better alternative.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4–5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you’ve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn’t a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance — and if you’ve built something like this, I’d love to see your setup!",

Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup?

I have Starlink, so I have very very few issues with connectivity.   \nDo I need a hub for my set up? or if I do need one, what's a decent basic hub to control 5 or 6 bulbs in a small (1400sq ft) house? I don't want a voice activated system like Alexa or Google Home. Something more simple. What are your suggestions? I'm not trying to create some massive home network here.    \nOverthinking here!  ",

    "selftext": "Hey, Some of you might remember my original LightTrack project from about 6 months ago. The feedback was amazing and inspired me to build a completely redesigned version 2.0 based on your suggestions.\n\nAfter months of work, here are the biggest upgrades:\n\n* **🧠 Radar + Predictive AI:** It now uses a mmWave radar to not just detect motion, but to analyze its trajectory. A new ESP32-S3 processor predicts your movement and lights the path ahead of you. No more stepping into the dark.\n* **🌧️ All-Weather Outdoor Version:** I designed and 3D-printed a fully waterproof enclosure with potted electronics, so it works perfectly on garden paths, decks, and outdoor stairs.\n* **🚫 Exclusion Zones:** You can now draw \"dead zones\" on a radar map via a web UI. This tells the system to ignore movement in specific areas, like around your bed or a pet's food bowl.\n* **💡 Flawless Line of Light:** Upgraded to a high-density LED strip for a smooth, continuous glow with no visible dots.\n\nAs always, the project is **fully open-source**. You can find all the code, schematics, and 3D models on my GitHub: [**https://github.com/DiyYari/LightTrack-VISION**](https://github.com/DiyYari/LightTrack-VISION)\n\nFor those who'd rather skip the soldering, I've also launched a **Kickstarter** for a ready-to-install kit (both indoor and outdoor versions). Your support would mean the world to me!\n\n➡️ **Check out the Kickstarter here:** [**https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diy-yari/lighttrack-vision-smart-lighting-that-moves-with-you**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diy-yari/lighttrack-vision-smart-lighting-that-moves-with-you)\n\nI'll be here all day to answer any questions.

    "selftext": "Hello! Our house which we moved into a few months ago has a strange beeping sound. It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

Looking for a replacement for the Nest that isn't Google as they can eat my whole ass if they think I'm giving them a damn dime after disabling my perfectly good thermostat. I'm open to any options, but an option where I can't be locked back out would be welcome if I need to setup home assistant I can, but just haven't cared much for the moment as I have minimal devices. \n\nWhat would you guys recommend?",

Browsed to their site (us.sengled.com) and they have an \"opening soon\" message that their store will be taking a break from 10/6 to 10/20 (already passed lol).\n\nI opened the Sengled app today for the first time in a month or 2, just to see if anything there had changed. Sure enough, I was prompted to login and it logged in successfully this time, and my device was listed. Hit the power button via the app and sure enough it went off.\n\nWent into SmartThings linked services and reconnected it successfully to the Sengled cloud. Device is now controllable again in Smartthings.\n\nI know most (if not all) people that have Sengled devices have moved on to non-cloud dependent devices, but figured anyone that still has a Sengled device and has been using the manual control button since their cloud service went offline, might want to know that it's back up again. Guess we'll see how long it lasts this time.\n\n  \nEdit: 10/20/2025 was when traffic started logging in my firewall again for the Sengled device.",

I've tried joining him and am unable to as well, and we've tried normal terraria and that doesn't work either. \n\nSomething to note is we live in a college dorm, and don't have control over our internet, so port forwarding and messing with router settings is not an option. \n\nI've tried playing Black Ops 3 Zombies with some friends and that won't work either due to the network problems, but am unsure if that's the problem we're having with terraria. \n\nAre we just screwed when it comes to playing some games until we move out of the dorm? Most other games work perfectly fine, but we both want to do a calamity world, so if anyone can help, that would be great. ",

My NVIDIA driver however is on 581.42, I'm a little hesitant on getting the latest one because I don't play those games that it supports. Can anyone help me diagnose the problem with my laptop, I've only bought it for a year ",

I should’ve not done anything but being stupid I did. I followed the guides provided exactly. Uninstalled them, tried to reinstall them and when I did that the reinstall would stop half way and my taskbar would completely disappear and I would be stuck (the second picture) it pushed all my apps to my main monitor (I swear it’s usually not that disorganized and I was actually in the process of organizing even more) this happened when the display drivers were being installed.\n\nI decided it might be best to restart my PC as I couldn’t find anything online to help me with this specific issue so I did. Mistake. When I tried to open it again I would get the usual boot up of the spiral on my main monitor but then nothing, no logo, the system seemed alive I can move my mouse across the screen and there was a little white line at the top left of my main monitor so I know it’s not my monitors being fried. I looked up how to fix this online and followed these : https://dtptips.com/🖥%EF%B8%8F-fix-windows-10-11-black-screen-with-cursor-step-by-step-guide/#google_vignette , https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/2328305/my-computer-screen-is-black-but-i-can-see-my-curse\n\n•\t⁠I can’t access task manager (ctrl+alt+delete)\n•\t⁠I tried pressing the delete key over and over as some tutorials suggested to open something up (didn’t work)\n•\t⁠I tried opening it in safe mode which was a success at first but I was unable to connect to the internet or do anything meaningful like delete and apps or make any changes, it just simply wouldn’t let me (I couldn’t even open task manager, I think I did manage to access the start up apps and turn them all off tho incase something was interfering)\n•\t⁠I’ve used the turning computer on and off methods to open it in automatic repair mode, it couldn’t do anything as it couldn’t reach a network so I opened the troubleshoot option and tried to system restore to an earlier version which initially worked however my drivers were still not installed and my second monitor wouldn’t activate (display drivers still not installed) I tried finding my exact amd driver specs to download those specific drivers, it didn’t work so I did their automatic diagnostic again and the same issue happened.\n•\t⁠I’ve turned off all my antivirus and firewalls while trying to run the new AMD drivers as suggested on their official help page : https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/RSX2-INSTALL.html (still did that thing where it stopped and I ended on the second photo\n•\t⁠I decided it was time to fully reset my PC from the automatic repair screen as nothing else had worked. Once it was finished, same thing. Black screen, mouse able to move, nothing else.\n\nNow I can’t even access an older version to restore it too everything just goes back to that black screen, entering it in safe mode doesn’t even work anymore but I can still access the automatic diagnosis screen.\n\nMy pc is currently off and unplugged, I have some equipment I was worried would get corrupted so I disconnected them\n\nSomeone please help I have to pay 184$ for a geek squad guy to come out and help me with this if I can’t fix this on my own",

The weird thing is, is that when it finally turns on it doesn't act like a full shut off in the case of everything being closed, it actually turns on with all the apps I had left open when I shut the lid (for example: discord and opera).

But if I watch any video on Magic The Noah's channel, after a little bit the video will freeze but the audio will keep going. Scrolling fixes it but after a few minutes the video will freeze again. Never happens on any other channel but his. It happens every time I've watched one of his videos since finding the channel a year ago. Doesn't happen on any other device.",

I’ve always been an Android girl, but I finally caved and bought myself an iPhone 17 💅✨ (it’s pretty, I’ll admit).\n\nProblem is — I have *no idea* how to move my MP3s from my Windows PC to this thing. I tried Apple Music and iTunes, and yes, I somehow managed to sync them (small victory dance 💃)... but now all my songs are just dumped into **one big messy folder**. 😭\n\nOn my PC I had everything perfectly organized — *Bryan Adams*, *Britney Spears*, *90s throwbacks*, the whole vibe 🎧💖  \nBut on my iPhone… chaos. Just pure, unorganized chaos.\n\nAlso, my iCloud’s already crying — only 4GB left and my music folder is around 20GB 😬 So uploading everything there isn’t an option.\n\nCan anyone tell me if there’s a way to keep my cute little music folders separate on iPhone, just like on my PC? Or is that too much to ask in Apple land? 😅\n\nHelp a girl out, please 🥹💿💕",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m running into a frustrating issue with my HP laptop. After a recent Windows 11 security update, my Intel Wi-Fi card completely disappeared from Windows. Here’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n**Symptoms:**\n\n* No Wi-Fi icon in taskbar\n* Device Manager → Network adapters only shows:\n   * Realtek Gaming GbE (Ethernet)\n   * Kernel Debug Network Adapter\n   * WAN Miniports\n   * Bluetooth PAN (hidden)\n* Intel driver installer seems to install fine, but nothing changes after I restart, when I go to try again, it installs as if the previous install attempt never existed\n* netsh wlan show drivers shows no Wi-Fi interface\n* PnP scans and power cycles don’t help\n\n**Steps I’ve tried:**\n\n1. Reinstalled the Intel Wi-Fi driver\n2. Checked BIOS → WLAN set to Auto, updated BIOS to F.53 Rev.A\n3. Hard reset / power cycle / battery disconnect\n4. Show hidden devices → no wifi driver\n\n**Additional info:**\n\n* Ethernet works fine, no issues with other devices\n* Card worked fine before the update; no physical damage\n\nAt this point, Windows cannot detect the Intel Wi-Fi card at all, and I’m debating a full clean Windows reinstall. Before I do that, I wanted to see if anyone has experienced something similar with an HP Omen and an Intel AX card after a Windows 11 update.",

Usually if I just shut it down then back up it doesn't do it again. Just seems odd that it's not consistently doing this which kind of makes me believe it's not an issue with the SSDs but maybe my hunch is wrong here.\n\nEdit: unplugged all the SSDs, removed the gpu then put it back in and reconnected all the SSDs and it's still randomly losing connection after working fine for quite some time.",

I thought it could be some overheating problem enev though it never reached over 75-80 when on full power after some time, changed thermal paste and it reduced like 20°C but problem persisted, today I tried 1080p furMark and it ran for like... 5 seconds before the screen turned off (not signal thing) and the fans either stopped or lowered a lot, the rub was still on though. After this all I can do is shut down the pc by holding the power button, once I turned the pc on again the device manager showed the gpu driver as deactivated. Turning it on gives me an AMD bug report tool driver error... Google says it could be a power issue, considering that I am using a sata to PCI-e adapter I don't see it that far fetched but... I want to know if the GPU is fcked or if anyone knows if this is a symptom of something else or specific, like a dead memory on the gpu I can replace or something...\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n[Here's a video of the problem](https://youtu.be/Wz9VYNWohuM?si=_JoY1cU46uVOTKEp)\n\n\nUPDATE.\n\nDrivers don't show problems after restart (no warning triangle symbol in device manager) but... it just crashed when I open an image... it was 4K, but still it is just an image! What is happening?",

Nothing on the keyboard lights up (No RGB, no status LEDs) & the top of the front 3 case fans doesn’t spin. All other fans (bottom 2 intake, CPU fans & 2 exhaust fans) spin. EZ Debug LEDs on the Motherboard pop up briefly in red and yellow - the manual suggests that this is an issue with the CPU/DRAM, but powering the machine off (Holding the power button for \\~10 seconds) & back on makes everything work again.\n\n# Steps I've taken so far\n\n* Tried RAM tunings at **6000MHz**, 5600MHz, & with EXPO disabled at 4800MHZ\n* **Disabled** / Enabled ERP in the BIOS\n* **Disabled** / Enabled System Fault Power Protection\n* **Disabled** / Enabled Windows' Fast Startup\n* Disabled / **Enabled** Memory Context Restore\n* Disabled / **Enabled** Memory Power Down \n* Updated [BIOS to the Latest version](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/MAG-B650-TOMAHAWK-WIFI/support) (21st of October 2025)\n* Disabled / **Enabled** CPU -0.05v undervolt (Have had this enabled since building the PC)\n* **Disabled** / Enabled CPU built-in graphics\n* Ran Windows Memory Diagnostics (Clean on both sticks)\n* Changed sleep settings within Windows (Currently only **S3 is enabled**, S0 / S4 / Fast Startup disabled)\n* Updated CPU drivers, GPU drivers, Chipset drivers to the latest versions\n\nI haven't tested each one of these setting individually, however I've tested multiple combinations of each. Settings in bold are what I'm currently using, and the issue still persists.\n\n**PC Specs:** \n\n* AMD 7700X CPU \n* AMD 7800XT GPU (XFX Speedster QICK 319 Core Edition)\n* 32GB 6000mhz Kingston FURY Beast Black RAM (KF560C30BBEK2-32)\n* Corsair RM850E PSU\n* Corsair iCUE 4000D case\n* MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi Motherboard\n* Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120SE \n* 1TB WD BLACK SN850X M2 Boot SSD (99% health)\n* 500GB Samsung 850 Evo (93% health)\n* 3x assorted hard drives with no SMART errors\n* Windows 11 Professional\n\nThis has started happening as of around a couple of months ago. I was originally on the BIOS from 26/12/2024 & only updated after the issues started. The only significant hardware change I've had since purchasing the PC is a new power supply, however this was many months before the issue started, and I didn't re use any cables. I understand that Hibernation is an alternative option, but I don't want to use my SSD's cycles on that, even if it is a minor thing it'll still bug me in the long run. Besides, I'm looking for a fix, not a patchwork solution.\n\nThe only daisy chained fans are the 2 fans connected to the CPU fan header, each other fan has its own fan header on the motherboard.\n\nWindows doesn't show any error logs relating to this - apart from the typical \"The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first.\" when booting back into Windows after the error. This is because the system won't even get to Windows when waking from sleep.\n\nWould appreciate any help, thanks.",

This is especially true in fps video games. Sometimes my aim is so bad when it does stutter, and even the LMB doesn’t work in the same time frame that my cursor doesn’t move. It is so annoying and even infuriating that I can’t use this. Other mouses work fine, and the batteries are brand  new. \n\nThanks",

My mouse will become completely unusable and then my screen will go black but come back a second or two later, sometimes this has also caused my PC to entirely reboot. I have no idea if this is a hardware or software issue and any advice would be appreciated, if i cannot figure this out i'm planning to go to my local computer repair shop to get some help. Thank you for your time!",

She's had two different laptop since we moved in and it happens with both of them.\n\nI know it sounds crazy but what could possibly be the explanation here?\n\n  \nETA: we don't honestly have too many devices plugged into wi-fi at once.

I've tried joining him and am unable to as well, and we've tried normal terraria and that doesn't work either. \n\nSomething to note is we live in a college dorm, and don't have control over our internet, so port forwarding and messing with router settings is not an option. \n\nI've tried playing Black Ops 3 Zombies with some friends and that won't work either due to the network problems, but am unsure if that's the problem we're having with terraria. \n\nAre we just screwed when it comes to playing some games until we move out of the dorm? Most other games work perfectly fine, but we both want to do a calamity world, so if anyone can help, that would be great. ",

I should’ve not done anything but being stupid I did. I followed the guides provided exactly. Uninstalled them, tried to reinstall them and when I did that the reinstall would stop half way and my taskbar would completely disappear and I would be stuck (the second picture) it pushed all my apps to my main monitor (I swear it’s usually not that disorganized and I was actually in the process of organizing even more) this happened when the display drivers were being installed.\n\nI decided it might be best to restart my PC as I couldn’t find anything online to help me with this specific issue so I did. Mistake. When I tried to open it again I would get the usual boot up of the spiral on my main monitor but then nothing, no logo, the system seemed alive I can move my mouse across the screen and there was a little white line at the top left of my main monitor so I know it’s not my monitors being fried. I looked up how to fix this online and followed these : https://dtptips.com/🖥%EF%B8%8F-fix-windows-10-11-black-screen-with-cursor-step-by-step-guide/#google_vignette , https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/2328305/my-computer-screen-is-black-but-i-can-see-my-curse\n\n•\t⁠I can’t access task manager (ctrl+alt+delete)\n•\t⁠I tried pressing the delete key over and over as some tutorials suggested to open something up (didn’t work)\n•\t⁠I tried opening it in safe mode which was a success at first but I was unable to connect to the internet or do anything meaningful like delete and apps or make any changes, it just simply wouldn’t let me (I couldn’t even open task manager, I think I did manage to access the start up apps and turn them all off tho incase something was interfering)\n•\t⁠I’ve used the turning computer on and off methods to open it in automatic repair mode, it couldn’t do anything as it couldn’t reach a network so I opened the troubleshoot option and tried to system restore to an earlier version which initially worked however my drivers were still not installed and my second monitor wouldn’t activate (display drivers still not installed) I tried finding my exact amd driver specs to download those specific drivers, it didn’t work so I did their automatic diagnostic again and the same issue happened.\n•\t⁠I’ve turned off all my antivirus and firewalls while trying to run the new AMD drivers as suggested on their official help page : https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/RSX2-INSTALL.html (still did that thing where it stopped and I ended on the second photo\n•\t⁠I decided it was time to fully reset my PC from the automatic repair screen as nothing else had worked. Once it was finished, same thing. Black screen, mouse able to move, nothing else.\n\nNow I can’t even access an older version to restore it too everything just goes back to that black screen, entering it in safe mode doesn’t even work anymore but I can still access the automatic diagnosis screen.\n\nMy pc is currently off and unplugged, I have some equipment I was worried would get corrupted so I disconnected them\n\nSomeone please help I have to pay 184$ for a geek squad guy to come out and help me with this if I can’t fix this on my own",

I tried every way to remove the web search to see if the store no longer appears, ofc I don't have the web search anymore, but every time i check after doing something the store is still there. This is driving me crazy, I'm already considering uninstalling the Microsoft Store using some program.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m running into a frustrating issue with my HP laptop. After a recent Windows 11 security update, my Intel Wi-Fi card completely disappeared from Windows. Here’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n**Symptoms:**\n\n* No Wi-Fi icon in taskbar\n* Device Manager → Network adapters only shows:\n   * Realtek Gaming GbE (Ethernet)\n   * Kernel Debug Network Adapter\n   * WAN Miniports\n   * Bluetooth PAN (hidden)\n* Intel driver installer seems to install fine, but nothing changes after I restart, when I go to try again, it installs as if the previous install attempt never existed\n* netsh wlan show drivers shows no Wi-Fi interface\n* PnP scans and power cycles don’t help\n\n**Steps I’ve tried:**\n\n1. Reinstalled the Intel Wi-Fi driver\n2. Checked BIOS → WLAN set to Auto, updated BIOS to F.53 Rev.A\n3. Hard reset / power cycle / battery disconnect\n4. Show hidden devices → no wifi driver\n\n**Additional info:**\n\n* Ethernet works fine, no issues with other devices\n* Card worked fine before the update; no physical damage\n\nAt this point, Windows cannot detect the Intel Wi-Fi card at all, and I’m debating a full clean Windows reinstall. Before I do that, I wanted to see if anyone has experienced something similar with an HP Omen and an Intel AX card after a Windows 11 update.",

I've tried joining him and am unable to as well, and we've tried normal terraria and that doesn't work either. \n\nSomething to note is we live in a college dorm, and don't have control over our internet, so port forwarding and messing with router settings is not an option. \n\nI've tried playing Black Ops 3 Zombies with some friends and that won't work either due to the network problems, but am unsure if that's the problem we're having with terraria. \n\nAre we just screwed when it comes to playing some games until we move out of the dorm? Most other games work perfectly fine, but we both want to do a calamity world, so if anyone can help, that would be great. ",

My **Huawei Y6 (2018)** keeps restarting on its own whenever someone calls me — through **WhatsApp**, **SIM**, or even sometimes while I’m **scrolling Facebook** or **attending an online class**.\n\nSometimes it restarts **instantly when a call comes in**, and sometimes **right after I pick it up**.\n\nIt all started after I made a few changes to the phone:\n\n* I inserted a **128GB memory card** and formatted it as **internal storage** because my phone only has **2GB RAM** and **16GB internal memory**.\n* I also **replaced the battery** (possibly a third-party one).\n* I used **Files by Google** to move my data to the SD card.\n\nSoon after that, the phone began restarting randomly — especially during calls.\n\n\n\n**What I’ve Tried So Far:**\n\n* **Removed the memory card** and tried using the phone without it — the problem still happens.\n* **Factory reset** the phone completely and set it up as a new device (without SD card).\n* Even during the initial setup process, it **restarted once or twice**.\n* It seemed fine for a while after setup, but today I **reinstalled WhatsApp**, tested a call, and it **restarted again**.\n\n\n\n**Device Info:**\n\n* **Model:** Huawei Y6 (2018)\n* **Android version:** 8\n* **RAM / Storage:** 2GB / 16GB\n* **Battery:** Replaced (non-original, possibly third-party)\n* **No overheating noticed**\n* **Currently not using any SD card**\n\n\n\n**What I Think Might Be Wrong:**  \nAt this point, I’m confused — could it be:\n\n* A **battery or power IC issue** from the replacement?\n* A **firmware bug or corrupted system partition** that the factory reset didn’t fix?\n* Or did I somehow damage or delete a key system file earlier when I formatted the SD card as internal?\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice — like if reflashing the stock ROM might fix it, or if it’s more likely a hardware issue.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "My **A4Tech FB26CS Air2** Bluetooth mouse goes to sleep after just a few seconds of inactivity, and it takes about 1–2 seconds to wake up — super annoying.\n\nThe manual mentions an **“Anti-Sleep Setting Mode for PC,”** but I don’t get why it’s “for PC” and not for the mouse itself. I just want to stop the **mouse** from sleeping so quickly.\n\nDoes anyone know if there’s a way to adjust or disable the sleep timer on this model, or change something in Windows to fix it?",

My NVIDIA driver however is on 581.42, I'm a little hesitant on getting the latest one because I don't play those games that it supports.
